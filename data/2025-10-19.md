### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于多智能体对话的零样本食物识别框架，通过结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型实现无需额外训练的食物分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，难以处理未见过的食物类别，需要开发无需标注的智能食物识别方法。

Method: 采用多智能体对话框架，包含对象感知令牌(OPT)提取细粒度视觉特征，交互式推理智能体(IRA)进行多轮视觉-文本对话推理，实现零样本食物识别。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确率和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能食物质量检测和分析提供了新范式，展示了多智能体对话在复杂食物场景理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [2] [Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于分割子宫内膜异位症中常见暗色植入物的系统，旨在辅助妇科医生进行腹腔镜手术视频分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多样化的视觉表现，且发生在体内不同位置，这使得其识别对于非专科医生来说非常困难且容易出错。

Method: 开发了一个能够分析腹腔镜手术视频的系统，该系统经过训练可以分割暗色子宫内膜植入物，并用多色叠加标注识别出的植入区域，同时显示检测摘要以改进视频浏览。

Result: 系统能够自动识别和标注子宫内膜异位症的暗色植入区域，为医生提供可视化的检测结果和视频浏览辅助。

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生治疗子宫内膜异位症提供了有效的辅助工具，通过自动化分析提高了诊断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将传统视觉模型（如YOLO）与视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）结合，用于遥感图像分析，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量激增，但传统视觉模型需要大量标注数据且对复杂环境的上下文理解能力有限。视觉语言模型虽然能整合视觉和文本数据，但在遥感领域的应用仍待探索。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与VLMs（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）集成，在标注和未标注的遥感数据以及退化图像场景下进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数方面，平均MAE提升了48.46%，特别是在挑战性条件下。CLIPScore在遥感图像综合理解方面提升了6.17%。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与VLMs的结合为更先进、高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，尤其在少样本学习场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于深度学习的AI系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超越了9位病理学家的诊断一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的重要指标，但该特征在病理诊断中存在漏报和观察者间变异性的问题，需要开发更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习构建深度学习模型，在640张前列腺穿刺活检切片上训练，并在内部和外部验证集上进行评估。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC达0.97，外部验证中AUC达0.90，在观察者间一致性分析中表现最佳（Cohen's kappa: 0.66），优于所有9位病理学家（kappa范围0.35-0.62）。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure是一个扩展的对抗净化框架，能够处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），而现有方法主要针对加性扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中存在多种非加性对抗扰动，但现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳。

Method: 通过建立对抗图像的生成过程，通过似然最大化分离出底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架有效扩展了对抗净化的应用范围，能够处理更广泛的非加性对抗扰动类型。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图结构的检索-推理增强生成框架，用于提升大型视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力。通过结构化图表示和中间推理步骤，解决了传统RAG方法在长视频处理中的时序依赖破坏和无关信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理密集视频token超出上下文窗口和保留长期序列信息的挑战。传统RAG方法应用于长视频时会出现时序依赖破坏和包含无关信息的问题，影响推理准确性。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1）使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系以提升检索效果；2）引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息的显式聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，Vgent相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构和中间推理机制有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，显著提升了大型视频语言模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [7] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型学习的视频同步框架，通过构建共享的1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，解决了非线性时间错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多摄像机视频同步相对简单，但不同场景或生成AI视频的同步面临复杂挑战，包括多样化主题、背景和非线性时间错位。

Method: TPL框架从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建紧凑的1D共享表示，通过学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段，避免耗尽的成对匹配。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在复杂视频同步场景中表现出色，为视频分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本的3D头像生成方法，可从少量非结构化手机图像创建超逼真、身份保持的3D头像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在几何不一致、幻觉问题，且合成数据训练的方法无法捕捉高频细节如皮肤皱纹和细发，限制了真实感。

Method: 采用两步法：(1)生成式规范化模块处理多视图为标准化表示；(2)基于Transformer的模型在大型高斯溅射头像数据集上训练。采用"捕获-规范化-溅射"流程。

Result: 该方法能从非结构化照片生成静态半身头像，具有出色的真实感和鲁棒的身份保持能力。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有技术的局限性，实现了高质量、身份保持的3D头像生成。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析工具在可扩展性、效率和现代科学计算工作流集成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法的可扩展性和效率不足，且缺乏API支持、GPU加速和广泛的3D图像处理能力。

Method: cubic采用设备无关的API，当数据在设备上时调度GPU操作，否则在CPU上执行，无缝加速各种图像处理例程。

Result: 通过基准测试和现有去卷积和分割管道的复现，cubic实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Conclusion: 该框架在虚拟制作中实现了多主体生成、场景和真实视频定制等核心能力，推动了视频生成在虚拟制作中的应用。

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态显性人格识别方法，通过优化联合识别来提高识别效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多使用Big Five进行显性人格识别，但忽略了HEXACO模型中的诚实-谦逊特质，且两种模型在机器学习中的关系尚未明确

Method: 采用联合优化方法同时识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质，使用自我介绍视频数据集进行实验

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质

Conclusion: 通过联合建模Big Five和HEXACO，提高了多模态人类行为感知能力

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面处理的轻量级AI生成图像检测方法，通过噪声特征提取和梯度补丁选择，在GenImage基准上达到98.9%的平均准确率，速度比现有方法快近百倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像重建误差的AI生成图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征，需要更高效准确的检测方案。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理技术提取噪声特征，设计最大梯度补丁选择机制放大噪声信号，采用轻量级分类头进行检测。

Result: 在GenImage基准上平均准确率达98.9%，提升11.9%，跨生成器泛化能力强（GAN到Diffusion 98.2%，Diffusion到GAN 99.2%），检测速度达到毫秒级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了检测效率，为解决AI生成图像检测问题提供了有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态音视频框架PIA，通过整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测现代深度伪造视频，解决了传统检测方法对高级生成模型生成的近乎完美帧的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法主要依赖手动设计的音素-视素对齐阈值、基础帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术等先进生成模型生成的现代深度伪造内容。这些先进技术生成近乎完美的单帧图像，但会无意中产生传统检测器经常忽略的微小时间差异。

Method: 提出PIA（音素-时间和身份-动态分析）多模态音视频框架，整合音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入。该方法通过识别多个互补模态之间的不一致性来检测细微的深度伪造篡改。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，代码已在GitHub上开源。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了现代深度伪造检测的挑战，为应对日益复杂的媒体操纵威胁提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的高计算成本问题，传统Scene Coordinate Regression方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络容量

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理仅激活单个子网络；提出Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing策略提升定位精度

Result: 在Cambridge测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可实现高质量渲染结果，显著降低成本的同时保持更高精度

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效解决方案，在降低计算成本的同时维持了高精度定位和渲染质量

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在处理人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比很小或人物表情动作变化较大时，身份保持效果不佳。

Method: 提出Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO)框架，基于强化学习优化扩散模型，使用人脸身份评分器作为奖励信号，通过反向传播奖励信号到采样链的最后几步来加速收敛，并引入KL散度正则化防止过拟合。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性保持能力，且无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在动态交互场景中难以保持多个人物身份的一致性，这在多人物视频生成中至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，使用针对多人物一致性优化的GRPO变体来优化视频生成策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出MatchAttention机制，通过动态匹配相对位置来解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的挑战，实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的实时匹配


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制存在效率问题

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，通过残差连接跨层迭代更新相对位置，并设计MatchDecoder和遮挡处理组件

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，仅需3GB GPU内存

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的实时高分辨率跨视图匹配，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在稀疏3D训练数据区域难以捕捉细节和保持真实感，需要结合2D技术来弥补这些局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化过程。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 2D-3D混合方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的巧妙结合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中领域偏移问题的有力工具，具有显著的应用潜力

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然在某些任务上表现出色，但仍容易产生幻觉，过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而缺乏视觉接地。

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码方法：1）选择解码层中的成熟层和业余层；2）使用水印相关问题识别视觉接地层；3）应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码方法有效减少了大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高了输出的视觉接地性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统容易受到呈现攻击（如人工眼球、打印眼图像或美容隐形眼镜），但缺乏足够的训练和评估数据集，因为构建和成像呈现攻击存在困难。

Method: 提出MID-StyleGAN框架，结合扩散模型和生成对抗网络，采用多域架构实现真实眼部图像与不同呈现攻击域之间的转换，并使用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数保持域一致性。

Result: 实验表明MID-StyleGAN在生成高质量合成眼部图像方面优于现有方法，生成的合成数据显著提升了PAD系统性能，在LivDet2020数据集上，1%误检率下的真检率从93.41%提高到98.72%。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN为虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过生成逼真多样的合成数据有效增强了呈现攻击检测系统的性能。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Result: VaCo显著提升了不同MLLMs在各种基准测试上的性能，展示了在视觉理解方面的卓越能力

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制有效解决了MLLMs中视觉信息被忽视的问题，为多模态理解提供了新思路

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Motivation: 随着消费级深度相机的普及，大量未标记的RGB-D数据可用，需要探索如何利用这些数据进行场景几何推理。现有RGB-D配准方法多依赖几何和特征相似性，本文采用不同思路。

Method: 使用循环一致性关键点作为显著点来增强匹配时的空间一致性约束；提出新型姿态块，将GRU循环单元与变换同步相结合，融合历史和多视图数据。

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also

TL;DR: SPR（Spatial Preference Rewarding）方法通过奖励MLLMs生成详细且定位准确的区域描述，来增强多模态大语言模型的细粒度空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度空间感知能力上存在不足，如生成详细区域描述或精确定位物体时表现不佳，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。这是因为现有方法主要关注对预标注指令数据的建模，缺乏对MLLMs实际响应的直接监督。

Method: SPR方法通过随机选择图像区域和MLLMs生成的区域描述，引入语义和定位评分来全面评估文本质量和定位质量。通过将定位精度更高的优化描述与最低分的初始描述配对，进行直接偏好优化，从而增强与视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在标准参考和定位基准上的大量实验表明，SPR能够有效提升MLLMs的空间理解能力，且训练开销极小。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过偏好奖励机制成功解决了MLLMs在细粒度空间感知方面的局限性，为提升多模态模型的视觉空间对齐能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时存在对象遗漏和对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象四种场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入后再输入到文本到图像模型中。

Result: DOS在四个基准测试中显著优于四种竞争方法，在人类评估中获得26.24%-43.04%更多的投票，有效提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。

Conclusion: DOS是一种实用且有效的解决方案，能够显著改善多对象图像生成的质量。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤分割提升0.10%，肿瘤核心提升1.75%，增强肿瘤提升0.93%；在系统性五折评估中平均提升肿瘤核心0.86%，增强肿瘤1.45%，同时实现15倍效率提升。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持竞争力的分割精度下显著提升了计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割任务中的鲁棒性和实用性优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于检测主板组装级缺陷的框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，提出置信度-时间投票方法平衡精度和召回率，并开发了可部署的GUI检测工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PCB检测研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，而主板组装级检测领域尚未充分探索，需要开发可靠的检测方法确保电子制造质量。

Method: 提出BoardVision框架，在MiracleFactory数据集上对比YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN检测器，设计轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡不同模型的性能特点，并评估在锐度、亮度和方向变化等实际扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: YOLOv7在精度方面表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反；CTV Voter通过可解释规则有效平衡了精度和召回率，同时揭示了主板缺陷检测中常被忽视的稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术如何从基准测试结果过渡到实际的主板组装制造质量保证应用，为行业提供了实用的检测解决方案。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出DCMIL模型，一种双课程对比多实例学习框架，用于处理全切片图像进行癌症预后预测，无需密集标注，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临计算瓶颈和标注稀缺问题，现有方法忽略多放大倍率下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用由易到难的渐进表示学习策略，通过双课程对比多实例学习处理千兆像素级全切片图像。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万张图像块）上的实验显示DCMIL优于标准预后模型，并能识别细粒度预后相关区域。

Conclusion: DCMIL为癌症预后提供了有效的无监督学习方法，具有识别形态学差异和生成生物学新见解的潜力。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过引入帧内编码工具和同时双帧压缩设计，解决了现有NVC方案在处理遮挡、新内容和帧间误差传播方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容和帧间误差传播方面存在效率低下的问题，需要借鉴传统视频编码中允许帧内编码的技术思路来解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架，每个帧由单一模型处理，该模型经过训练可自适应执行帧内/帧间编码；同时设计同时双帧压缩方案，充分利用前向和后向的帧间冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方案相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的每帧比特率和质量，并保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架的有效性，能够显著提升压缩效率并解决现有方案的局限性，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但深度学习方法对通用对抗扰动攻击仍然脆弱，需要开发更有效的攻击方法来评估模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用核范数正则化来促进背景集中的结构化扰动，并采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化，以提高可扩展性和收敛性。

Result: 该方法在攻击效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击方法，同时保持了高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 提出的攻击方法为视频目标检测系统的安全性评估提供了有效工具，所有代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督学习方法需要大量像素级标注数据且仅适用于特征明确的病理，而无监督深度生成模型仅需健康数据训练，能够识别偏离学习到的正常脑结构的异常，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的罕见或异质性疾病。

Result: 生成模型在检测大范围局灶性病变方面表现出令人鼓舞的性能，在解决更细微异常方面也取得进展。关键优势是能够生成可解释的伪健康重建图像，这对于标注数据稀缺的情况特别有价值。

Conclusion: 无监督深度生成模型为异常检测提供了有前景的方向，支持半监督学习、新成像生物标志物发现以及统一端到端框架内的疾病内和跨疾病偏差映射。未来工作需要优先考虑解剖结构感知建模、基础模型开发、任务适应性评估指标和严格的临床验证。

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩多任务图像恢复模型的策略，通过迭代剪枝方法发现高度稀疏的子网络，在仅保留10%参数的情况下保持高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务图像恢复模型参数量过大，计算效率低下，需要开发压缩方法

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现"中奖彩票"子网络

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上，MIR-L模型仅保留10%可训练参数仍能保持高性能

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在多任务图像恢复模型中存在高度稀疏的子网络，能够在极低参数量的情况下达到或超越原始模型性能

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对每个多边形定义的牧场边界进行二分类预测（放牧/未放牧）

Result: 模型平均F1分数达77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达90%。如果检查员每年最多只能检查4%的场地，使用模型预测优先检查非放牧场地，可使确认的非放牧场地数量比随机检查提高17.2倍

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导保护性土地利用合规检查资源分配

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba具有线性扩展的计算复杂度（相比ViT的二次方扩展）和更少的可训练参数（相比CNN），这些特性使其在图像分类任务中具有计算和内存效率优势。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为主干网络构建神经网络，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率。与ViT和CNN模型进行多方面的性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对精度的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中相比ViT和CNN的上述优势。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT。源代码已公开以促进可重复性和后续研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，在保持推理效率的同时显著提升了生成图像与文本提示的对齐度

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

Method: 使用两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，通过对抗训练和图像重建（将两个特征的重构相加）来确保特征解耦和重建质量。

Result: 在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别任务上达到或优于现有方法，并能可视化域无关和域相关特征，提供高可解释性。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA是一个有效的领域自适应框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升了医学图像分析的可解释性。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，通过重建驱动的预训练方案，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个描述符作为独立但互补的视觉知识组件

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方式通过显式分解视觉属性，为视觉理解提供了有效的学习框架，结合了现代学习的优势与传统描述符的可解释性

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法只进行一步调整，对于不同模态特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集效果有限，需要更精细的多步调整策略。

Method: 提出Flow Matching Alignment方法，使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应，噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺，以及早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在各种基准测试和骨干网络上均取得显著性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA的多步修正能力能够实现更精确和鲁棒的特征对齐，是解决复杂跨模态对齐问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC)的训练自由提示嵌入编辑方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，通过抑制场景与身份之间的内在相关性来提升身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法在生成同一主题的不同场景图像时存在身份偏移问题，且通常需要提前知道所有目标场景，这在现实应用中是不现实的。本文发现身份偏移的主要原因是T2I模型中自然形成的场景与身份之间的相关性（场景上下文化）。

Method: 提出SDeC方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来识别和抑制身份提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性，自适应地重新加权相应的特征值。该方法不需要训练，支持单场景使用，无需提前获取所有目标场景信息。

Result: 实验表明SDeC方法显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，特别适用于现实世界中无法提前获取所有目标场景信息的应用场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

<details>

Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯密度分配不均、计算负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化，这些问题限制了训练效率

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式负载敏感高斯密度控制，自动平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，实现动态负载分配；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，优化RGB存储结构

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上实现了1.44倍的训练加速，同时质量下降可忽略不计

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，为实时3D重建应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.
Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: STANCE是一个图像到视频生成框架，通过Instance Cues和Dense RoPE两个组件解决视频生成中的运动一致性问题，提升时间连贯性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持物体运动一致性和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：运动提示编码后有效token过少导致引导弱化；单一优化目标倾向于纹理而非时间一致性

Method: 1. Instance Cues：将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场，通过实例级光流平均和单目深度增强；2. Dense RoPE：在token空间中保持运动提示的显著性，使用空间可寻址旋转嵌入标记运动token；3. 联合RGB+辅助图预测，分离结构和外观处理

Result: 该方法稳定了优化过程，提高了时间连贯性，无需逐帧轨迹脚本

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，通过分离结构和外观处理以及改进的运动提示机制，显著提升了生成视频的质量

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法有效提升了KB-VQA任务中多模态知识检索的质量和答案生成的准确性

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器的单个连续潜在令牌来表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器，实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时保持自监督学习空间的良好几何特性，实现高效生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练SSL编码器，微调语义令牌嵌入，配合生成解码器使用流匹配目标训练，添加余弦相似度损失正则化潜在空间。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上实现零样本文本到图像合成，训练成本极低。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督学习表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，为高效生成建模提供潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一个仅推理的测试时适应框架，通过Feynman-Kac引导机制指导基于扩散的输入适应，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的输入适应方法依赖梯度引导，限制了在不同失真类型上的探索和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，通过伪标签驱动的奖励函数，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA一致优于基线方法，无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA提供了一种有效的测试时适应方法，通过引导机制实现了更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，利用非配对视频片段进行上下文学习，用于指令驱动的视频编辑任务。该方法通过两阶段训练（预训练+微调）在有限标注数据下实现高质量视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令驱动的图像编辑发展迅速，但视频编辑领域由于大规模配对数据集构建成本高、复杂度大而进展缓慢，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 基于HunyuanVideoT2V框架，首先在约100万真实视频片段上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万精心策划的编辑配对数据上进行微调。采用两阶段训练策略，利用非配对视频实现低成本预训练。

Result: 在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均超越现有方法，编辑指令遵循能力提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了视频编辑数据稀缺问题，证明了通过非配对视频预训练结合少量高质量配对数据微调的有效性，为指令驱动的视频编辑提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE预训练视觉变换器计算成本高、时间长的工业应用限制问题

Method: 在MAE预训练中仅对编码器应用去相关反向传播，减少各层输入相关性以加速收敛

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE减少21.1%训练时间、降低21.4%碳排放，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP方法可在大规模ViT预训练中有效减少训练时间和能耗，同时改善下游性能，具有实际工业应用价值

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期监测采矿引起的土地表面变化以实现可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建多时间基准数据集，支持两个任务：多时间采矿足迹映射（使用新的变化感知时间IoU指标评估）和跨时间变化检测。对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致和可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及将GeoAI应用于社会和环境的更广泛目标。数据集和代码遵循FAIR原则和开放科学范式发布。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WeCKD方法，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链来改进传统知识蒸馏，每个模型从前驱学习并精炼知识后再传递，从而在有限数据场景下实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法存在知识退化、监督效率低、依赖强教师模型或大标注数据集等问题，限制了在真实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 提出弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络(WeCKD)，构建渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型仅使用部分数据集训练，既学习前驱模型知识又进行精炼后传递。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上评估，性能超越现有监督方法；在其他两个数据集上验证了跨医学成像模态的泛化能力；相比单骨干网络在相同有限数据下累积准确率提升达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递链有效降低了数据依赖性，缓解了一步式知识蒸馏的局限性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Method: 构建基于初始压缩高斯的恢复网络，在图像空间建模压缩伪影，并引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，通过恢复图像的监督来优化压缩高斯

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有高斯压缩方法，通过利用学习先验实现了更好的压缩效果，为3DGS压缩提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义，CFSAM在提升性能的同时加速训练收敛且不引入显著计算开销

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Motivation: 现有的层次图像分类方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注，但实际应用中监督信息的粒度因图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求而异，导致标注粒度不一致。

Method: 1. 引入ImageNet-F基准测试，基于ImageNet构建包含基本、从属和细粒度三个认知层次的分类结构；2. 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性，生成反映人类标注行为的混合粒度标签；3. 提出free-grain学习方法，利用视觉语言模型生成伪属性增强语义指导，并通过半监督学习增强视觉指导。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法为处理现实世界中混合粒度监督的层次图像分类提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明和可信赖的AI系统至关重要。现有方法通常需要访问训练数据或真实标签，而DEXTER旨在提供无需这些数据的自然语言解释。

Method: DEXTER框架结合扩散模型和大型语言模型：1）优化文本提示生成类别条件图像以最大化分类器激活；2）使用合成样本生成详细的语言报告，描述决策模式和偏见；3）支持激活最大化、切片发现和去偏、偏见解释三个任务。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces数据集上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类别级偏见报告方面优于现有方法。定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示DEXTER产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER提供了一个灵活且有效的框架，能够在无需训练数据或真实标签的情况下，深入揭示视觉分类器的内部机制和决策过程，为AI系统的透明性和可信赖性提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致和鲁棒图像质量

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的火星表面重建方法，通过训练在12000个火星高度图上的扩散模型，能够比传统插值方法更准确地填补火星地形数据中的缺失值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法无法保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法不适用于火星数据，因此需要开发专门的火星表面重建技术。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在NASA HiRISE调查的12000个火星高度图数据集上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个测试样本上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提高4-15%）和感知相似性（LPIPS提高29-81%）方面均优于逆距离加权、克里金法和Navier-Stokes算法等传统方法。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型是火星地形重建的有效方法，能够生成几何一致且视觉逼真的表面重建结果，为太空探索中的VR应用提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉的微飞行器（MAV）群通信框架，利用运动模式进行信息传递，替代传统无线电通信


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV群中面临频谱拥堵、干扰和高功耗问题，需要一种更可靠的替代方案

Method: 采用事件相机捕获MAV的飞行模式，使用预定义的运动基元（垂直、水平、L形运动）作为控制符号，设计基于事件帧的分割模型和脉冲神经网络进行动作识别

Result: 实验验证了该框架能够准确解码信息并实现低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好的通信性能

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV群提供了一种高效节能的通信替代方案，特别适用于受约束环境

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个新颖的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过引入结构化视觉思维链推理来改进伪标签生成过程，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了语义复杂场景中所需的中层推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本分类识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别相对提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO数据集上AP50提升7.7，在LVIS数据集上新类别mask AP提升2.9，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 结构化视觉思维链推理和对比背景学习构成了一个集成管道，专门针对拥挤或遮挡场景中的鲁棒伪标签生成，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，用于结直肠癌预后预测，通过整合连续变异谱来表征形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，而这些模式代表了影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后的不同生物学过程。结直肠癌是全球第三大常见恶性肿瘤，需要更精确的预后预测方法。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱，反映了恶性转化是通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原则。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上进行训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现出色（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），比现有CRC特异性方法高15%准确率，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的鲁棒性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种创新的、可解释的AI模型，能够准确预测结直肠癌预后，为个性化治疗决策提供了有力工具，特别是在识别可能从不同治疗方案中获益的患者亚群方面。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，显著减少了对手动绘制肿瘤掩模的需求，在多种肿瘤类型检测中表现优于放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI肿瘤检测模型需要大量手动绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中每份CT扫描都配有丰富的医学报告，这些信息未被充分利用于AI训练。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型来分割与医学报告中描述相匹配的肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行训练，减少对人工标注掩模的依赖。

Result: 在101,654份报告上训练的模型性能与使用723个掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模训练使灵敏度提升13%，特异性提升8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测表现优于放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该方法挑战了大规模肿瘤掩模创建不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测提供了可扩展且易于实施的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新颖的轨迹表示学习框架，通过统一环境感知和显式路径选择建模来解决现有方法忽视外部环境和内部路径选择行为的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了影响轨迹形成的外部环境和内部路径选择行为，导致表示效果受限。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器：1）环境感知模块从周围POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义；2）路径选择编码器将道路段转换建模为决策序列，捕捉路径选择行为；3）最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过综合考虑环境因素和路径选择行为，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的效果，具有较强的数据效率和实用价值。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 现有大模型无法在智能手机上部署，因为内存和计算资源有限。量化方法虽然能提高效率，但激进量化会损害模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法，从32位逐步降低到4位精度，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持生成质量。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、PixArt和FLUX.1-schnell等扩散模型上实现了质量提升，FiD比标准QAT降低4-7%。成功在三星S25U手机上部署Sana模型。

Conclusion: 分数位量化方法有效解决了移动设备部署大模型时的质量保持问题，为移动端AI应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肿瘤分割AI模型面临的大规模体素级标注数据缺乏的问题，这些数据难以创建且需要医学专家参与。通过合成数据来提升数据扩展效率。

Method: 首先在3000个标注的胰腺肿瘤扫描数据集（JHH）上发现AI性能在1500个扫描后停止提升。使用合成数据，仅需500个真实扫描即可达到相同性能。基于这一发现，创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描和15,130个肿瘤实例，涵盖六个器官。

Result: AbdomenAtlas 2.0在分布内测试中比公共数据集提升7% DSC，在分布外测试中提升16% DSC。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以显著提升数据扩展效率，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练多器官肿瘤分割AI模型提供了强大基础，并显著优于现有公共数据集。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: ImagerySearch有效解决了想象性视频生成的挑战，LDT-Bench的发布将促进未来想象性视频生成研究的发展。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Conclusion: 该框架将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，有助于医生理解皮肤癌进展过程，提高诊断可解释性。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

TL;DR: 对开源多模态大语言模型在标准人脸识别基准上的系统性能评估，发现MLLMs在零样本应用中落后于专用模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但其在人脸识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，需要对开源MLLMs与现有人脸识别模型进行标准化比较

Method: 在多个标准人脸识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB、RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试

Result: 实验结果显示MLLMs能够捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中落后于专用人脸识别模型

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的人脸识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Free-Form HOI Generation方法，旨在生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体交互，突破了现有方法局限于固定抓握模式的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究主要局限于固定抓握模式，控制依赖于物理先验（如力闭合）或通用意图指令，这种过度泛化的条件限制了日常HOI的多样性表达。

Method: 提出了TOUCH框架，基于多级扩散模型，通过显式接触建模进行条件控制，并利用接触一致性和物理约束进行细化，确保生成的手部姿态超越抓握先验。

Result: 构建了WildO2数据集（包含4.4k个独特交互、92种意图和610个物体类别），实验证明该方法能够生成代表日常活动的可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互（如推、戳、旋转）的生成能力，为手-物体交互研究提供了更细粒度的语义控制。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BADAS是一个专门针对ego-centric碰撞预测的模型家族，通过重新标注数据集和合成负样本，解决了现有方法无法区分ego车辆威胁和随机事故的问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法有效区分ego车辆威胁和随机事故，导致在实际部署中产生过多误报。需要专门针对ego-centric视角的评估基准和模型。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络端到端训练，在Nexar真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据集上训练。提供两个变体：BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）。重新标注主要基准数据集以识别ego参与，添加共识警报时间标签，并在需要时合成负样本。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型家族有效解决了ego-centric碰撞预测问题，发布了BADAS-Open模型权重、代码和所有评估数据集的重新标注，以促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的高效可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高质量可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在生成质量和推理效率方面取得了显著进展，但控制机制在VAR范式下的精确灵活控制仍然研究不足。

Method: ScaleWeaver采用改进的MMDiT块和提出的Reference Attention模块，通过参数重用和零初始化线性投影来有效整合条件信息，同时减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明ScaleWeaver能够实现高质量生成和精确控制，在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver为视觉自回归范式下的可控文本到图像生成提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法，解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类任务中评估自由形式响应的挑战，特别是在高选项数（数百到数千）的多项选择题设置下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多项选择题，无法有效处理细粒度视觉分类中选项数量多且高度相关的情况。同时，在检索式问题中，计算整个选项集的概率计算成本高昂。

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先让MLLM回答开放式问题，然后使用仅文本的约束解码来预测最可能的选择。在检索设置中，采用早停方法计算约束响应选择该选项的概率，显著提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类和检索方面均优于现有方法，且性能在各种自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了高选项数多项选择题和检索式问题中的评估挑战，为细粒度视觉分类任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的新颖视频异常检测框架，通过分析对象活动和交互的文本描述来检测异常，具有可解释性且能与传统方法结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在处理复杂对象交互异常时效果不佳，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用MLLM从正常视频中提取对象对在不同时刻的视觉输入，生成描述活动和交互的文本表示，测试时通过比较文本描述来检测异常。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了复杂交互异常检测问题，还提供了可解释性，并能与传统VAD方法结合提升性能。

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Motivation: 由于密集视频目标描述任务复杂且人工标注成本高昂，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案

Conclusion: 提出的合成标注方法和MaskCaptioner模型有效解决了DVOC任务的标注挑战，为端到端的密集视频理解提供了可行方案

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成超越时间边界的视频时，无法正确处理动态元素和保持场景一致性的问题

Method: 采用双时空条件控制（时间相邻帧和空间相邻内容）+ 3D场景记忆（从输入视频中提取静态几何）+ 动态SLAM与动态掩码策略

Result: 在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效维持长距离空间一致性和精确相机控制，同时保持计算效率和运动真实性

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Motivation: 全身多模态人体运动生成面临两个主要挑战：创建有效的运动生成机制以及将文本、语音和音乐等多种模态整合到统一框架中。现有方法通常采用离散掩码建模或自回归建模，但存在局限性。

Method: 开发了连续掩码自回归运动变换器，采用因果注意力机制考虑人体运动的序列性质。引入门控线性注意力和RMSNorm模块，使变换器关注关键动作并抑制异常运动或多模态异质分布引起的不稳定性。使用DiT结构扩散变换器的条件到目标，增强运动生成和多模态泛化能力。利用AdaLN和交叉注意力融合文本、语音和音乐信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在所有模态（包括文本到运动、语音到手势和音乐到舞蹈）上都优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的连续掩码自回归运动变换器框架在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，有效解决了运动生成和多模态融合的挑战。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效解决了视频生成中的复杂运动合成问题，为视频生成模型的运动质量提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入时间对应关系来扩展现有3D重建方法，解决动态物体破坏多视图几何约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点图的3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确结果，因为运动物体违反了多视图几何约束。

Method: C4D框架除了预测点图外，还捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离移动元素和静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功地将2D轨迹提升为平滑的3D轨迹，实现了完全集成的4D重建，解决了动态场景重建的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中存在可扩展性问题：潜空间方法需要单独训练自编码器增加复杂性，像素空间方法计算密集且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长程时空依赖。

Method: 提出Token-wise Attention机制，集成到U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中，动态捕获多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独潜空间模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进方法，在复杂降水预报场景中具有更好的局部保真度、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过原生集成注意力机制，有效解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性和长程依赖建模问题，取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

*Miao Hu,Zhiwei Huang,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Dahua Lin,Nanning Zheng,Runsen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于解决动态场景下的3D视觉定位问题，强调记忆驱动和主动探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是静态且最新的，这在现实世界中不切实际。需要将3DVG重新定义为主动、记忆驱动的问题。

Method: Mem-ChangingGrounder结合跨模态检索和轻量级多视图融合：识别查询对象类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，高效探索场景，多视图扫描目标，融合证据生成精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高定位精度，同时大幅降低探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3DVG研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集和引入对比身份损失，解决了文本到图像生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了多样化的可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖重建式训练，导致模型直接复制参考人脸而非保持身份在不同姿态、表情和光照下的自然变化，这种copy-paste问题限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，提出量化copy-paste和身份保真度-变化权衡的基准，并引入基于对比身份损失的新训练范式。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了姿态和表情的可控性，同时保持了强感知质量和身份保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高身份相似度的同时实现了表达性可控生成，用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，利用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列和合成交互姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从近距离交互姿态中直觉推断交互动态的上下文信息，这启发了利用交互姿态先验来生成交互动画的研究。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 实验证明该框架在多样化数据集和应用中表现出姿态先验的通用性以及方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator支持图像驱动的交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互的合成，能够将高质量动作捕捉数据的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景中。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点云到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的重建和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示进行世界演化，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点云到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元来联合建模几何和外观；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点潜在的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2挑战性室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面实现了最先进的性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模，支持灵活的多视角渲染，具有精确的多视角一致性和原生3D架构。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过扩散模型展开和视觉语言模型反馈进行端到端优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑模型依赖大规模监督配对的输入-目标对数据，但自然配对的图像数据难以大规模获取，现有方法使用合成数据会传播预训练模型的伪影

Method: 在训练过程中直接展开扩散模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据，该方法在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的扩散模型性能相当，并且在相同VLM作为奖励模型的情况下优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的需求，通过VLM反馈和扩散模型展开实现了有效的图像编辑训练，为无监督图像编辑提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Conclusion: NEO作为可扩展且强大的原生VLMs基石，配以丰富的可重用组件，为成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统奠定基础。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在编辑多视角图像时无法保持视角间一致性，而基于3D表示的方法存在优化过程长、稀疏视角下不稳定的问题

Method: 采用隐式3D正则化方法，通过耦合扩散采样技术同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样，使用耦合项强制执行多视角一致性

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，适用于各种模型架构

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角一致编辑提供了一个通用解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: PoissonNet是一个新的神经网络架构，通过局部-全局学习方案解决网格学习中高频特征学习困难、感受野不足、对离散化敏感和计算效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格网络架构在学习高频特征、感受野范围、离散化敏感性和计算效率之间存在微妙的权衡。需要一种能够克服这些缺陷的新方法。

Method: 基于Poisson方程作为特征传播的主要机制，在网格的梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解Poisson系统来全局传播标量特征更新。

Result: 在语义分割和参数化高细节动画表面等任务中达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有的表面学习架构。

Conclusion: PoissonNet提供了一个高效、可扩展的局部-全局学习框架，能够保持特征的全频谱，提供真正的全局感受野，且对网格三角化不敏感。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论见解和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据一致性损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于替代传统的点对点匹配损失函数，以解决逆问题中过度拟合噪声的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逆问题解决方案使用点对点匹配的数据一致性损失函数，容易导致对测量噪声的过度拟合。本文旨在通过分布层面的校准来避免这一问题。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失函数，通过检验观测测量值是否与当前估计所暗示的噪声分布统计一致，来评估数据一致性。该方法与现有正则化方法兼容，优化方式与传统损失函数相同。

Result: 在图像去噪和医学图像重建两个应用领域验证了DC损失的有效性：在深度图像先验去噪中，DC损失无需早停即可获得更高PSNR；在泊松噪声医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了伪影并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失作为一种统计基础更扎实的替代方案，能够提升逆问题中传统保真度损失的性能，特别是在已知测量噪声分布且测量数据集包含大量独立噪声值的实际应用中。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的后门攻击移除方法，通过分析模型权重空间中后门与良性任务的解耦特性，实现高效的后门消除而不影响模型性能。

Motivation: 基础模型虽然具有广泛泛化能力，但容易受到对抗性扰动和针对性后门攻击。现有后门移除方法需要昂贵的微调，且会降低其他任务的性能。论文旨在研究是否能在不损害模型通用能力的前提下移除后门。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的。基于这一发现，提出了一种简单的遗忘方法，利用这种解耦特性来隔离和消除后门的影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗触发器的实验中，该方法实现了近乎完美的后门遗忘，同时平均保持96%的干净准确率。即使攻击未知，通过反向工程触发器也能成功移除后门。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有最先进防御方法，在遗忘效果和干净准确率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present

*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow是一种基于策略的流模型，通过修改学生模型的输出层来预测网络无关的策略，从而在少量步骤内实现快速准确的ODE积分，避免了传统蒸馏方法中的质量-多样性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的少步扩散或流模型蒸馏方法存在格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡。π-Flow旨在通过策略预测机制来解决这一问题。

Method: π-Flow修改学生流模型的输出层，使其预测一个网络无关的策略。该策略在未来的子步骤中产生动态流速度，无需额外网络评估即可实现快速ODE积分。采用模仿蒸馏方法，通过ℓ2流匹配损失将策略的速度与教师模型的速度对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上，π-Flow在1-NFE时达到FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow。在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFEs时实现了比现有少步方法更好的多样性，同时保持教师级别的质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单的模仿教师行为，实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

*Ho Yin Au,Jie Chen,Junkun Jiang,Jingyu Xiang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了Compositional Phase Diffusion框架，通过语义相位扩散模块和过渡相位扩散模块解决多语义运动序列生成中的过渡不连续问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成模型在创建包含多个语义运动片段的复合序列时，难以保持运动动力学在片段过渡边界处的连续性，导致尴尬的过渡和突然的伪影

Method: 利用预训练的动作中心运动相位自编码器建立的潜在运动频率域，通过SPDM和TPDM模块在扩散过程中逐步融入相邻运动片段的语义指导和相位细节

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成语义对齐的复合运动序列方面具有竞争力，同时保持前后运动片段之间的相位过渡连续性

Conclusion: 该框架通过固定输入运动序列的相位参数，还可实现运动中间帧生成任务，展示了扩展到各种应用场景的潜力

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are
available at https://github.com/asdryau/TransPhase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人-类人机器人协作在医疗、家庭服务和制造领域具有巨大潜力，但类人机器人复杂的全身动力学使得实现顺从协作仍然是一个未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 使用仅本体感觉的强化学习方法，在闭环环境中训练单一策略模型，结合领导者和跟随者行为，通过协调轨迹规划来预测物体运动模式和人类意图。

Result: 模拟实验显示模型减少人类努力24.7%，真实世界实验验证了在不同物体类型和运动模式下的鲁棒性，用户研究显示比基线模型平均提升27.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际部署提供了一种无需外部传感器或复杂交互模型的实用解决方案，实现了高效的人-类人机器人顺从协作搬运。

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: GOPLA是一个分层框架，通过学习增强的人类演示来实现可泛化的物体放置任务，结合语义偏好和几何可行性推理，在真实世界机器人放置场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要帮助人类完成日常家务组织，其中物体放置任务需要同时考虑语义偏好（如常识性物体关系）和几何可行性（如碰撞避免）。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型将人类指令和视觉输入转换为结构化计划，空间映射器生成具有几何常识的3D功能图，基于扩散的规划器考虑多计划分布和碰撞避免来生成放置姿态，并通过可扩展管道扩展人类演示数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法比第二名方法提高了30.04个百分点的放置成功率，在定位精度和物理合理性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: GOPLA框架在广泛的真实世界机器人放置场景中展现出强大的泛化能力，为解决物体放置任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

TL;DR: RoboGhost是一个无需重定向的框架，直接通过语言引导的运动潜在变量来控制人形机器人，绕过传统多阶段流程中的运动解码和重定向步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的人形机器人运动管道存在多阶段处理导致的累积误差、高延迟和语义与控制耦合弱的问题，需要更直接的语言到动作路径。

Method: 采用基于扩散的策略，直接从噪声中解噪可执行动作，使用混合因果transformer-diffusion运动生成器确保长时程一致性和稳定性。

Result: 实验表明RoboGhost显著降低部署延迟，提高成功率和跟踪精度，在真实人形机器人上产生平滑且语义对齐的运动。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉-语言-动作人形系统提供了通用基础，可扩展到图像、音频和音乐等其他模态。

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

Motivation: 现有分层视觉语言动作框架中，VLM规划器需要人工标注或启发式规则来分解任务，但启发式子任务可能与底层视觉运动策略的训练数据存在显著偏差，从而降低任务性能

Method: RDD方法通过将分解后的子任务区间的视觉特征与底层视觉运动策略训练数据的视觉特征进行对齐，自动将演示分解为子任务

Result: 在仿真和真实世界任务上均优于最先进的子任务分解器，展示了在不同设置下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: RDD方法有效解决了子任务分解中的视觉特征对齐问题，提高了分层视觉语言动作框架的任务性能

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时检测人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型虚假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的假内容检测方法通常只针对单一类型（人工虚假信息或AI生成内容），但在真实场景中虚假内容的类型通常是未知的，这限制了专门化系统的有效性。

Method: 提出了UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器来捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因链式思维机制来定位显著的欺骗信号。

Result: 在包含127K样本的OmniFake数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门化的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: AI4Service范式为主动式AI助手提供了可行框架，未来AI应从被动工具转变为主动伙伴

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Result: 当前开源的大语言模型在组合式机器设计任务中表现不佳，特别是在空间推理和战略组装方面存在明显短板。

Conclusion: 组合式机器设计任务揭示了LLMs在语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域的挑战，强化学习可能是改进模型性能的有效途径，但仍面临诸多未解决的问题。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains
difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and
limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent
framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist
vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool
$\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The
system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly
using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool
expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by
existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling
self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation
benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new
datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models.
It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative
text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting
performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust,

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at

Motivation: 乳腺X线摄影在致密乳腺组织中的灵敏度较低，导致漏诊或延迟诊断。研究旨在利用热成像技术提供的功能信息来补充乳腺X线摄影的结构信息，克服单一模态筛查的局限性。

Method: 324名女性同时接受乳腺X线摄影和热成像检查。研究开发了一个多模态AI框架，根据乳腺组织密度动态选择最佳成像模态：对脂肪型乳腺使用乳腺X线摄影AI，对致密型乳腺使用Thermalytix热成像AI。

Result: 多模态AI框架的灵敏度达到94.55%，特异性为79.93%，优于单独的乳腺X线摄影AI（灵敏度81.82%，特异性86.25%）和Thermalytix AI（灵敏度92.73%，特异性75.46%）。在致密乳腺中，乳腺X线摄影的灵敏度显著下降至67.86%，而热成像技术保持稳定的高灵敏度（92.59%）。

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
(sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
(92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
high-resource and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序任务中的表现，发现SFT在权重方案上显著优于CL，因此在LLM重排序中具有一致优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器上对比学习更有效，但LLM上分类式SFT似乎更有前景，这种差异引发了对哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的深入研究

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过统一框架分析CL和SFT的交互，在UMR实验平台上进行综合比较和探针实验

Result: SFT提供比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显赢家，SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，在MRB基准上创造了新的SOTA结果

Conclusion: SFT优于CL适用于LLM重排序，研究结果为该领域未来研究和应用提供了有益指导

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

TL;DR: 多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时存在显著性能下降，本研究构建了包含6种英语方言的大规模基准测试，并提出了一种编码器优化方法，能在保持标准英语性能的同时显著提升方言处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有研究很少关注多模态生成模型能否有效处理方言文本输入。

Method: 构建包含4200多个方言提示词的大规模基准测试，评估17个图像和视频生成模型。提出基于编码器的优化方法，教导模型识别新方言特征同时保持标准英语性能。

Result: 当前最先进模型在单个方言词输入时性能下降32.26%-48.17%。提出的方法能将5种方言性能提升至标准英语水平(+34.4%)，且对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言时存在严重性能问题，但通过专门的编码器优化方法可以有效解决这一问题，实现方言与标准英语的平衡处理。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.
