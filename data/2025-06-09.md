### [1] [Can ChatGPT Perform Image Splicing Detection? A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05358)
*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域（特别是拼接检测）表现出色，零样本准确率超过85%，CoT提示策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4V在图像取证中的开箱即用能力，尤其是检测拼接操作。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集子集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: 零样本准确率超85%，CoT策略表现最均衡；模型能结合低级视觉特征和上下文知识。

Conclusion: GPT-4V虽不及专用模型，但其通用性、可解释性和推理能力使其成为图像取证的有力工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

*Taminul Islam,Toqi Tahamid Sarker,Mohamed G Embaby,Khaled R Ahmed,Amer AbuGhazaleh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CarboNeXT是一个用于光学气体成像（OGI）的语义分割框架，旨在检测和量化CO₂排放，适用于环境和畜牧业管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的关键指标，尤其在畜牧业管理中具有重要意义。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，有效建模气体羽流图像的局部细节和全局关系。

Result: 在CCR和RTA数据集上分别达到88.46%和92.95%的mIoU，实时性能为60.95 FPS。轻量级变体CarboFormer在资源受限平台上表现优异。

Conclusion: CarboNeXT和CarboFormer为CO₂排放分析提供了强大工具，特别适用于畜牧业和环境监测。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

### [3] [Scalable Generation of Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images via Whole-Slide Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05361)
*Tinglin Huang,Tianyu Liu,Mehrtash Babadi,Wengong Jin,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术结合了组织学成像和基因表达分析，但受限于低通量和实验设施需求。现有方法在预测ST时未考虑细胞间相互作用且内存效率低。

Method: STFlow采用流匹配生成模型，建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布，并引入高效的局部空间注意力编码器，实现全切片处理。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有基线，相对病理学基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过建模细胞间相互作用和高效编码器设计，显著提升了空间转录组学预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

### [4] [Seed Selection for Human-Oriented Image Reconstruction via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05363)
*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种种子选择方法，通过从多个候选种子中选择最优种子，在不增加比特率的情况下提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳，需要改进。

Method: 通过从多个候选种子中选择最优种子，并利用反向扩散过程的早期中间输出来降低计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的种子选择方法有效提升了图像质量，且未增加比特率。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

### [5] [Text2Stereo: Repurposing Stable Diffusion for Stereo Generation with Consistency Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05367)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的新方法，通过文本提示生成立体图像，利用Stable Diffusion的先验知识并微调，结合提示对齐和立体一致性奖励函数提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大基线立体图像数据集稀缺，从头训练扩散模型不可行，因此利用现有模型进行微调。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion的先验知识，在立体图像数据集上微调，并通过提示对齐和立体一致性奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成高质量立体图像方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过微调和优化策略，成功实现了高质量的立体图像生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了创新数字文化遗产的访问方式，并探索数字图像的可塑性和当代解读。

Result: 实现了从艺术品自动生成动画视频，其中主要角色会解释其内容。

Conclusion: 该研究探讨了大语言模型中的文化偏见、数字图像和艺术品深度伪造的教育潜力，以及艺术史领域对此类创新的关注。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Existing automated VD efforts are hindered by the limited availability of
diverse, well-annotated databases. Existing databases suffer from coarse
video-level annotations, limited scale and diversity, and lack of metadata,
restricting the generalization of models. To address these challenges, we
introduce DVD, a large-scale (500 videos, 2.7M frames), frame-level annotated
VD database with diverse environments, varying lighting conditions, multiple
camera sources, complex social interactions, and rich metadata. DVD is designed
to capture the complexities of real-world violent events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态系统中，准确的状态估计对策略设计至关重要，但获取真实状态往往不可行，因此需要一种有效的方法从观测数据中学习状态表示。

Method: 结合CNN提取空间特征和GRU建模时间动态，构建状态表示，并利用DQN训练强化学习代理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能实时准确估计状态并实现控制，无需真实状态数据。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了状态估计问题，并通过定量评估验证了其对策略性能和稳定性的积极影响。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic
systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or
infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a
novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated
recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences
of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are
used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,
accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy
performance and control stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于InceptionResNetV2的判别网络，用于检测GAN生成的伪造图像和视频，并开发了一个平台帮助用户识别伪造内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上虚假图像和视频的快速传播是一个新兴问题，这些伪造内容可能被用于隐藏犯罪证据，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用基于InceptionResNetV2的卷积神经网络构建判别网络，并开发了一个检测平台。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效识别GAN生成的伪造图像和视频。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于法医领域检测伪造视频和隐藏的犯罪证据，从而识别犯罪活动。

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

### [12] [Can Vision Transformers with ResNet's Global Features Fairly Authenticate Demographic Faces?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05383)
*Abu Sufian,Marco Leo,Cosimo Distante,Anirudha Ghosh,Debaditya Barman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了Vision Transformer (ViT)和ResNet在生物特征人脸认证中的公平性和泛化能力，提出了一种结合全局和局部特征的少样本原型网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物特征人脸认证在不同人口统计群体中的公平性和泛化性问题。

Method: 结合预训练的ViT和ResNet特征，设计少样本原型网络，并在自定义数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer在任务中表现最佳，性能随支持集大小增加而提升。

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性和泛化性上表现良好，为生物特征认证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架Q-Ponder，用于同时优化视觉质量评估的评分准确性和解释性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述视为独立任务，导致评分准确性和解释性之间的权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的潜力。

Method: 采用冷启动阶段和基于强化学习的微调阶段，通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏高质量数据，并使用GRPO联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%，并在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架成功解决了评分与解释性的权衡问题，展示了在多任务上的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

*Mert Can Cakmak,Nitin Agarwal,Diwash Poudel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriPSS是一种新型三模态框架，通过融合颜色特征、深度结构嵌入和语义上下文，实现高效关键帧提取，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频关键帧提取在视频摘要和检索中至关重要，但现有方法难以全面捕捉视频内容的丰富性。

Method: TriPSS整合CIELAB颜色特征、ResNet-50深度结构嵌入和Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct生成的语义上下文，通过PCA融合模态，并使用HDBSCAN聚类自适应分割视频内容。

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS性能优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最新水平。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过捕捉视觉和语义的细微信息，为大规模视频内容理解设定了新基准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

### [15] [Talk2SAM: Text-Guided Semantic Enhancement for Complex-Shaped Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05396)
*Luka Vetoshkin,Dmitry Yudin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2SAM通过结合文本指导改进复杂形状物体的分割，显著提升了SAM-HQ的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在分割复杂形状物体（如细长结构或精细边界）时表现不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP嵌入的文本提示生成语义区域，并将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ提升了5.9% IoU和8.3%边界IoU。

Conclusion: 自然语言指导为精确分割提供了灵活有效的方法，尤其在传统提示方法失败的情况下。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的高延迟和计算开销限制了其在实时场景中的应用，尤其是存在过度推理的问题。

Method: 提出AD-EE框架，结合自动驾驶领域特性，利用因果推理确定最优退出层。

Result: 在Waymo和CODA数据集及实际车辆上验证，延迟降低最高57.58%，检测精度提升最高44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE有效解决了视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的效率问题，显著提升了实时性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Method: 构建了一个针对科学工作流程中过程异常检测的视觉基准，并在两种代表性的视觉语言模型上进行实验。

Conclusion: 本研究为科学实验工作流程中的视觉异常检测提供了数据驱动的基础和评估框架。

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS是一种新的视觉预训练方法，通过对象级自蒸馏提升图像和补丁级别的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设图像仅含单个对象，限制了在复杂场景数据集上的扩展性。ODIS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力，将自蒸馏粒度从图像级转移到对象级。

Result: 在ViT-Large上，ODIS在ImageNet1k上达到82.6%的k-NN准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏有效提升了视觉表示能力，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 大多数视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中表现不佳，仅少数表现优于随机猜测，而人类表现接近完美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视线推断能力在自然人类-AI交互中的重要性，并评估VLMs在此任务上的表现。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和场景下的表现，使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不优于随机猜测，人类表现接近完美；少数表现较好的VLMs受任务难度影响，但对感知变化稳健。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏自然视线推断能力，但仍有潜力成为与人类自然交互的技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态3D场景中空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY是一种无需训练的两阶段推理方法，显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，而3D动态环境中的空间推理尚未充分探索。

Method: SAVVY采用两阶段方法：1) 利用AV-LLMs和其他视听方法跟踪关键对象轨迹；2) 构建全局动态地图并通过坐标转换回答问题。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理的空白，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核读取，限制了其在大型学习管道中的使用，尤其是在计算集群上部署时的高许可成本。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式和开源库，支持查询和处理STEP文件，并提供采样、法线和曲率等标准功能。

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和与原STEP文件的兼容性。

Conclusion: 新格式有效解决了STEP格式的限制，便于在机器学习管道中广泛使用。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Motivation: 解决视觉强化学习中图像观察包含干扰元素（如阴影、云、光）时，任务相关特征提取的效率和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 设计自预测动态（SPD）方法，利用弱增强和强增强并行学习，通过预测双向增强版本间的逆向和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察中优于先前研究，并显著提升未见观察的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法能有效提取任务相关特征，提升视觉强化学习在复杂和未见观察中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Motivation: 解决MBRL算法在面对视觉干扰时性能下降的问题，适用于现实场景中的任务无关干扰。

Method: 使用双对比学习训练编码器和世界模型，引入递归状态逆动力学模型以更好地理解时间结构。

Result: 在DeepMind Control suite和Robosuite中，Dr. G分别比现有方法性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提高了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原始RF信号的高效轻量级单阶段MPPE模型，通过子分组和共享单层CNN结合多头注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF-based MPPE方法要么预处理复杂耗时，要么直接处理原始信号导致精度低。

Method: 子分组RF信号，使用共享单层CNN和多头注意力机制嵌入，并提出新的自监督学习方法。

Result: PCKh@0.5指标提升15%，新自监督方法在复杂场景下表现更优。

Conclusion: 模型高效轻量，性能显著优于现有方法，尤其在多人场景和复杂环境下表现突出。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了挑战，需要新的评估工具来推动研究。

Method: 通过2,792个视频片段和8,792个问题-答案对，结合人类与LLM协作的流程，构建了SIV-Bench数据集。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并确认了转录对话在理解复杂社交互动中的重要性。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Result: 该方法优于其他多模态和单模态攻击，能有效破坏多种先进预训练模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的协调攻击策略在多模态攻击中表现优越，揭示了现有模型的脆弱性。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频分类模型鲁棒性评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉特征提供语义信息，语言解码器在视觉特征不足时可补偿并恢复性能。

Conclusion: 未来架构可考虑将更多视觉处理任务分配给语言解码器，以优化动态分工。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Conclusion: 新方法为VLM评估提供了更精细和系统的诊断工具。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶应用中存在冗余和计算成本高的问题，需要更高效的结构化解决方案。

Method: 引入结构化数据集NuScenes-S和紧凑型视觉语言模型FastDrive（0.9B参数），专注于机器友好的描述和高效推理。

Result: FastDrive在结构化数据集上表现优异，决策任务准确率提升20%，推理速度提升10倍以上。

Conclusion: 结构化数据集和紧凑模型显著提升了自动驾驶决策任务的性能和效率，场景注释对决策任务有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance

Motivation: SAR图像分割在遥感应用中至关重要，但深度学习模型常因数据复杂统计分布而面临收敛速度和稳定性问题。

Method: 在U-Net和SegNet中集成模式归一化，以减少收敛时间并保持基线模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，模式归一化显著加速收敛，且归一化模型在不同区域表现出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: 归一化有效提高了SAR图像分割的计算效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法为现实图像增强任务提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的发展，图像编辑质量提升但滥用风险增加，需要可靠的方法识别图像中的修改区域。

Method: RADAR基于现有基础模型，结合多种图像模态特征，并引入辅助对比损失以隔离被修改的图像块。

Result: RADAR在BBC-PAIR基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法，能检测和定位已知和未知扩散模型的编辑。

Conclusion: RADAR通过多模态特征和对比损失，显著提升了图像编辑检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

TL;DR: S2GO提出了一种基于稀疏查询的3D表示方法，通过动态传播查询和解码为语义高斯分布，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示，速度慢且难以捕捉动态场景。

Method: 使用稀疏查询表示场景，动态传播查询并解码为语义高斯分布，结合去噪渲染目标优化。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中达到SOTA，IoU提升1.5，推理速度提升5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询方法在性能和效率上优于密集表示，适用于动态场景。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法通常针对固定放大因子训练，无法处理超出训练范围的尺度或退化问题。

Method: 采用分层时空纹理编码框架和多分辨率隐式哈希编码，实现自适应解码。

Result: 在未见尺度和噪声下保持高质量重建，在清晰度、细节保留和去噪效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VR-INR展示了隐式神经表示在视频修复中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构有效解决了SIRR问题，验证了其创新设计的有效性。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: FocusDiff有效解决了细粒度对齐问题，提升了文本到图像生成的精确控制。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

TL;DR: MORSE-500是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在解决现有多模态推理基准在时间动态、多样化推理能力和可扩展性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理基准主要依赖静态图像，缺乏对时间动态的捕捉，且过于侧重数学问题解决，忽视了其他推理能力。此外，现有基准容易饱和，难以持续评估模型进步。

Method: 通过500个脚本生成的视频片段，涵盖六类推理任务，使用Python脚本、生成视频模型和真实素材，实现视觉复杂度、干扰物密度和时间动态的可控生成。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3）在所有推理类别中表现不佳，尤其在抽象和规划任务上差距显著。

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展、透明的基准，支持未来多模态推理研究的持续评估和改进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户反馈调整和拆分原型部分（视觉概念），使其更符合用户偏好。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证，YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP通过交互式个性化显著提升了概念解释的可理解性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

Result: 在六个密集预测任务和七个数据集上，FRAME表现优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型。

Conclusion: FRAME是一种高效且通用的视频编码器，适用于多种下游应用。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Motivation: 当前3D视觉技术主要适用于静态场景，但在动态现象（如移动物体分割）中表现不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Layered Motion Fusion方法，将2D运动分割预测融合到分层辐射场中，并通过测试时细化降低数据复杂度。

Result: 3D模型的分割效果显著优于2D基线，证明了3D技术即使在动态场景中也能增强2D分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明，3D技术可以通过特定方法有效提升动态场景的分割性能，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理视觉模糊或无语义的场景文本时容易产生语义幻觉，即生成视觉错误但语义合理的答案。

Method: 通过ZoomText（粗到细的文本区域识别策略）和Grounded Layer Correction（利用不易产生幻觉的层表示来指导解码）缓解语义幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效缓解了语义幻觉，并在场景文本识别和理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在不训练的情况下显著减少语义幻觉，同时保持对有意义文本的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Conclusion: EX-4D实现了实用的4D视频生成。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成单一3D形状，要么采用两阶段流程（先分割图像再重建每个部分），PartCrafter旨在通过统一的组合生成架构实现端到端的部分感知生成。

Method: PartCrafter基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入组合潜在空间和分层注意力机制，支持多部分同时去噪生成。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解3D网格方面优于现有方法，包括不可见部分的生成。

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部分感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像恢复面临多种退化问题，现有方法难以泛化到野外数据，因此需要一种能够处理复杂退化（即多种已知退化的任意混合）的方法。

Method: 提出UniRes框架，结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，利用孤立训练数据，以端到端方式处理复杂退化。

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上评估，实验结果显示性能显著提升，尤其是对复杂退化图像。

Conclusion: UniRes通过灵活结合多个模型，有效解决了复杂退化问题，为野外图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Motivation: 现实世界中的图像超分辨率（Real-SR）由于低分辨率图像的复杂退化模式而具有挑战性。本文旨在通过多任务学习框架，解决任务不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的任务定义框架，通过参数特定边界分割退化空间；开发了基于焦点损失的多任务权重机制；并通过数据重平衡策略优化训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有退化任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过任务定义、不平衡量化和自适应数据重平衡的协调改进，显著提升了Real-SR的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的先验知识可扩展开放世界视觉理解，验证了迭代视觉基础框架的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和法线引导优化，显著提升了航空图像的三维重建效果。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Conclusion: TissUnet能快速、准确、可重复地分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Motivation: 为了解决在计算机视觉应用中多边形近似评估的问题，研究者们尝试比较不同度量标准，但Rosin度量计算耗时，导致加权图形优度被广泛使用。本文旨在探讨这两种度量是否可以互相替代。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计分析（包括Pearson相关系数）来研究加权图形优度与Rosin度量的关系。

Result: 理论证明和实验结果表明，这两种度量在数学和统计上均无关联。

Conclusion: 加权图形优度不能替代Rosin度量，因为它们在评估多边形近似时得出的结论不一致。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking
sequence. To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an
LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is
independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of
intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite
training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple
trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual

### [62] [Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765)
*Taiga Shinozaki,Tomoki Doi,Satoshi Nishida,Hitomi Yanaka*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否像人类一样容易受到视觉错觉的影响，并提出了一个区分真实和虚假错觉的VQA数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有研究中未区分实际和表观特征的局限性，以更准确地评估机器的认知能力。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含真实和虚假错觉的VQA数据集，并评估LVLMs在这些任务中的表现。

Result: 结果显示，LVLMs可能基于先验知识而非真实视觉理解来回答问题。

Conclusion: 结论是LVLMs对视觉错觉的反应可能缺乏真正的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决传感器数据延迟问题的新方法，通过时间戳偏移和数据增强策略，提升了自动驾驶感知系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器数据的不同步会导致物体状态估计不一致，影响轨迹预测的准确性，从而威胁自动驾驶的安全性。

Method: 采用每点时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略，模拟真实传感器延迟情况，并集成到多传感器检测模型中。

Result: 在传感器数据同步和延迟情况下，新方法均表现稳定，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传感器延迟问题，提升了自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D医学影像中，准确提取和表示血管结构对临床诊断至关重要。传统方法依赖离散表示（如掩码），容易因像素分类的局限性导致局部断裂或碎片化。

Method: DeformCL通过可变形中心线点作为节点，并通过边捕捉空间关系，实现了连续表示。该方法具有自然连通性、噪声鲁棒性和交互便利性。

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上的实验表明，DeformCL在效果和性能上优于传统方法。可视化结果验证了其临床意义。

Conclusion: DeformCL为3D血管分割提供了一种更优的连续表示方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型多尺度特征融合方法，将UNet解码过程重新构想为初始值问题，解决了传统跳跃连接的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UNet的跳跃连接缺乏多尺度特征的有效交互，且依赖简单的拼接或加法操作，限制了信息整合效率。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提高了特征利用率并减少了网络参数。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种类UNet网络，性能优越且代码开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Result: DIF滤波器吞吐量高达403.39 MEPS（1280x720）和428.45 MEPS（640x480），AUROC指数为0.844-0.999。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在噪声处理和高吞吐量方面优于现有解决方案，适用于广泛噪声水平。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

TL;DR: FontAdapter是一个快速生成未见字体视觉文本的框架，通过两阶段课程学习实现高效定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应未见字体时计算成本高，无法实时定制，FontAdapter旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先学习从孤立字形提取字体属性，再将其融入自然背景。

Result: 实验表明，FontAdapter能在无需额外微调的情况下，高质量地适应未见字体。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个多功能框架，支持视觉文本编辑、字体风格混合和跨语言字体转移。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object

Method: ChronoTailor采用区域感知的空间引导和注意力驱动的时序特征融合机制，结合多尺度服装特征和姿态对齐，确保时空连续性和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在时空连续性和细节保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的时空注意力机制和特征融合，为视频虚拟试穿提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Motivation: 传统皮肤点刺测试（SPT）依赖单一光照图像，结果一致性不足。SPAT设备旨在通过多光照图像提高测试的准确性和一致性。

Method: 研究使用868名患者的SPAT数据，手动标注10,416个风团，设计了一个结合神经网络分割和算法检测的自动化方法。

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，多光照条件下的32张图像比单一光照图像显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: SPAT设备的多光照图像方法优于传统单一光照图像，为过敏测试提供了更高准确性。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，CryoFastAR实现了与传统方法相当的质量，同时显著加速推理。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为Cryo-EM中的快速初始重建提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM) 是一个端到端驾驶框架，采用认知启发的快慢架构，通过选择性提示和多阶段推理流程提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合视觉语言模型和认知架构，提高自动驾驶系统的高层意图生成能力，同时保持低延迟。

Method: 引入选择性五视图提示、多阶段链式思维提示和基于样条的轨迹后处理，优化驾驶决策和轨迹生成。

Conclusion: HMVLM通过认知架构和提示优化，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSCL的新方法，通过捕捉细粒度的上下文和语义一致性来增强多模态媒体篡改检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度一致性探索不足，导致篡改细节感知不充分和结果不可靠。

Method: 建立了图像和文本模态的两个分支，每个分支包含两个级联解码器（CCD和SCD），分别捕捉模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上，CSCL取得了最先进的性能，尤其在定位篡改内容方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习有效提升了多模态篡改检测和定位能力。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Mask2Former模型，结合可变形注意力和偏移调整策略，用于医学图像分割，尤其在小和中型器官上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如ViT）在小和中型器官上表现不佳，DSC低于50%，远低于临床可接受的80%。

Method: 使用Mask2Former结合可变形注意力以减少计算量，提出偏移调整策略以优化采样点位置，并利用第4层特征图和FCN辅助头加速训练。

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在小和中型器官上表现突出。

Conclusion: 改进的Mask2Former模型显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，尤其是在小和中型器官上，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

### [80] [Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917)
*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，用于全面衡量半监督语义分割模型的准确性、可靠性和鲁棒性，并呼吁改变现有评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督分割模型的评估仅关注分割准确性，忽视了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过谐波平均结合预测准确性、校准和不确定性质量度量。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常以牺牲可靠性为代价换取准确性，UniMatchV2在域外评估中表现鲁棒但仍存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用RSS等更全面的评估指标，以使半监督学习研究更符合实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: FADE是一种无需训练的高效视频编辑方法，通过频率感知分解利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，实现高质量、时间一致的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在高效编辑方面存在计算量大、难以直接应用图像编辑技术的局限性，FADE旨在克服这些问题。

Method: 通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，提出分解策略优化各组件角色，并结合频谱引导调制细化采样轨迹。

Result: 在真实视频上的实验表明，FADE能产生高质量、真实且时间一致的编辑结果。

Conclusion: FADE通过频率感知分解和频谱调制，显著提升了视频编辑的效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

TL;DR: MOGO是一个高效的实时3D运动生成框架，通过MoSA-VQ和RQHC-Transformer实现高质量、低延迟的运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在同时实现高保真、流式生成、实时响应和可扩展性方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出MOGO框架，包含MoSA-VQ（自适应残差向量量化模块）和RQHC-Transformer（残量化层次因果Transformer）。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在实时性能和零样本泛化方面。

Conclusion: MOGO在运动生成质量和效率上取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或3D高斯泼溅的SLAM方法在动态环境中表现不佳，尤其是仅依赖RGB输入时。

Method: 提出融合光流掩码和深度掩码的概率模型，设计运动损失约束姿态估计网络，并使用渲染损失消除动态干扰。

Result: 实验表明，Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了最先进的跟踪和渲染性能，优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景的SLAM提供了一种高效且仅需RGB输入的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了全面的框架，指出了当前研究空白，并支持DA方法在农业图像分析中的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案多样但缺乏统一的评估基准，无法全面评估其安全性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型骨干，为每种CAPTCHA类型微调专门的破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: MCA-Bench揭示了现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞谱，并首次定量分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 提出了三个可操作的设计原则和关键开放挑战，为CAPTCHA加固、公平基准测试和社区合作奠定了基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Motivation: 探索视觉与语言基础模型是否具备现实世界模型和动态模型的能力，并研究如何通过动态模型引导世界模型的构建。

Method: 通过监督学习训练动态模型，并利用两种策略（弱监督学习和推理时间验证）来引导世界模型的构建。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，优于现有模型15%（基于GPT4o评估），并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以通过监督学习获得，并有效引导世界模型的构建，从而提升模型在动作中心任务中的表现。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SSNI的新框架，通过样本特定的噪声注入优化DBP方法，显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DBP方法对所有样本使用固定的噪声水平$t^*$，而研究发现不同样本的最优$t^*$可能不同。

Method: SSNI利用预训练的评分网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度，并基于评分范数自适应调整$t^*$。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上，SSNI显著提升了DBP方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 样本特定的噪声注入是DBP方法的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Result: HAVIR在复杂场景中能有效重建视觉刺激的结构和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR通过多模态信息融合，显著提升了从脑活动重建复杂视觉刺激的能力。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于“角树”的新型张量到张量层（FIS），具有线性计算成本，适用于图像和高阶张量数据处理，在分类和异常检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习应用中，图像和高阶张量数据的高维度需要子二次计算成本的层，而现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 利用“角树”数学工具，提出了一种线性成本的张量到张量层（FIS），并推广了迭代积分（或和）的签名。

Result: 在分类任务中，FIS层替换部分ResNet层后，性能接近更大模型（差异仅0.1%），同时减少参数和计算量；在异常检测任务中，AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理工具，适用于多种任务，并能与其他层无缝集成。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种浅层-深层协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，提升红外小目标检测的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽视了浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，影响检测性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别建模结构特征和语义特征，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂度和高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net在红外小目标检测中展现出优越性能和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中表现出强大的判别潜力，但其可靠性问题尚未得到充分研究。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了全适应共形预测框架（full conformal adaptation），并结合SS-Text（一种无需训练的线性探针求解器），以提升模型的适应性和计算效率。

Result: 在9个适应任务中，该框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，将集合效率提升了高达27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中的可靠应用提供了一种高效且理论保证的方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展。现有视觉语言模型缺乏领域知识，导致量化与推理能力不足。

Method: WisWheat包含三个层次的数据集：基础预训练数据集、定量数据集和指令微调数据集，用于增强模型在小麦形态、性状测量及病虫害诊断中的能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于WisWheat微调的模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中表现优异，准确率分别达到79.2%和84.6%，超越通用商业模型。

Conclusion: WisWheat显著提升了视觉语言模型在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

TL;DR: FBG（FeedBack Guidance）通过动态调整引导量，解决了CFG（Classifier-Free Guidance）在条件扩散模型中可能导致多样性和记忆化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在条件扩散模型中虽然提高了样本保真度，但固定的引导量可能导致多样性和记忆化问题。FBG旨在通过状态依赖的系数动态调整引导量。

Method: FBG假设条件分布被无条件分布线性污染，通过反馈预测的置信度动态调整引导量，而非固定值。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上，FBG显著优于CFG，并与LIG竞争；在文本到图像生成中，FBG能自动根据提示复杂度调整引导量。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种数学框架支持的动态引导方法，优于固定引导策略，并能与其他引导方案结合。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1是一种新型长视频代理范式，通过链式镜头推理逐步选择相关镜头，实现高效的长视频理解，性能优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中常因忽略镜头结构而引入冗余或噪声信息，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出链式镜头推理范式，逐步选择相关镜头并进行粗到细的分区多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准测试中表现最佳，如VideoMME（77.0）和EgoSchema（70.1），优于基线模型和闭源模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过模仿人类逐步思考过程，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

Motivation: 传统相机在极低光条件下动态范围有限，事件相机方法忽略全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续性。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包含事件特征增强模块和双向交叉注意力融合机制。

Result: PSNR提升0.96dB，LPIPS提升0.03，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决低光图像增强问题，提供新数据集RELIE支持研究。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Result: 在占用流指标上达到最先进水平，并在Waymo挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统将多模态视为独立源，导致检索效果不佳，需要动态选择最佳模态组合。

Method: CLaMR联合编码视频帧、语音、屏幕文本和元数据，通过多模态骨干网络和模态感知损失训练。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上，CLaMR显著优于单模态和多模态基线检索器。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频检索中表现优异，尤其在长视频问答任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和粮食安全监测至关重要，但目前缺乏结合高光谱和多时相数据的研究。

Method: 采用双流Transformer架构，分别处理高光谱数据的空间-光谱特征和多时相数据的时序特征，并通过层次分类头进行融合。

Conclusion: 该方法在作物分类任务中优于现有深度学习方法，且高光谱数据在不同时间窗口和作物变化场景中均表现出稳定优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large

HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that

learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该工作为心理图像检索任务提供了新方法、数据集和基础，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在内窥镜任务中的表现，发现其在基础感知任务中表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务中表现不佳，且专业医学VLMs目前不如通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉模型在内窥镜领域泛化能力不足，而基础模型显示出跨域潜力，因此研究VLMs在内窥镜任务中的表现。

Method: 使用多种先进VLMs、多个手术数据集和人工标注，评估其在基础感知任务和高级场景理解任务中的表现，并比较专业医学VLMs与通用模型。

Result: VLMs在基础任务（如物体计数和定位）中表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务中表现显著下降；专业医学VLMs目前不如通用模型。

Conclusion: VLMs在内窥镜任务中仍有改进空间，尤其是专业医学VLMs需优化以适应手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Motivation: 解决PyTorch数据加载器在从云存储直接流式传输GeoTIFF文件时无法充分利用现代GPU的问题。

Method: 通过系统测试不同加载配置和数据参数，使用贝叶斯优化找到每种存储类型的最优设置。

Result: 优化的配置使远程数据加载吞吐量提升20倍，本地吞吐量提升4倍，GPU利用率达到85-95%。

Conclusion: 优化的远程加载配置在相同时间预算下达到与本地训练相同的精度，验证IoU提升6-15%。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中取得突破，但在视觉形式的变体中识别和推理同一概念的能力（即概念化）仍存在不足。

Method: 通过VGA数据集中的六个基于图的任务，测试AI系统在不同视觉形式下的推理能力。

Result: 人类在任务中表现近乎完美，而AI模型在异构检测上完全失败，路径/循环任务中表现有限，显示出伪智能模式匹配行为。

Conclusion: VGA揭示了当前AI模型在视觉理解上的根本局限性，为推进AI视觉模型的概念化能力提供了框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Conclusion: BecomingLit在重建和重光照头部化身方面表现出色，为交互式渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在长视频理解方面存在局限，现有基准测试多关注细节或依赖自动化生成的问题，无法反映真实理解。

Method: 引入MF$^2$基准，包含50多部电影和850多对手动构建的真实与虚假声明，测试模型对核心叙事元素的识别能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在识别关键叙事信息上远低于人类表现，突显其局限性。

Conclusion: MF$^2$为评估模型的长视频理解能力提供了新标准，揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Method: 提出TARFlow（Transformer Autoregressive Flow），结合深度-浅层设计、潜在空间建模和新型指导算法。

Result: 在类别条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: 首次证明归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性，为生成模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed

Result: 在七个基准测试中表现优于传统LVLM架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo通过改进架构和位置编码，显著提升了多模态处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

Conclusion: 低差异像素块策略在图像重建中表现优于随机选择，为自回归模型的应用提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

<details>

Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中效果不佳，因其缺乏有效的上下文信息关联方法，而胎儿超声图像具有低对比度、高相似性和高噪声的特点。

Method: 设计了位置注意力机制（DAN）模块和双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块，以增强特征表示并捕获不同尺度的上下文和全局特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别达到91.05%和100%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 实验证明了FPDANet的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

*Nadine Garibli,Mayank Patwari,Bence Csiba,Yi Wei,Kostas Sidiropoulos*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LinGuinE是一种自动化方法，用于分割肺部肿瘤的纵向CT扫描序列，显著提高了分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准传播初始肿瘤标记点，并使用点击有效性分类器选择有效点以生成新时间点的分割。

Result: 在两项测试数据集上，LinGuinE将Dice系数提高了20%以上（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在纵向肿瘤分割中表现出色，且可以从任意时间点开始，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

TL;DR: DermaCon-IN是一个包含5450多张临床图像的皮肤病数据集，旨在解决现有数据集中临床和人口统计多样性的不足，特别关注南印度门诊患者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未能捕捉真实世界临床实践的复杂性和多样性，特别是非西方人群的皮肤病分布和肤色变化。

Method: 数据集包含来自3000名患者的图像，由认证皮肤科医生标注240多种诊断，并采用基于病因的分类法。测试了多种模型架构。

Result: 通过多种模型（如ResNet、ViT等）建立了基线性能，探索了解剖和概念线索的整合。

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN为皮肤病AI提供了可扩展且具有代表性的基础，有助于开发更可解释和临床实用的模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型脉冲神经元（Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire），通过整数二进制泄漏积分发放和范围对齐策略，显著提升了脉冲神经网络的性能，同时仅略微增加能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在图像分类和目标检测等任务中表现不如人工神经网络（ANNs）的问题，提升其信息表达能力。

Method: 采用整数二进制泄漏积分发放（Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire）和范围对齐策略，扩展虚拟时间步长并解决高整数激活限制问题。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到74.19%准确率，在COCO上达到66.2% mAP@50和49.1% mAP@50:95，性能超越之前最佳SNNs，且能耗效率提升6.3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升了SNNs的性能，还使其在相同架构下达到或超越ANNs的表现，同时保持了高能效。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance
with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据归因方法，通过自适应参数重要性权重提高归因准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有网络参数同等对待，忽略了不同层编码不同类型信息的特点。

Method: 学习参数重要性权重，无需标记数据，自适应模型结构。

Result: 在扩散模型中提高了归因准确性，并能细粒度分析输出如何借鉴训练数据。

Conclusion: 新方法通过自适应权重优化了数据归因，提供了更细致的训练数据贡献分析。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Motivation: 传统AI开发以模型为中心，但研究发现数据质量对性能影响更大，因此提出数据为中心的新方法。

Result: DSD在特定模型上相比已知基准有定量改进，代码和训练模型已公开。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法能显著提升模型性能，DSD为高质量数据集设定了新标准。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Motivation: 多标签分类中大量负样本会干扰学习过程，传统方法处理负样本效果不佳。

Method: 重新设计损失函数，引入正则化参数控制负样本概率对整体似然的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集上F1、F2和平均精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新损失函数有效提升了多标签分类性能，无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索（NAS）中评估成本高，性能预测器通过直接估计架构性能来降低成本，但损失函数的选择对预测器效果影响显著，目前缺乏对其的深入研究。

Method: 将损失函数分为回归、排序和加权三类，评估了八种损失函数在13个任务和五个搜索空间中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，特定类别的损失函数组合可以显著提升预测器性能，并为不同任务选择损失函数提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 本研究为NAS社区提供了损失函数选择和组合的实用指南，并希望推动预测器方法的进一步发展。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）在区分可靠与不可靠预测时表现不佳，主要由于分类器权重噪声的影响。

Method: 提出了一种测试时优化方法，通过定义单调子集选择函数来优化置信度估计。

Result: 在AUSE和AURC等标准风险指标上表现优异，并能有效识别训练与测试分布差异及区分分布内外样本。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，还揭示了CNN与ViT分类器在不同视觉数据集上的关键差异。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，不同任务的梯度可能存在冲突，影响模型收敛。现有方法需要更有效的梯度调整策略。

Method: 提出SAM-GS方法，结合梯度均衡和一阶动量调制，利用梯度幅度相似性指导优化过程。

Result: 实验证明SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中有效。

Conclusion: 梯度幅度相似性在MTDL中能有效规范梯度聚合，优化学习过程。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Conclusion: SPEC为嵌入比较和对齐提供了可解释且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Conclusion: QualitEye为眼动分析提供了新方法，结合机器学习、人机交互和密码学。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Result: 可用性研究表明，应用具有优秀的用户体验和良好的AI识别效果。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医护人员之间的远程护理空白，并为类似数字健康工具提供了设计参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Motivation: 零样本目标导航在未知开放环境中因忽视高维隐式场景信息和长距离目标搜索任务而导致性能显著下降。

Method: 通过SBERT推理观察到的环境并利用Diffusion预测未观察到的环境，构建EAM；MHR模块基于EAM进行前沿探索决策，避免长距离场景中的迂回路径。

Result: EAM模块在MP3D数据集上达到64.5%的场景映射准确率；导航任务在HM3D和MP3D基准上的SPL分别为28.4%和26.3%，比基线方法分别提升了21.4%和46.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的EAM和MHR模块有效解决了零样本目标导航中的场景信息利用和路径效率问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

### [135] [Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)
*Yuan Xun,Siyuan Liang,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的防御框架Robust Instruction Tuning，通过两种正则化方法有效降低LVLMs在微调时的后门攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御技术通常针对单模态模型或需要训练时的监督知识，而实际场景中防御者无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数，也无法预知未知的触发模式或目标响应。

Method: 通过输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，仅微调解码器模块和文本嵌入层，避免模型记忆触发-响应的表面映射。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验表明，该方法将攻击成功率降至接近零，训练成本仅增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需核心权重或攻击先验的情况下，有效防御了LVLMs的后门攻击，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: QA-HFL是一个质量感知的分层联邦学习框架，针对资源受限的移动设备处理异构图像质量，通过质量加权融合和差分隐私保护，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动设备中图像质量异构性和资源限制问题，同时保障隐私。

Method: 训练针对不同图像质量的本地模型，使用质量加权融合机制聚合特征，并加入差分隐私保护。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，仅三轮联邦训练即达到92.31%准确率，优于FedRolex（86.42%）；在严格隐私约束下保持30.77%准确率。

Conclusion: QA-HFL通过设备特定正则化、自适应加权和知识蒸馏，有效提升性能并保持高效通信。

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current
models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future
research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

### [138] [ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05480)
*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS是一种新方法，结合3D高斯泼溅和潜在神经ODE，用于预测动态3D场景的未来状态，超越训练时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）在时间外推时表现不佳，ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ODE-GS通过冻结时间条件变形模型，训练Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹，并用神经ODE控制潜在状态演化。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，ODE-GS的PSNR提升高达10 dB，LPIPS减半。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景逼真预测的有效方法。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SurGSplat是一种通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅的新方法，用于解决内窥镜场景中稀疏特征和不一致光照导致的3D重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜场景中的稀疏特征和不一致光照使得现有的基于运动恢复结构（SfM）的方法效果不佳，容易导致重建失败。

Method: 提出SurGSplat，通过整合几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），实现血管结构等关键特征的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成（NVS）和姿态估计准确性上表现优异，为手术场景重建提供了高保真且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: SurGSplat通过增强视觉清晰度，帮助外科医生进行精确的术中决策，是一种适用于内窥镜场景的高效重建方法。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CL是一个新的多模态大语言模型持续学习基准，解决了现有方法和基准的局限性，通过参数隔离和路由机制有效减少灾难性干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在动态现实场景中持续集成新知识和技能的能力不足，且持续学习领域的基准和方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能最小化遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL为多模态持续学习提供了有效解决方案，适用于领域和能力持续学习。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.
