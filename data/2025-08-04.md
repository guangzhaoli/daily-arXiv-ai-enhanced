### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略提升全身生物识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法可能忽略个体模态分数分布的差异，难以提升最终性能。

Method: 使用专家混合（MoE）策略，引入伪质量损失和质量估计器（QE），以及分数三元组损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QME框架有效解决了多模态和多模型中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在跨上下文迁移高级运动概念时的表现，发现模型在新情境下性能显著下降，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高级运动概念到不同情境中，即使是在相似分布下。

Method: 引入了一个运动可迁移性框架，使用三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA）评估了13个先进模型。

Result: 模型在新情境下识别高级动作时性能显著下降，且多模态模型在细粒度动作上表现更差。

Conclusion: 研究为评估动作识别中的运动可迁移性提供了重要基准，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monado SLAM数据集解决了头戴式传感器在挑战性场景中的跟踪问题，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴式传感器的高强度运动、动态遮挡等场景中表现不佳，缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过多个虚拟现实头显采集真实序列，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 数据集以CC BY 4.0许可发布，推动VIO/SLAM研究发展。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了研究空白，有助于解决实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性，因此研究专注于眼周区域的性别分类。

Method: 使用CNN模型分析眼周区域的颜色图像，提取关键特征进行分类，并在两个数据集上验证性能。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%的准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%的准确率，参数较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 模型在性别分类中表现出色，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的统一评估指标，用于评估生成视频模型的内部世界一致性，整合了四个可解释的子组件，并通过学习权重公式生成一致性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，而忽略了视频中的时间和物理一致性。WCS 旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS 结合了四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），并通过开源工具计算。权重通过人类偏好数据训练得到。

Result: WCS 在多个基准测试中验证了其与人类评估的相关性，并与其他指标（如 FVD、CLIPScore）进行了比较。

Conclusion: WCS 提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在保持时间一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer是一种主动地理定位（AGL）代理，通过内在奖励驱动的好奇心探索，提高了在多样化环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在目标距离估计困难或遇到未见目标和环境时，探索策略的可靠性降低，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出GeoExplorer，利用好奇心驱动的内在奖励进行目标无关的探索，通过有效环境建模实现多样化和上下文相关的探索。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在定位陌生目标和环境时表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动的探索策略，显著提升了AGL任务中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据中的测量不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反光物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致准确性下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出了PPC，为每个点添加概率属性以表示测量不确定性，并设计了轻量级的推理方法，可作为模块集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际捕获数据验证，PPC在室内外场景中优于LiDAR和相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反光物体及强环境光时表现突出。

Conclusion: PPC通过保留测量不确定性信息，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMS方法通过扰动量化模型对多模态的依赖，发现VLMs在医学任务中过度依赖文本信息，忽视视觉线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在医学决策中可能存在的模态偏差，尤其是对文本信息的过度依赖。

Method: 提出选择性模态转移（SMS），通过交换样本的图像或文本来量化模型对模态的依赖。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在医学数据中显著依赖文本输入，视觉信息常被忽视。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型时需确保视觉和文本信息的真正融合，避免单一模态依赖。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于为机器学习和计算科学中的数学模型提供一种层次化的图结构表示方法，以支持高效的算法设计和模型架构定义。

Method: 方法包括定义层次化增长的图谱系，引入延长映射和距离度量，以及推导适用于分级图的低开销代数操作和类型构造器。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法适用于定义层次化模型架构（如深度神经网络和多网格数值方法），并支持局部采样和优化算法。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知模拟的自动真实人格识别方法，通过短音频-视觉行为模拟认知，并利用2D-GNN进行人格推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格偏差较大，性能较差。受真实人格与内部认知关联的启发，提出新方法。

Method: 模拟个性化内部认知，将其表示为网络权重，编码为二维图，并设计2D-GNN进行推断。采用端到端策略联合训练模块。

Result: 通过模拟认知和2D-GNN，提高了真实人格识别的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过模拟内部认知和2D图表示，有效提升了真实人格识别的准确性和性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx通过冻结CLIP文本嵌入作为语义指导，提出轻量级适配器Parallel-Text，提升SAM在语义分割中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义文本提示在分割任务中的潜力，弥补传统空间提示（如点和框）的不足。

Method: 设计轻量级适配器Parallel-Text，将文本嵌入注入SAM的图像编码器，仅修改MLP并行分支，保留注意力路径。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，固定文本嵌入显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成到SAM架构中，为高效适应提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入物体局部位置信息显著提升分类性能，且仅需少量标注或完全无监督方法即可实现大部分改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中因图像多物体或复杂背景导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model（仅需标注一个像素）或无监督前景物体提取方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息的引入是提升少样本分类性能的有效方法，且实现成本低。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度融合U形Mamba模型（MSF-UM），用于深度图超分辨率任务，结合了Mamba的高效状态空间建模能力和多尺度U形结构，显著提升了重建精度并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长距离依赖和全局上下文建模方面存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗较高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MSF-UM在减少模型参数的同时，显著提升了重建精度，并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型在深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色，为高效处理高分辨率深度图提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在初始化时间长和多视角一致性差的问题，PointGauss旨在高效解决3D分割任务。

Method: 结合点云高斯基元解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统，实现快速3D实例分割。

Result: 实验显示性能提升1.89%至31.78%，并保持高效计算。

Conclusion: PointGauss在多目标分割中表现优异，同时推出了新数据集DesktopObjects-360以弥补现有基准的不足。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Motivation: 现有方法在持续学习中更新视觉投影器时，可能导致模型过度关注视觉输入而忽视语言指令，尤其是在重复文本指令的任务中。

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景下性能显著下降，并探讨了提升鲁棒性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应在计算机视觉中至关重要，但其在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足，因此需要建立一个基准来评估和改进。

Method: 构建包含14种常见成像问题的数据集，评估现有方法和大规模视觉模型的性能，并测试鲁棒性增强策略。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下性能下降；大规模模型提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO模型优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更好；通用数据增强无效。

Conclusion: 语义对应在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性需进一步研究，任务特定的设计是提升鲁棒性的关键。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，统一理解不同动态对象的需求增强空间智能，同时准确估计动物姿态和形状对生物研究至关重要。但现有方法网络容量有限且缺乏多物种数据集。

Method: 提出AniMer+框架，采用家族感知的ViT和MoE设计，分区网络层为物种特定和共享组件。通过扩散模型生成合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像（含合成数据）上训练，方法在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，包括Animal Kingdom数据集。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了真实应用性能，解决了数据稀缺和网络容量问题。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用事件和帧模态的优势，限制了性能。论文通过分析各模态作用，提出两阶段增强流程。

Method: 1. 设计基于傅里叶空间幅度-相位纠缠的可见性恢复网络；2. 提出动态对齐融合策略以减少空间不匹配；3. 利用空间-频率插值生成负样本，开发对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦两阶段增强流程和引入动态对齐与对比损失，论文方法显著提升了低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for

complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架有效提升了视频异常检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在少样本微调时难以平衡目标分布对齐和原始模型知识保留，导致文本编辑能力下降或目标分布对齐不足。

Method: 利用未学习的弱模型和空文本提示，动态控制微调程度，通过权重插值实现平衡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 提出的个性化引导方法有效解决了微调中的平衡问题，适用于多种微调策略。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across

for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question

images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively

Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度引起的观测噪声和参考帧变化，导致高动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出了SG-LKF和MotionScaleNet（MSNet），结合自监督轨迹一致性损失，优化语义和位置约束。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT和3D MOT以及nuScenes 3D MOT上表现优异，HOTA和AMOTA指标显著提升。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

Conclusion: CoST通过统一时空聚合，显著提升了协作感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon是一种新颖的神经隐式重建方法，通过特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束，解决了稀疏视图重建中泛化性和几何细节不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏视图重建中表现不佳：泛化方法对未见视图泛化能力差，过拟合方法受限于几何线索不足。

Method: 提出SparseRecon，结合体积渲染特征一致性损失和不确定性引导深度约束，提升重建完整性和几何细节。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过双重约束机制，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

### [32] [Representation Shift: Unifying Token Compression with FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00367)
*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于测量每个token表示的变化程度，从而与FlashAttention无缝集成，实现有效的token压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型和token数量增多，导致自注意力的二次计算成本和GPU内存访问开销增加。现有的token压缩方法依赖于注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，无需训练或注意力图，直接测量token表示的变化程度，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。

Result: 在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中，实现了高达5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，包括Transformer、CNN和状态空间模型。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作。

Method: BiAnt结合前向和后向预测，利用大语言模型。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测有效提升长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无损检测方法难以检测细微或内部缺陷，且现有神经网络方法缺乏可解释性，存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 通过结合自适应框架和可解释性分析，本研究提升了焊接缺陷检测系统的信任度和可靠性，适用于海洋和离岸环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一个实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用SSMs的低频偏置特性捕捉形态学模式。在相同数据集上预训练并评估了五种不同架构。

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$在LOSO评估中相关性比最佳ViT高57%，性能下降减少43%，且在分类、检索和生存预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$作为下一代病理视觉基础模型骨干，展现出卓越性能和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因数据有限和模态异步性导致融合效果不佳，多智能体系统在有限数据下表现优异，因此提出Cued-Agent以解决这些问题。

Method: Cued-Agent包含四个子智能体：基于多模态大语言模型的手势识别、基于Transformer的唇部识别、动态整合手势提示的推理模块，以及通过语义细化实现音素到单词转换的自校正模块。

Result: 实验表明，Cued-Agent在正常和听力受损场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作和语义细化，显著提升了CS识别的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示调优（PT）中存在视觉和文本模态信息不对称的问题，导致模型偏向关注上下文区域，而非目标对象。

Method: DAPT框架首先解耦视觉模态为前景和背景表示，然后分别对齐文本模态，并引入视觉拉-推正则化以增强视觉注意力。

Result: DAPT在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦对齐和视觉正则化，有效解决了信息不对称问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Result: 在多种生成模型上的实验表明，该方法具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合空间-时间一致性特征，该方法能有效检测伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在高风险工业领域的性能尚未充分探索，需要专门测试其识别常规操作和安全关键异常的能力。

Method: 构建了包含1,100个工业场景视频片段的iSafetyBench数据集，标注了98种常规和67种危险动作类别，并设计了多标签评估问题。

Result: 在零样本条件下测试了8个先进模型，发现它们在识别危险活动和多标签场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: iSafetyBench揭示了现有模型的性能差距，推动了更鲁棒、安全感知的多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效抑制运动拖尾伪影、恢复边缘细节，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在强湍流和复杂动态场景中表现优异，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code

Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）的顺序去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了其在实时场景中的应用。现有方法忽略了去噪阶段和Transformer块中语义焦点的动态变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，通过排名残差演化动态确定重计算比例，选择性跳过冗余计算，并结合轻量级线性预测机制减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构中实现了超过2倍的推理加速，且输出质量下降最小。

Conclusion: Sortblock为加速基于扩散的生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Motivation: 潜在通道增加虽能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛慢，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练策略，优化潜在空间结构和加速收敛。

Result: 在ImageNet 512x512上，DC-AE 1.5比DC-AE生成质量更好且快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过技术创新显著提升了扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器和损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘的视觉质量和全局一致性。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Motivation: 水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和边界模糊）导致现有固定补丁扫描机制无法保持实例连续性，背景干扰也影响实例理解。

Method: 设计了动态树扫描（DTS）模块和隐藏状态削弱（HSW）模块，分别解决实例连续性和背景干扰问题。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最优性能，同时保持低参数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba成功将Mamba迁移至水下任务，为水下实例分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

*Seunggeun Chi,Enna Sachdeva,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中的人-物交互（HOI）遮挡补全，显著提升了生成结果的准确性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如预训练扩散模型）在动态HOI场景中难以生成合理的遮挡补全结果，因其对HOI理解有限。

Method: 利用人类拓扑和接触信息的物理约束，定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制化的多区域去噪策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了机器对动态环境的感知能力，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

*M. A. Pérez-Cutiño,J. Valverde,J. Capitán,J. M. Díaz-Báñez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AerialCSP虚拟数据集，用于预训练模型以减少标注需求，提升CSP工厂缺陷检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP工厂的无人机图像具有高反射性和领域特殊性，传统数据集难以适用，标注成本高。

Method: 创建AerialCSP合成数据集，模拟真实CSP工厂图像，用于预训练模型。

Result: 预训练显著提升真实缺陷检测效果，尤其是罕见和小缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP视觉任务提供高效解决方案，减少标注负担。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

TL;DR: TopoTTA是一个针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时适应框架，通过两阶段方法解决域偏移问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割对域偏移特别敏感，拓扑结构变化和局部特征差异会影响分割完整性，需要专门的方法来解决。

Method: TopoTTA分为两阶段：1）使用TopoMDC增强拓扑表示；2）通过TopoHG生成硬样本并利用伪标签对齐预测。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上，TopoTTA平均提升了31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是首个针对TSS的测试时适应框架，能有效处理拓扑分布偏移，且适用于CNN模型。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在边缘细节提取上表现不足，而扩散模型在复杂数据建模和纹理合成方面具有优势，因此探索其应用于交互式抠图。

Method: 1. 利用扩散模型先验，将文本驱动交互能力转化为视觉提示驱动交互；2. 在U-Net中集成坐标和透明度嵌入；3. 提出掩码自注意力机制以聚焦视觉提示区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SDMatte在交互式抠图中表现优异，尤其在边缘细节提取上效果显著。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动的交互设计，有效解决了现有方法在边缘细节提取上的不足，为交互式抠图提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先知道具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去偏见方法在简单或已知案例中表现良好，但在处理微妙或重叠偏见时效果不佳。

Method: AutoDebias利用视觉语言模型检测偏见视觉模式，并通过生成反映平衡表示的包容性替代提示来构建公平指南。

Result: 在覆盖25种以上偏见场景的基准测试中，AutoDebias检测有害模式的准确率为91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理微妙偏见和多重交互偏见，同时保持原始模型的图像质量和多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生物生长的时序动态对多个领域至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面有限。

Method: 提出CLIPTime框架，结合视觉和文本输入，联合学习嵌入并进行分类和回归预测。

Result: 实验表明CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，并生成可解释的时间预测。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合任务由于光谱与空间信息的固有权衡及观测数据有限，本质上是不适定的。以往研究未能有效解决数据不对齐导致的不适定问题。

Method: 提出PIF-Net框架，结合不适定先验和可逆Mamba架构，确保特征转换和融合中的信息一致性；引入Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，PIF-Net在图像恢复性能上显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过创新架构和模块设计，有效解决了多光谱和高光谱图像融合中的不适定问题，实现了高性能和高效率。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR有效解决了复杂视频超分辨率任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在RGB或深度域中使用欧几里得表示，难以捕捉事件的层次结构和时空连续性。

Method: 提出HyPCV-Former，通过点云提取器提取空间特征，并将其嵌入Lorentzian双曲空间，结合双曲多头自注意力机制建模时间动态。

Result: 在TIMo和DAD数据集上分别实现了7%和5.6%的性能提升。

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former在双曲空间中直接进行特征变换和异常评分，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考图像合成中保持空间布局一致性和背景一致性的挑战。

Method: 基于MMDiT模型，引入Group Isolation Attention (GIA)和Region-Modulated Attention (RMA)两种注意力机制。

Result: LAMIC在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有方法，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了无需训练的新范式，并有望随基础模型的发展而扩展。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息，而实际筛查中需要结合时间点和放射学评估。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)块动态整合历史与当前扫描信息，以及BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR)损失函数嵌入领域知识。

Result: 在DCE-MRI数据集上，Dice分数比现有方法提高5%，TPA和BCR均贡献互补性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，提供了一种高效且准确的遥感图像标注解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Motivation: 第一人称视频在增强现实和机器人等领域日益重要，但现有研究多集中于第三人称视频，第一人称视频的时空定位研究不足。

Method: 通过自动标注管道构建EgoMask基准和EgoMask-Train训练集，分析第一人称视频的挑战（如物体持续时间短、轨迹稀疏等）。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在第一人称视频上表现不佳，但通过EgoMask-Train微调后显著提升，且不影响第三人称数据集性能。

Conclusion: EgoMask为第一人称视频理解提供了关键资源和见解。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

### [61] [Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00548)
*Seunghyun Shin,Dongmin Shin,Jisu Shin,Hae-Gon Jeon,Joon-Young Lee*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参考的视频色彩分级框架，通过扩散模型生成查找表（LUT）实现色彩属性对齐，支持用户通过文本提示调整低层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易用且高效。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示增强低层特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效完成视频色彩分级，且保持结构细节和快速推理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为视频色彩分级提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估了当前先进的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像中定位解剖结构相对位置的能力，发现所有模型均表现不佳。通过视觉提示改进效果有限，并提出了新的基准数据集MIRP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于解剖结构和异常的相对位置理解，但现有VLMs在此任务上表现不足，亟需研究改进。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等VLMs的能力，尝试使用视觉提示（如标记）提升性能，并创建了MIRP数据集。

Result: 所有模型在医学图像中表现不佳，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，模型更依赖先验知识而非图像内容。

Conclusion: VLMs在医学图像定位任务中表现不足，需进一步研究改进，MIRP数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的对抗净化框架DBLP，通过噪声桥蒸馏和自适应语义增强实现快速且高质量的净化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的对抗净化方法需要大量迭代去噪，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用噪声桥蒸馏目标，在潜在一致性模型中建立对抗噪声与干净数据的对齐，并结合多尺度金字塔边缘图增强语义保真度。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA的鲁棒准确率和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP是迈向实时对抗净化的重大进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过利用视觉编码器中的分层注意力结构，显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中视觉令牌序列过长导致的计算开销大和推理效率低的问题。

Method: 利用分层注意力结构选择三类信息丰富的令牌：锚定令牌、缓冲令牌和注册令牌。

Result: 在多个模型和任务中，HiPrune实现了最先进的剪枝性能，保留高达99.3%的任务准确率，同时减少推理计算量和延迟。

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的视觉令牌剪枝方法，适用于多种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中验证了FreeCP的有效性，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP作为即插即用模块，显著提升了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Motivation: 铰接物体是日常环境中重要的交互对象，但现有方法在物理合理性和点云对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 使用带符号距离函数（SDFs）表示部件形状，通过点云对齐损失和非穿透性、移动性约束指导扩散过程。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上评估，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间提供了平衡。

Conclusion: PhysNAP能够生成物理合理的铰接物体，并在点云对齐和约束一致性上优于无指导的扩散模型。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取精确的边界框标注耗时且昂贵，尤其是需要专家知识的科学领域。

Method: 使用预训练模型的知识蒸馏，通过优化方法和缩小的感受野提取病毒颗粒，生成伪标签。

Result: 生成的伪标签比其他弱标注方法更易获取，且在标注时间有限的情况下优于真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注成本，同时提高了目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoProU-VO是一种新颖的无监督视觉里程计方法，通过跨帧不确定性传播有效处理动态场景中的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体和遮挡会导致传统无监督视觉里程计方法在静态场景假设下产生错误的姿态估计。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO，结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，通过概率公式进行跨帧传播，基于视觉Transformer同时学习深度、不确定性和相机姿态。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有无监督单目方法，尤其在高速公路场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播显著提升了动态场景下的视觉里程计性能。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

<details>

Motivation: 现实自动驾驶场景中，语义分割模型常因误分类未知物体而失败，现有方法在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: 采用证据分类器和似然比测试，结合不确定性建模，生成概率分布而非点估计。

Result: 在五个标准数据集上，平均误报率降至2.5%，平均精度达90.91%，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，有效提升了未知物体检测的准确性，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要在涉及弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的复杂行为场景中可靠运行，但现有数据集中这些边缘案例的检索具有挑战性。

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，将其编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，支持通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高效检索和评估人类行为场景的工具，并扩展了Waymo Open Dataset为WayMoCo数据集。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NTL数据时间覆盖有限（始于2012年），且现有扩展方法存在光强度低估和结构遗漏的缺陷。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构造阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提高初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩模增强结构细节。

Conclusion: EVAL数据集为研究社区提供了可靠的长期分析资源，并已公开共享。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的外部安全措施（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在局限性，如忽略模型特定变化、易受对抗攻击或计算成本高。因此，需要一种高效且准确的NSFW检测方法。

Method: Wukong利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和U-Net的预训练交叉注意力参数，在扩散过程中进行早期检测。

Result: Wukong在NSFW检测任务中显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器精度相当，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: Wukong提供了一种高效且准确的NSFW检测方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中的运动场通常表现出异构模式，现有方法缺乏针对性建模策略，导致估计结果偏离真实结构。

Method: 提出Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition策略和MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier，分别用于运动场分解和子场增强。

Result: 在相对位姿和单应性估计任务中优于现有方法，并展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效解决了异构运动场建模问题，为两视图几何提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 构建一个通用且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型具有挑战性，主要由于人体姿态的复杂性和高质量数据集的稀缺。

Method: 提出DPoser-X，采用扩散模型作为姿态先验，结合截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，统一解决姿态任务。

Result: 在身体、手部、面部和全身姿态建模的多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPoser-X为全身人体姿态先验建模设立了新标准。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Motivation: 无约束环境中的人脸识别系统面临光照、姿态等挑战，需要依赖人脸检测模块进行对齐。然而，这些模块易受攻击，因此研究其脆弱性及防御方法具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一种新型攻击方法——地标偏移攻击，针对人脸检测器的坐标回归任务进行后门攻击。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了人脸检测模块的脆弱性，并提出了相应的缓解措施，为系统安全性提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture
images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face
poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that
regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face
Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time
a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过生成模型合成属性标注数据的方法，以解决医学图像数据集中属性标注稀缺的问题，并提升了可解释模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中，可解释的分类模型能增强临床医生的信任和使用意愿。然而，由于缺乏大规模属性标注的医学图像数据集，这类模型的推广受到限制。

Method: 通过增强扩散模型（Diffusion Model）的属性条件化，仅使用20个标注样本生成合成数据，并将其用于训练可解释模型。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据的加入使属性预测准确率提升了13.4%，目标预测准确率提升了1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能够有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的适用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对目标检测器的补丁防御基准，通过大规模数据集和综合分析揭示了防御自然补丁的关键因素，并提供了改进现有防御方法的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致且不完整，因此需要建立一个全面的基准来改进防御方法。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的大规模基准数据集。

Result: 发现自然补丁防御的难点在于数据分布而非高频特征；平均精度与防御性能高度一致；自适应攻击可绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，并开源了代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Motivation: 现有去雾方法受限于架构设计，难以适应不同场景的准确性和效率需求。

Method: 利用预训练的深度特征，设计了一个即插即用的RGB-D融合模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中有效且具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在图像去雾中具有显著一致性，提出的模块能灵活集成到不同架构中。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二阶动力学分析的训练免费检测方法D3，用于识别AI生成视频中的时间伪影，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法对合成视频中的时间伪影探索不足，导致检测效果有限。

Method: 通过牛顿力学下的二阶动力学分析，提出Second-order Central Difference特征，并基于此设计D3方法。

Result: 在4个开源数据集上验证，D3比之前最佳方法提升10.39%的平均精度，且计算高效、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: D3通过二阶时间差异有效区分真实与AI生成视频，为合成内容检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

TL;DR: 首次系统研究多图像MLLM中的幻觉问题，提出MIHBench基准，并设计动态注意力平衡机制以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单图像场景，多图像场景中的幻觉问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIHBench基准，包含三个核心任务，并设计动态注意力平衡机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少幻觉，提升多图像场景的语义整合和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态注意力平衡机制在多图像MLLM中显著减少幻觉，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

TL;DR: YOLO-Count是一个可微分的开放词汇对象计数模型，解决了通用计数挑战，并为文本到图像（T2I）生成提供了精确的数量控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计数方法在开放词汇和T2I生成控制方面存在不足，YOLO-Count旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的'基数'映射作为回归目标，结合表示对齐和混合强弱监督方案，构建了完全可微分的架构。

Result: 实验表明，YOLO-Count在计数准确性上达到最先进水平，并为T2I系统提供了有效的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count成功地将开放词汇计数与T2I生成控制结合，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

*Adwait Chandorkar,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，用于3D目标检测，显著降低计算成本同时保持高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络（如VGG或ResNet），导致模型复杂度高。轻量级骨干在2D检测中已有研究，但在3D检测中仍有限。

Method: 设计Dense Backbone骨干网络，结合高处理速度、轻量架构和鲁棒检测精度，适配多种先进3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上参数减少29%，延迟降低28%，检测精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone为点云数据3D检测提供首个密集层骨干，具有即插即用特性，易于集成现有架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

TL;DR: GECO提出了一种基于最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，显著提升了语义对应任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督视觉基础模型缺乏对3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输框架进行训练，支持遮挡和去遮挡情况下的监督。

Result: 在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上达到SOTA，PCK提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps。

Conclusion: PCK不足以衡量几何质量，GECO提出了新指标，推动几何感知特征学习的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Motivation: 随着逼真虚拟头像的普及，其带来的安全风险（如冒充）日益严重，传统视觉或听觉检测难以识别欺诈行为。

Method: 使用GAGAvatar生成真实和冒充的虚拟头像视频数据集，并提出基于面部关键点的时空图卷积网络架构。

Result: 实验表明，面部运动特征可实现有效的身份验证，AUC值接近80%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在虚拟头像通信系统中加强行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并为社区提供了基准和生物识别系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN是一种针对卫星图像的SR框架，结合了ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，提供语义一致性和像素级不确定性，适用于无人机和卫星系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs在图像超分辨率中缺乏语义一致性和像素级置信度，限制了其在遥感关键应用中的可信度。

Method: SU-ESRGAN整合了ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，生成像素级不确定性图。

Result: SU-ESRGAN在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS上与基线ESRGAN相当，并在跨域应用中表现出适应性。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在卫星和无人机系统中具有实用价值，强调了领域感知训练在SR应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试时间适应（TTA）框架，用于动态调整医学图像转换过程，以处理分布外样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像转换技术在处理分布外样本时性能下降，需要一种动态适应方法。

Method: 引入重建模块量化域偏移，并通过动态适应块选择性修改预训练模型的内部特征。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI转换任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态、样本特定的调整是提高模型在真实场景中鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

TL;DR: PILOT框架通过双分支提示学习和无标签测试时适应策略，提升了零样本异常检测在域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域偏移下表现不佳，因为训练数据来自有限领域，难以泛化到新分布。

Method: 提出双分支提示学习机制和标签无关的测试时适应策略，动态整合可学习提示与语义属性。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在异常检测和定位上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PILOT通过自适应提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

TL;DR: 研究分析了异构标记点云数据集的语义分割性能，重点关注公共安全应用中的挑战和性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共安全应用中，统一不同标记的3D数据存在挑战，需要评估语义分割性能以提升导航和安全关键特征的检测。

Method: 使用NIST的Point Cloud City数据集，采用KPConv架构和分级模式，通过IoU指标评估性能。

Result: 几何较大的物体（如楼梯、窗户）分割性能较高，而较小的安全关键特征识别率较低，受类别不平衡和几何限制影响。

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需要标准化标注协议和改进标记技术，以解决数据异构性和小物体检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGL-Nav是一种基于3D高斯表示的高效图像目标导航框架，通过增量更新和几何信息匹配实现目标定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，导致导航效率低。

Method: 采用增量3D高斯表示，结合粗粒度几何匹配和细粒度优化，实现高效目标定位。

Result: IGL-Nav在多样实验配置中显著优于现有方法，并能处理自由视角图像目标导航。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav为图像目标导航提供了一种高效且3D感知的解决方案，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Conclusion: OSF通过光流和单阶段设计，显著提升了基于绘图的3D动画的质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

### [91] [SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782)
*Kien T. Pham,Yingqing He,Yazhou Xing,Qifeng Chen,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpA2V是一个新颖的框架，通过利用音频中的空间听觉线索生成语义和空间对齐的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了音频中的空间属性（如位置和运动方向），而人类能够自然识别这些信息。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SpA2V分为两个阶段：1）音频引导的视频规划，利用MLLM从音频中提取空间和语义线索生成视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局引导的视频生成，将VSL作为条件输入预训练的扩散模型，以训练自由的方式生成视频。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能够生成与输入音频在语义和空间上对齐的逼真视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过显式利用空间听觉线索，显著提升了音频驱动视频生成的准确性和逼真度。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

*Shixin Yi,Lin Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRGI是一个模块化框架，通过视觉验证增强多模态推理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示在视觉语言模型中产生的幻觉问题，缺乏视觉内容的验证。

Method: 提出CoRGI框架，包含文本推理链生成、视觉证据提取和综合验证三个阶段。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中提升推理性能，人类评估显示更事实性和有帮助的解释。

Conclusion: 视觉证据的中间步骤验证对增强多模态推理鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文指出神经解码研究中重复刺激会导致模型性能被高估，影响研究结论的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示神经解码研究中因重复刺激导致的性能高估问题，评估其对现有研究的影响。

Method: 分析了16篇受影响的研究，通过实验验证重复刺激对模型性能的影响程度。

Result: 发现模型性能被高估4.46-7.42%，且每增加1%准确率，高估幅度增加0.26%。

Conclusion: 重复刺激问题不仅导致性能高估，还削弱了研究结论的可靠性，甚至可能支持伪科学主张。

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli
are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of
publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research
to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments
have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in
some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant
to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However,
when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the
same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this
the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16
publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures
affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the
affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the
literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding
accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our
analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound,
the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only
results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the
validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted
further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in
alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the
affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific
claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

Motivation: 通过整合大规模视频-文本-音频语料库，解决多模态输入条件下的音频生成任务，提升语义丰富性和声学多样性。

Method: 采用统一的歌词-转录编码器，结合AdaLN联合注意力机制和PAAPI技术，解冻所有模态并掩码缺失输入。

Result: 在音频质量、语义对齐和唇同步准确性上表现优异，同时在文本到音频/语音/歌曲任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AudioGen-Omni在效率和通用性上均有显著提升，推理时间短，适用于多种音频生成任务。

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion
transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and
songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a
novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale
video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically
rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable
to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified
lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung
and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level
representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism
enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein
RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure
precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and
masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of
text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint
training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync
accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on
Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8
seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and
generality.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion
models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision
events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark,
gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset
are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are
trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents.
We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency
models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches
based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The
fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency
models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based
diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in
computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for
High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains
challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical
for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel
approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a
single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a
Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical
context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency
constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a
continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This
instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex
root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our
method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public
medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance,
averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the
second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test
sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root
segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root
resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We

Method: 使用Frangi血管滤波器生成软血管先验，结合注意力机制，通过多任务UNet同时进行检测和分割。

Conclusion: 该方法在颅内动脉瘤的检测和分割任务中表现出色，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels
that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their
small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to
perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are
critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large
public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for
developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we
proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates
vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in
time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA
detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to
derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention
block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary
branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth
segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same
database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it
externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm
segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =
1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to
increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require
meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical
visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed
decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have
shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of
stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent
approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and
class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach
that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic
lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on
lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset
sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house
dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach
maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with
limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment
of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable
decision support.

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation

traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious
challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of
in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained
by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard,
vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative
execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To
support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging
scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint
selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent
DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the
clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to
single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight,
and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of
distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness
and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN方法依赖顺序语言指令，限制了可扩展性和自主性，UAV-ON通过语义目标导航填补了这一空白。

Method: UAV-ON包含14个高保真Unreal Engine环境，定义了1270个标注目标对象，并提出了Aerial ObjectNav Agent（AOA）作为基线方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有基线方法在这一场景中表现不佳，突显了空中导航和语义目标定位的挑战。

Conclusion: UAV-ON旨在推动基于语义目标的无人机自主导航研究，适用于复杂现实环境。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

TL;DR: LightDP是一种专为移动设备设计的轻量级扩散策略框架，通过网络压缩和减少采样步骤实现实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在资源受限的移动平台上因计算效率低和内存占用大而难以应用。

Method: 采用网络压缩和采样步骤减少策略，结合剪枝和一致性蒸馏技术。

Result: 在标准数据集上实现实时动作预测，性能接近最先进的扩散策略。

Conclusion: LightDP为资源有限环境中扩散策略的实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的浅层时间反馈模块（STF），用于提升基于Transformer的脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在静态数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度级反馈循环设计导致高计算成本和延迟，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: STF模块包含时空位置嵌入（TSPE）和时间反馈（TF），通过增强脉冲模式的多样性提升性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K等数据集上表现优异，且对抗鲁棒性和时间敏感性优于直接编码方法。

Conclusion: STF是一种高效的脉冲编码方案，适用于静态场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great
performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced
deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow
this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in
costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy
consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose
Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for
the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding
(TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF
consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN
backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K,
under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF
enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain.
Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity
confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its
potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Stress-Aware Learning（SAL）是一种动态调整优化行为的神经网络训练范式，通过临时和永久变形概念提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受材料科学中结构疲劳的启发，旨在解决训练过程中优化困难的问题，帮助模型逃离尖锐最小值，收敛到更平坦的损失区域。

Method: 提出Plastic Deformation Optimizer，通过内部应力信号检测训练停滞，并注入自适应噪声以调整参数。

Result: 在六种架构、四种优化器和七个视觉基准测试中，表现出更高的鲁棒性和泛化能力，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: SAL通过动态调整优化行为，显著提升了模型的性能，代码和可视化工具已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training
paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization
behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain
dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic)
Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To
instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a
stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters
whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and
accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model
to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions
of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers,
and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization
with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

TL;DR: KRAdapter是一种新型的PEFT算法，通过Khatri-Rao乘积生成权重更新，解决了LoRA在近似高有效秩矩阵时的局限性，并在大规模模型上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在多模态和大语言模型中的局限性促使研究者开发更高效的PEFT方法。

Method: 提出KRAdapter算法，利用Khatri-Rao乘积生成高有效秩的权重更新。

Result: KRAdapter在1B参数的视觉语言模型和8B参数的大语言模型上表现优于LoRA，尤其在常识推理任务中。

Conclusion: KRAdapter是一种高效且实用的PEFT方法，适用于大规模模型的微调。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for
adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted
its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when
applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a
quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a
synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties.
Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively
flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks.
To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the
Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to
produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance
gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large
language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense
reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute
efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune
billion-scale parameter models.
