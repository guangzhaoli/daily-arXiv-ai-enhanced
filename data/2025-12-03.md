TL;DR: 该研究评估了地理空间基础模型TerraMind在全球洪水范围测绘中的性能，通过多模态数据微调发现其在准确性和计算效率方面表现良好，但传统U-Net模型在召回率方面仍有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最具破坏性的天气相关灾害之一，2024年作为有记录以来最热年份，极端洪水事件影响了五大洲的社区。虽然地球观测卫星为洪水测绘提供了关键数据，但现有模型的泛化能力有限，需要评估新型地理空间基础模型在全球洪水事件中的实际性能。

Method: 使用FloodsNet数据集（包含全球85个洪水事件的多模态Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2影像）对TerraMind进行微调，测试了四种配置（基础vs大型模型；冻结vs非冻结骨干网络），并与TerraMind Sen1Floods11示例和U-Net模型进行比较。

Result: 基础非冻结配置在准确性、精确度和召回率方面取得了最佳平衡，且计算成本显著低于大型模型。大型非冻结模型实现了最高召回率。基于FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练的示例。U-Net在所有GFM配置中获得了更高的召回率，但准确性和精确度略低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，整合多模态光学和SAR数据并微调GFM可以增强近实时洪水测绘能力。该研究为GFM在洪水分割中的全球规模评估提供了首批成果，揭示了其在气候适应和灾害韧性方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文增强的对比损失函数，通过包含两个收敛目标来同时提高对比学习效果并解决信息失真问题。该方法在8个大规模基准数据集上优于16种最先进的对比学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习机制可能导致信息失真，模型过度依赖相同标签样本的信息，而忽视来自同一原始图像的正样本对。特别是在大规模数据集中，这种问题更加明显。

Method: 提出上下文增强对比损失函数，包含两个组件：第一个组件对标签对比敏感，区分相同和不同类别的特征；第二个组件拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，同时推远所有其他样本。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100、Caltech-101、Caltech-256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace和CelebA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在泛化性能和学习收敛速度方面均优于16种现有方法。在BiasedMNIST数据集上相比原始对比损失函数有22.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 该技术能够有效解决系统性失真问题，在提高对比学习效率的同时促进更公平的下游训练。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合评估文本到图像（T2I）模型和视觉语言模型（VLM）的层次化框架，通过测试VLM能否识别T2I模型生成的图像中的27种特定失败模式，揭示了当前生成模型在属性保真度和对象表示方面的系统性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型虽然能生成视觉上令人印象深刻的图像，但经常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性（如对象数量和颜色）。同时，VLM的评估标准未能跟上其标注复杂场景的能力发展，需要更精细的评估方法来比较不同图像生成模型的提示遵循能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含5个T2I模型（Flux、SD3系列）生成的图像和3个VLM（Molmo、InternVL3、Pixtral）标注的数据集，使用LLM（Llama3）来验证VLM是否能正确识别图像中的27种特定失败模式。通过分析精心设计的提示集上的失败模式，系统评估模型的属性保真度。

Result: 研究发现当前指标不足以捕捉这些细微的错误，揭示了T2I模型在属性保真度和对象表示方面存在系统性错误。VLM在识别复杂场景中的特定失败模式方面表现有限。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对性基准测试的重要性，指出需要更精细的评估框架来推动生成模型的可靠性和可解释性发展，现有评估标准需要改进以更好地反映模型在实际应用中的表现。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为LLOST的深度潜在变量模型，通过医学图像预测患者的体细胞突变谱，结合点云表示和变分自编码器技术，在癌症早期诊断和治疗中具有应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗的疗效往往依赖于早期诊断和治疗，医学影像是临床医生确定癌症诊断的关键初始工具，而基因信息在后续诊断阶段用于选择特定治疗方案。该研究旨在通过医学图像预测患者的体细胞突变特征，实现更早的干预。

Method: 提出LLOST模型，采用双变分自编码器结构，通过独立的共享潜在空间统一病变点云特征和体细胞突变计数。模型包含三个潜在空间，每个空间使用条件归一化流先验来适应不同域的分布多样性。首先引入病变图像的点云表示以实现对成像模态的不变性。

Result: 在TCIA医学图像和TCGA Pan Cancer数据集上的定性和定量实验表明，模型在预测特定突变计数和准确预测突变发生方面表现良好。特别发现了反映癌症类型的影像学和体细胞突变域之间的共享模式。

Conclusion: 论文总结了模型的预测性能，并提出了改进模型的建议，包括未来研究可以纳入其他遗传域的可能性。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）能够实现高质量的新视角合成，但训练时低分辨率输入视图的超分辨率处理会导致多视角不一致和模糊渲染。SplatSuRe方法通过选择性应用超分辨率内容，仅在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域添加细节，从而获得更清晰一致的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D高斯泼溅中对所有图像统一应用超分辨率处理导致的多视角不一致问题，利用相机姿态与场景几何的相对关系来指导超分辨率内容的添加位置。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe方法，基于关键洞察：近距离低分辨率视图可能包含远处视图也捕获区域的高频信息，通过相机姿态相对于场景几何来指导在欠采样区域选择性应用超分辨率内容。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，该方法在保真度和感知质量上均超过基线方法，特别是在需要更高细节的局部前景区域效果最显著。

Conclusion: SplatSuRe通过选择性超分辨率策略有效解决了多视角不一致问题，在3D高斯泼溅中实现了更清晰和一致的渲染效果，特别是在细节要求高的区域表现优异。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [6] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于手术场景分割的鲁棒方法，通过利用风格和内容信息来提升对未见分布和模态变化的泛化能力，并引入了一个新的多中心数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习手术场景分割方法在单中心和单模态数据上表现良好，但无法泛化到未见分布和模态，而自然场景的域适应方法不能直接应用于手术场景，因为手术场景视觉线索有限且场景极其多样。

Method: 通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术来获得鲁棒特征表示，并在ResNet骨干网络中引入恢复模块以保留有用的任务相关特征。

Result: 在HeiCholSeg数据集上，RobustSurg相比基线DeepLabv3+提升近23%，相比SOTA方法提升10-32%；在EndoUDA息肉数据集上，相比基线提升近22%，相比SOTA方法提升近11%。

Conclusion: 提出的RobustSurg方法能够有效提升手术场景分割在不同中心和模态下的泛化性能，为解决该领域的泛化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [7] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种归纳先验方法：单分形和多分形重校准，用于解决现有端到端多分形方法在语义分割等任务中的局限性。这些方法利用指数概率质量与多分形谱之间的关系，在卷积网络中实现为通道注意力函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多分形方法依赖于大量池化或强特征空间抽取，限制了语义分割等任务的性能。

Method: 引入Monofractal和Multifractal Recalibration两种归纳先验方法，基于U-Net框架实现通道注意力机制，利用多分形分析描述编码器嵌入的统计特性。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集（ISIC18、Kvasir-SEG、BUSI）上验证，多分形重校准相比使用高阶统计的其他通道注意力机制基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多分形重校准能有效提升性能，且发现U-Net架构中由于跳跃连接，激励响应不会随编码器深度增加而过度专业化，其有效性可能与实例变异性的全局统计相关。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [8] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Unified-VQA框架，通过将通用视频质量评估重新定义为诊断混合专家问题，解决了现有方法缺乏可解释性和格式特异性限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法通常采用单一模型预测质量分数，无法提供诊断性反馈，且多为格式特定的专用指标而非真正通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出诊断混合专家框架，使用多个感知专家处理不同感知域，采用多代理专家训练策略和弱监督学习优化多任务头，生成全局质量分数和可解释的多维伪影向量。

Result: 在17个包含不同流媒体伪影的数据库上，Unified-VQA在通用VQA和诊断伪影检测任务中表现优于18种基准方法，支持HD、UHD、HDR和HFR格式。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向实用、可操作和可解释的视频质量评估迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench是一个专注于说话人中心视听推理的基准测试，包含3,212个多选题，评估多模态大语言模型在真实视频中对说话人、说话内容和时间点的细粒度推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试很少评估对人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务仅通过视觉即可解决或对语音评估过于粗糙，无法判断模型是否能准确对齐说话人身份、说话内容和时间关系。

Method: 提出AV-SpeakerBench基准，采用说话人中心的表述方式，将说话人而非场景作为核心推理单元；设计融合基础的问题，将视听依赖关系嵌入问题语义中；通过专家标注确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: 评估显示Gemini系列模型表现最佳，Gemini 2.5 Pro达到最优结果。开源模型中Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要差距在于视听融合能力而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统的细粒度视听推理研究建立了严谨的基础，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的图像去雨方法，通过创新的VLIF神经元解决了传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解的问题，在显著降低能耗的同时实现了优于现有SNN方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生物合理且节能的脉冲神经网络在低层视觉任务中的应用，特别是图像去雨任务，解决传统脉冲神经元在表示高频特性和空间上下文理解方面的局限性。

Method: 提出视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元来克服传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解的问题；利用VLIF引入脉冲分解增强模块和轻量级脉冲多尺度单元，实现分层多尺度表示学习。

Result: 在五个基准去雨数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的基于SNN的去雨方法，且仅消耗其13%的能量。

Conclusion: 该研究为在高性能、节能的低层视觉任务中部署SNN奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SPF（时空金字塔流）方法，通过分层建模时空尺度实现高效并行气候模拟，在ClimateBench上优于现有方法，并创建最大气候模拟数据集ClimateSuite。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法依赖天气尺度自回归，对长期气候模拟速度慢且稳定性不足，需要开发能处理非平稳强迫的高效气候模拟方法。

Method: SPF将生成轨迹划分为时空金字塔，逐步增加空间分辨率减少计算量，每个阶段与特定时间尺度耦合，支持直接采样任意时间尺度，并结合物理强迫条件。

Result: 在ClimateBench上SPF在年和月尺度上优于强基线模型，采样速度快，特别是在较粗时间尺度。基于33,000+模拟年的ClimateSuite数据集验证了良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF和ClimateSuite为跨时间尺度和真实未来场景的准确、高效、概率性气候模拟提供了基础，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新利用CogVideo模型进行渐进式视觉修复任务，通过微调使其生成修复轨迹而非自然视频运动，在超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强等任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在时间生成方面表现出色，但它们在图像修复方面的潜力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建合成数据集用于超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强任务，每个样本展示从退化到清晰帧的渐进过渡。比较两种提示策略：统一文本提示和基于LLaVA多模态LLM生成的场景特定提示。

Result: 微调后的模型能够将时间进展与修复质量关联，产生的序列在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标上逐帧提升。模型在ReLoBlur数据集上无需额外训练即表现出强大的零样本鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CogVideo模型能够有效恢复空间细节和光照一致性，同时保持时间连贯性，展示了通过时间修复实现强零样本鲁棒性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

TL;DR: MORP--Synth是一个两阶段合成增强框架，旨在解决SAR油污分割模型从地中海到秘鲁海域的泛化问题，通过形态学区域扰动和条件生成模型提升跨区域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习SAR油污分割模型在不同海域（如地中海和秘鲁海岸）间泛化能力差，主要由于海况、后向散射统计和油污形态的差异，且秘鲁海域标注数据稀缺。

Method: 1. 阶段A：形态学区域扰动（Morphological Region Perturbation），通过曲率引导的标签空间方法生成油污和类油区域的几何变体；2. 阶段B：使用条件生成模型INADE从编辑后的掩码渲染SAR-like纹理。

Result: 在秘鲁数据集（2112个标注图像）上，预训练于地中海数据的模型mIoU从67.8%降至51.8%；MORP--Synth将mIoU提升最多6个百分点，少数类IoU显著提升（油污类+10.8，类油类+14.6）。

Conclusion: MORP--Synth有效缓解了跨海域SAR油污分割的域偏移问题，通过合成数据增强提升了模型在数据稀缺区域的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预训练视频扩散模型的自监督跟踪方法，通过利用扩散模型在去噪过程中自然学习的运动表示来区分视觉上相似的对象，在现有基准测试中相比近期自监督方法提升了6个点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中视觉上相似对象难以通过运动区分的挑战，现有自监督跟踪器在视觉线索模糊时表现不佳，而监督方法需要大量标注数据。

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型在去噪过程中自然学习的运动表示，早期高噪声阶段分离出运动信息，后期阶段处理外观细化，无需任务特定训练即可实现跟踪。

Result: 在现有基准测试和新引入的视觉相似对象跟踪测试中，相比近期自监督方法实现了高达6个点的性能提升，能够鲁棒跟踪即使是完全相同的对象。

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型内在的运动表示能力为自监督跟踪提供了新的解决方案，特别是在处理视觉上相似对象的挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于薄板样条的高自由度长期对齐框架，用于解决3D视觉基础模型在在线场景中时间一致性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D视觉基础模型在在线部署时（如驾驶场景），由于在时间窗口内进行预测，难以保持时间一致性。现有方法通过求解全局变换来对齐连续预测，但存在假设有效性、局部对齐范围和噪声几何鲁棒性等根本局限性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了3D视觉基础模型在在线场景中的时间一致性问题，具有广泛的适用性和优越的性能。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

Method: 1. 使用训练无关剪枝作为探测方法，分析深度剪枝和宽度缩减对模型的影响；2. 提出MoE适配方法，将生成模块划分为多个专家并启用稀疏激活；3. 通过专家冻结调优验证稀疏激活有效性，并展示完全可训练适配的额外增益。

Result: 研究发现理解组件在理解和生成任务中都具有显著压缩性，而生成组件对压缩高度敏感。提出的BAGEL模型在仅激活约50%参数的情况下，性能与完整模型相当。

Conclusion: 统一多模态模型的不同组件具有不同的压缩特性，理解组件可压缩性强，生成组件需要更精细的稀疏激活策略。MoE适配方法能有效提升模型效率，为构建高效多模态模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

Conclusion: 该方法比标定方法更适合实际部署，实现了更实用的多视角人群计数

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见域多样性之间的差距，为隐私约束下的领域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Motivation: 现有端到端多目标跟踪方法虽然检测性能强，但关联精度较低，主要原因是共享DETR架构产生的对象嵌入在帧间相似度过高，缺乏实例级别的区分能力。

Result: 在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BFT等多个挑战性MOT基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了所提特征增强策略的有效性。

Conclusion: FDTA通过多视角特征细化显著提升了对象嵌入的区分度，有效解决了端到端多目标跟踪中的关联精度问题，为实例级别的跨帧跟踪提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

TL;DR: Skywork-R1V4是一个30B参数的智能体模型，通过统一多模态规划、图像操作和深度搜索能力，仅使用监督学习就实现了最先进的性能，在11个指标上超越Gemini 2.5 Flash。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将图像操作和网络搜索视为分离能力、过度依赖强化学习、缺乏基于真实工具执行轨迹的规划等问题。

Method: 采用监督微调训练，使用少于30,000个高质量规划-执行一致轨迹，通过交错推理动态交替视觉操作和外部知识检索。

Result: 在MMSearch上得分66.1，FVQA上得分67.2，能够协调超过10个工具调用来解决复杂多步骤任务。

Conclusion: 精心设计的监督学习单独就能实现复杂的智能多模态智能，无需依赖强化学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模目标-环境关系和环境-动作规划，有效解决了开放词汇目标导航的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: WISE框架能有效提升多模态任务的推理性能，证明了多智能体辩论在视觉语言推理问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标准指标优化下难以检测薄壁结构，且生成的掩码边界不规则，缺乏后续矢量化所需的几何精度，影响了室内空间3D重建的自动化流程。

Method: 采用分层Mix-Transformer编码器捕获全局上下文，U-Net解码器结合scSE注意力模块进行精确边界恢复，并使用Tversky损失函数优化策略平衡精度和召回率，通过超参数调优抑制边界假阳性噪声。

Conclusion: MitUNet为自动化3D重建管道的数据准备提供了稳健工具，显著提升了墙体分割的几何精度。

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型微调方法通常在整个数据集上训练单一通用模型，这会损害模型在未见领域的泛化能力。需要一种既能保持领域特异性又能提升泛化能力的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段GuiDG框架：1）使用提示调优获得源领域专家模型；2）引入跨模态注意力模块，通过自适应专家集成指导视觉编码器微调。

Result: 在标准领域泛化基准和新建的ImageNet-DG数据集上的实验表明，GuiDG在保持效率的同时优于现有最先进的微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，训练多个参数高效的专家模型比微调单一通用模型能获得更好的领域泛化能力，GuiDG框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型的发展，GUI智能体任务从单屏任务转向复杂屏幕导航挑战。然而，真实GUI环境复杂且专有，难以获取全面环境信息，这限制了智能体导航能力的系统研究和基准测试。

Method: 1) 引入GUI Exploration Lab模拟环境引擎，支持灵活定义和组合屏幕、图标和导航图；2) 采用监督微调记忆基础知识；3) 单轮强化学习增强对未见过场景的泛化能力；4) 多轮强化学习通过交互试错开发探索策略。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在GUI导航中具有明显优势，为构建更强大、可泛化的GUI智能体提供了实用指导，多轮强化学习特别有助于开发有效的探索策略。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Conclusion: WorldMM通过多模态记忆架构和自适应检索机制，有效解决了长视频理解中的挑战，证明了其在长视频推理任务上的有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提升了青光眼检测性能，还增强了AI驱动的干预分析可能性，为临床诊断提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Conclusion: 该方法在减少资源需求的同时提升性能，推动了高效多模态学习的发展。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TDE（Temporal Dynamics Enhancer）的方法，通过增强SNN的时间信息建模能力来解决现有SNN在复杂任务（如目标检测）中表达能力不足的问题。TDE包含两个模块：Spiking Encoder（SE）和Attention Gating Module（AGM），并通过Spike-Driven Attention（SDA）降低能量消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN通常直接复制输入或按固定间隔聚合为帧，导致神经元在不同时间步接收几乎相同的刺激，严重限制了模型在复杂任务（如目标检测）中的表达能力。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上达到57.7%的mAP50-95，在EvDET200K数据集上达到47.6%的mAP50-95，优于现有方法。SDA的能量消耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE可以无缝集成到现有的SNN检测器中，在保持高能效的同时显著提升了目标检测性能，为SNN在复杂视觉任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型主要基于合成数据集训练，只能处理单个房间或单层环境，无法处理大型多楼层建筑，且需要将场景分割为单层处理，这丢失了连接多个楼层的结构（如楼梯）所需的全局空间上下文信息。

Method: 提出了MultiFloor3D方法，这是一种基于近期场景理解方法的无需训练基线方法，能够处理多楼层和建筑结构复杂的空间。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Method: 提出基于聚类的ClusterStyle框架，使用原型集合建模同一风格类别中多样化的风格模式；考虑全局级（风格运动间）和局部级（时间动态）两种风格多样性；构建全局和局部两个结构化风格嵌入空间，通过与非学习原型锚点对齐优化；使用风格调制适配器（SMA）增强预训练文本到运动生成模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在风格化运动生成和运动风格迁移任务上优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: ClusterStyle框架通过结构化风格嵌入空间和原型建模，有效解决了风格内部多样性问题，在风格化运动生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，STL始终优于仅基于答案或自生成推理的基线方法，定性分析证实其推理质量较高

Conclusion: STL为增强视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Motivation: 探索音频-视频联合去噪训练是否能够超越同步性提升，真正改善视频生成质量，特别是在只关注视频模态的情况下。

Method: 提出参数高效的AVFullDiT架构，利用预训练的文本到视频和文本到音频模块进行联合去噪训练，并与仅视频训练模型在相同设置下进行对比。

Result: 实验首次系统证明音频-视频联合去噪能够带来超越同步性的改进，在具有大运动和物体接触的挑战性子集上观察到一致的视频质量提升。

Conclusion: 跨模态联合训练是开发更强、更具物理基础的世界模型的有前景方法，音频预测作为特权信号有助于模型内化视觉事件与声学后果之间的因果关系。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有具身任务研究主要关注单任务环境，但实际应用中智能体需要处理顺序任务，面临如何重用先前探索积累的空间知识来支持后续推理和探索的核心挑战。

Method: 提出3DSPMR方法，利用已探索区域的关系、视觉和几何线索来增强多模态大语言模型，首次将几何信息显式融入基于MLLM的空间理解和推理。

Result: 大量实验验证3DSPMR在顺序EQA和EMN任务上实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个将几何信息显式融入MLLM空间理解的工作，为解决顺序具身任务中的空间知识重用问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD实现了最先进的性能，特别是在高分辨率基准上获得了5.0%的准确率提升

Conclusion: TGDD在无需额外优化开销的情况下，在性能与效率之间实现了良好的平衡，能够保持语义多样性和代表性

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有视频世界模型在长时上下文输入中计算成本过高的问题，提升时空一致性和长时生成质量。

Method: 提出压缩记忆机制，包括轨迹打包（实现高上下文效率）和记忆检索（保持rollout一致性并辅助需要空间推理的长时生成）。

Result: 在Minecraft的LoopNav基准测试中，WorldPack在长时一致性评估方面显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: WorldPack通过高效的压缩记忆设计，成功解决了长时世界建模中的空间一致性和计算效率问题，为视频世界模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现有的高斯泼溅方法虽然推进了实时内窥镜重建，但通常依赖非商业衍生品，限制了可部署性。G-SHARP旨在克服这些限制。

Method: G-SHARP是首个基于GSplat（Apache-2.0）可微分高斯光栅化器构建的手术管道，支持原理性变形建模、鲁棒遮挡处理，并在EndoNeRF基准测试上实现高保真重建。

Result: 在EndoNeRF拉取基准测试中展示了最先进的重建质量，具有适合术中使用的强速度-精度权衡。

Conclusion: 提供了Holoscan SDK应用，可在NVIDIA IGX Orin和Thor边缘硬件上部署G-SHARP，实现实际手术室环境中的实时手术可视化。

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCAgents是一个分层多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审计实现单向收敛，解决医学视觉语言模型中的推理脱离问题，在提高诊断准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学诊断中存在推理脱离问题，即语言解释与可验证的图像证据脱节，影响临床信任。现有的多智能体辩论框架虽然能缓解单一模型偏见，但开放式讨论会放大文本噪声和计算成本，且未能将推理锚定在视觉证据上。

Method: 受临床工作流程启发，UCAgents禁止立场改变并将智能体交互限制在目标证据验证上，通过单向收敛结构抑制修辞漂移，同时增强视觉信号提取。引入一轮询问讨论来发现视觉-文本错位的潜在风险，通过信息理论形式化双重噪声瓶颈。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准测试中，UCAgents在PathVQA上达到71.3%的准确率（比现有最优方法提高6.0%），同时降低87.7%的token成本，在揭示更多视觉证据和避免文本干扰之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: UCAgents在诊断可靠性和计算效率方面表现出色，这对现实世界临床部署至关重要，证明了该框架在医学视觉问答任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出3D-SLIM，一种针对3D场景语言理解的注意力掩码策略，通过几何自适应掩码和指令感知掩码解决传统因果注意力在3D场景中的局限性，无需修改模型架构即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景语言理解中使用标准语言模型的因果注意力掩码，这导致了两个基本冲突：顺序无关的3D对象之间的顺序偏见，以及受限的对象-指令注意力，阻碍了任务特定的推理能力。

Method: 提出3D-SLIM掩码策略，包含几何自适应掩码（基于空间密度而非标记顺序约束注意力）和指令感知掩码（使对象标记能直接访问指令上下文），无需架构修改或额外参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和LLM基线上进行的广泛实验验证了其有效性，在多样化的3D场景语言任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM证明了解码器设计在3D多模态推理中的关键作用，提供了一种简单有效的解决方案来改进3D场景语言理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习和GMM的点集配准方法（如DeepGMR）在部分到部分配准中存在局限性，特别是在处理输入点集的平移和旋转不变性方面存在理论和实践问题。

Method: 提出了注意力参考点偏移层（ARPS），该层使用成熟的注意力模块来识别两个部分点集的共同参考点，从而获得变换不变的特征表示。

Result: ARPS层显著提升了DeepGMR及其最新变体UGMMReg的性能，并且这些扩展模型甚至优于先前使用注意力块和Transformer提取重叠区域或共同参考点的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为使用深度学习和GMM的配准方法提供了更深入的见解，ARPS方法为解决部分到部分点集配准问题提供了一种可理解的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

Result: 结果显示没有单一范式在所有条件下表现最佳：输入级方法在轻微外观变化下更稳定；特征级和输出级方法在边界相关指标上优势更大；先验方法表现出强烈的模态依赖性；多个方法在大的跨中心和跨设备变化下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA为测试时适应研究提供了标准化数据集、验证实现和公开排行榜，为开发鲁棒、临床可靠的测试时适应方法建立了严格基础，强调了根据临床部署需求进行原则性方法选择的重要性。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Result: 在需要结构化、面向对象输出的基准测试中达到新SOTA，在图像描述、视觉定位和多目标检测任务上取得显著提升

Conclusion: 生成过程与数据内在结构的对齐是解锁复杂地理空间分析中卓越性能的关键

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）在计算机视觉中仍是一个难题，需要探索更有效的训练策略来提升性能。

Method: 使用两阶段训练策略：1）自监督预训练阶段通过着色任务学习通用视觉表示；2）微调阶段进行4倍超分辨率，通过预测高频残差图像简化残差学习。

Result: 在DIV2K基准数据集上，ViT-SR实现了SSIM 0.712和PSNR 22.90 dB的优异结果。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练策略有效，自监督预训练对复杂图像恢复任务具有潜力，未来可通过更大ViT架构或替代预训练任务进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Conclusion: Noisy Query Tokens方法有效解决了MLLMs中VLM与扩散模型桥接时的任务泛化问题，通过分布式表示学习和细节恢复机制实现了更好的持续学习性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的两步加速方案，通过分析VGGT和π³模型中全局注意力模块的作用，将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，并对全局注意力进行子采样，实现了8-10倍的推理速度提升，同时保持或略微提高原始模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如VGGT和π³虽然具有强大的多视角3D性能，但严重依赖全局自注意力导致计算成本高昂。现有的稀疏注意力变体只能部分加速，缺乏对全局注意力在多视角推理中作用的系统性分析。

Method: 1. 深入分析VGGT和π³中全局注意力模块的作用；2. 提出训练免费的两步加速方案：将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，通过子采样K/V对全局注意力进行子采样，保留对角线并添加均值填充组件。

Conclusion: 通过系统性分析全局注意力的作用并设计相应的加速策略，可以在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为多视角3D推理模型的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Conclusion: OmniPerson为行人重识别提供了高质量的数据增强解决方案，具有身份一致性和高度可控性，将开源代码、模型和数据集。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Conclusion: Panel2Patch通过保留局部语义和构建多粒度监督，为生物医学视觉语言模型提供了更有效的预训练方法。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过扩散模型和运动图检索有效解决了语音手势视频生成的挑战，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: 通过将纹理映射与高斯泼溅相结合，实现了对场景外观细节的更有效表示，在保持高质量渲染的同时减少了参数需求。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench的见解将促进推理感知视频生成的进一步发展，推动视频生成模型向视觉基础智能迈进。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Motivation: 在多媒体制作中，需要对每个声源单独处理音频轨道以实现精确编辑和创意控制，但现有方法由于视觉特征纠缠和提示不明确，只能一次性生成混合声音。

Method: SelVA模型将文本提示作为目标声源的显式选择器，通过调制视频编码器提取与提示相关的视频特征，使用补充令牌抑制文本无关的激活，并采用自增强方案解决单声道音频监督数据不足的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面均表现有效。

Conclusion: SelVA为多媒体制作提供了精确的声源选择性生成能力，通过创新的特征调制和自增强技术解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

### [67] [Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660)
*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合架构，将视觉语言模型（如ColPali）的补丁级相似性得分与OCR提取的区域相结合，用于精确的文档区域检索，以提升检索增强生成的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然能实现细粒度的相似性计算，但返回的是整个页面而非特定区域，限制了在检索增强生成中的应用。而OCR系统虽然能提取带坐标的结构化文本，但缺乏语义相关性评估能力。

Method: 提出混合架构：利用ColPali的补丁级相似性得分作为空间相关性过滤器，应用于OCR提取的区域。形式化视觉变换器补丁网格与OCR边界框之间的坐标映射，引入交集度量进行相关性传播，并建立检索精度的理论界限。该方法在推理时运行，无需额外训练。

Result: 开发了开源实现Snappy，展示了实际应用性，并正在进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 该混合方法结合了视觉语言模型的语义理解能力和OCR的结构化提取优势，为检索增强生成提供了更精确的上下文检索解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

*Derui Shan,Qian Qiao,Hao Lu,Tao Du,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR是一种将偏振先验直接嵌入3D高斯溅射优化的新框架，通过偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制，实现了高精度反射分离和全场景重建，无需环境贴图或材料假设，同时保持实时渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如基于NeRF的偏振感知方法训练缓慢、渲染效率低且依赖材料/视角假设，而3DGS虽然能实时渲染但在反射重建方面存在反射-几何纠缠问题，添加延迟反射模块又引入环境贴图依赖。

Method: 提出偏振前向引导范式，建立偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制：首先利用3DGS的几何先验解决偏振模糊性，然后使用精炼的偏振信息引导3DGS的法线和球谐表示。

Result: 在公开和自采集数据集上验证，PolarGuide-GSDR在镜面反射重建、法线估计和新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架，为复杂反射场景建模提供了优越的可解释性和实时性能。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反无人机跟踪研究缺乏统一的跨模态协作框架，多模态数据融合效果不佳，需要一种能够有效整合RGB、TIR和RGB-T等多种模态的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于单流、单阶段、端到端架构构建UAUTrack框架，引入文本先验提示策略指导模型在不同场景下专注于无人机目标。

Result: 在Anti-UAV和DUT Anti-UAV数据集上达到最先进性能，在Anti-UAV410数据集上保持精度与速度的良好平衡。

Conclusion: UAUTrack在多种反无人机场景中表现出高精度和实用效率，为跨模态无人机跟踪提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR是一种轻量级扩散超分辨率方法，通过相位信息引导的渐进式剪枝减少扩散模型的冗余计算，在保持恢复质量的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。

Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散模型的超分辨率方法（如SDXL和DiT）计算和内存成本过高的问题，通过去除扩散模型中的冗余信息来实现高效图像超分辨率。

Method: 1. 识别扩散主干网络中的块内冗余，提出渐进式剪枝方法去除冗余块但保留恢复能力；2. 设计相位交换适配器模块，利用输入图像的相位信息引导剪枝后的扩散模型获得更好的恢复性能；3. 将渐进式剪枝和相位交换适配器统一为一个完整模型。

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR通过相位信息引导的模型剪枝和适配器设计，成功平衡了扩散模型超分辨率的性能与效率，为轻量级扩散模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Motivation: 现有槽注意力方法对前景和背景区域不加区分处理，导致背景干扰和真实世界数据上实例发现性能不佳。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过双槽竞争机制粗粒度分解场景；第二阶段引入掩码槽注意力，第一个槽捕获背景，其余槽竞争表示前景对象，并使用伪掩码指导避免过分割。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，FASA一致优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 显式前景建模和伪掩码指导对于鲁棒的场景分解和对象一致性表示是有效的。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ClimaDrive是一个语义引导的图像到图像框架，用于合成语义一致、天气多样且物理合理的异常驾驶数据，通过统一结构引导的多天气生成和提示驱动的异常修复，创建视觉逼真的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常分割在开放世界环境中面临异常数据稀缺和多样性有限的问题，现有方法通过合成数据生成但缺乏上下文一致性和物理真实性，导致合成数据与真实数据之间存在领域差距。

Method: 提出ClimaDrive框架，结合结构引导的多天气生成和提示驱动的异常修复，构建ClimaOoD大规模基准数据集，涵盖六种代表性驾驶场景在晴朗和恶劣天气条件下的数据。

Result: 在四种最先进方法上的实验表明，使用ClimaOoD训练显著提高了异常分割性能，AUROC、AP和FPR95均有明显提升，其中RbA在Fishyscapes LAF上的FPR95从3.97降至3.52。

Conclusion: ClimaOoD增强了模型的鲁棒性，为开放世界异常检测提供了有价值的训练数据，实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

TL;DR: GeoBridge是一个基础模型，通过跨视图双向匹配和语言到图像检索来解决跨视图地理定位问题，突破了传统卫星中心范式的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卫星中心的地理定位方法在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性不足，且未能充分利用跨视图（如无人机、卫星、街景）和多模态（如语言和图像）的互补线索。

Method: 提出基于语义锚点机制的新方法，通过文本描述桥接多视图特征，实现鲁棒灵活的地理定位。构建了首个大规模跨模态多视图对齐数据集GeoLoc（包含5万对图像和文本描述）。

Result: 实验证实GeoLoc预训练显著提高了GeoBridge的地理定位准确性，同时促进了跨领域泛化和跨模态知识转移。

Conclusion: GeoBridge模型通过创新的语义锚点机制和高质量数据集，有效解决了跨视图地理定位的挑战，为多模态地理定位研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner是一种无需训练的视觉语言模型剪枝算法，通过平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，在保持88.9%剪枝率的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的剪枝方法仅关注token重要性而忽略token间冗余性，导致保留大量重复token；同时现有冗余感知方法忽视token空间关系，导致保留token分布过于稀疏无法充分覆盖目标物体区域

Method: 提出离心式token剪枝范式实现近远距离选择，优先保留细粒度物体细节；设计空间稀疏性缓冲准则延迟选择空间距离较远的token；采用并行贪心策略高效进行token选择；选择性融合被剪枝token的显著信息到保留token中

Result: 在5种VLMs上的综合比较表明，VLM-Pruner在88.9%剪枝率下始终优于强基线方法，同时实现端到端推理加速

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner通过显式平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，有效解决了现有剪枝方法的局限性，为移动设备部署提供了高效的视觉语言模型压缩方案

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Conclusion: 使用两种组织掩膜的图像配准方法显著改善了UK Biobank全身图像的配准质量

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

Conclusion: GeoViS框架在检测微小目标的同时保持整体场景感知，展现出强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba框架能有效处理手部遮挡问题，在3D手部姿态估计中达到最先进性能，且推理速度与ResNet-50相当

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Jiangbei Yue,Guangliang Cheng,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种推理感知的多模态融合框架（RAMF），用于检测视频中的仇恨言论，通过局部-全局上下文融合和语义交叉注意力机制解决多模态语义融合问题，并引入对抗性推理来理解细微的仇恨意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频中的仇恨言论对数字平台构成严重威胁，现有方法难以有效融合多模态间的复杂语义关系，且缺乏对细微仇恨内容的理解能力。

Method: 提出RAMF框架，包含局部-全局上下文融合（LGCF）捕获局部显著线索和全局时间结构，语义交叉注意力（SCA）实现细粒度多模态语义交互，以及对抗性推理（三阶段过程：客观描述、仇恨假设推理、非仇恨假设推理）来丰富对仇恨意图的上下文理解。

Result: 在两个真实世界仇恨视频数据集上的评估显示，该方法在Macro-F1和仇恨类召回率上分别比最先进方法提高了3%和7%，表现出强大的泛化性能。

Conclusion: RAMF框架能有效解决视频仇恨言论检测中的多模态融合和细微意图理解问题，具有显著的性能提升和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet是一种基于注意力机制的深度学习框架，用于Sentinel-2卫星图像中的甲烷羽流检测，通过融合NDMI指数和注意力增强U-Net，在降低误报率的同时提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，准确检测甲烷排放对应对气候变化至关重要。传统方法依赖波段差异且误报率高，现有深度学习方法缺乏对甲烷特定特征的关注机制。

Method: 提出甲烷感知架构，将归一化甲烷差异指数(NDMI)与注意力增强U-Net融合，使用焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题，并在真实甲烷羽流数据集上训练。

Result: 实验表明AttMetNet在甲烷羽流检测中优于现有方法，具有更低的误报率、更好的精确度-召回率平衡和更高的IoU指标。

Conclusion: AttMetNet建立了首个针对真实卫星图像中甲烷羽流检测的专用架构，通过注意力机制选择性放大甲烷吸收特征，有效抑制背景噪声。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种烟雾类型感知的腹腔镜视频去烟网络（STANet），通过区分扩散烟雾和环境烟雾两种类型，实现了更精准的手术烟雾去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去烟方法未能考虑不同类型烟雾的时空特性差异，而手术烟雾会严重影响腹腔镜手术的视觉引导。

Method: 设计了烟雾掩码分割子网络和去烟视频重建子网络，引入粗到细的解缠模块来处理两种烟雾类型的纠缠问题，并构建了首个大规模带烟雾类型标注的合成数据集。

Result: 实验表明该方法在质量评估上优于现有最先进方法，并在多个下游手术任务中表现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: STANet通过烟雾类型感知的方法有效解决了腹腔镜视频去烟问题，为手术视觉引导提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成多个内在属性时缺乏结构一致性和物理一致性的问题，提供更全面和连贯的场景描述。

Method: 提出Query-Broadcast Attention机制确保结构一致性，以及Tensor LoRA参数高效建模跨图关系，实现稳定的联合扩散训练。

Result: 实验表明LumiX在连贯性和物理意义方面优于现有技术，对齐度提高23%，偏好得分更好（0.19 vs -0.41），并能进行图像条件的内在分解。

Conclusion: LumiX通过结构化设计实现了多内在属性的联合生成，在保持物理一致性的同时显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5提出了一种结合运动方向解耦和残差驱动时空细化的新架构，显著提升了小物体跟踪性能，在保持实时推理能力的同时实现了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TrackNet系列在遮挡处理和运动方向模糊方面的局限性，特别是V4版本因绝对差分方法丢失运动极性信息导致的方向模糊问题。

Method: 1. 运动方向解耦模块：将时间动态分解为带符号的极性场，显式编码运动发生和轨迹方向；2. 残差驱动时空细化头：基于Transformer的模块，利用因子化的时空上下文估计校正残差，有效恢复遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上实现F1分数0.9859和准确率0.9733的新SOTA，相比V4仅增加3.7%的计算量，保持了实时推理能力。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5通过引入方向感知的运动表示和精细的时空细化机制，显著提升了跟踪性能，为快速运动小物体跟踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型与闭源模型性能差距日益扩大，主要原因是缺乏大规模高质量训练数据和能够诊断模型弱点的综合基准测试。现有数据构建方法面临规模与质量的权衡问题。

Method: 引入轻量级数据管道，用端到端模型替代多工具链，并加入统一的后验证阶段。训练7B双任务专家模型Qwen-Verify进行失败检测和指令重标注，构建了10M规模的UnicEdit-10M数据集。

Result: 构建了UnicEdit-10M数据集和UnicBench基准测试，提出了新的评估指标（非编辑一致性和推理准确性），并在主流模型上进行了分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为多模态图像编辑模型提供了高质量的数据资源和评估工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HUD的新型组合视频检索框架，通过利用视频和文本模态之间的信息密度差异来解决修改主题指代模糊和细节语义关注有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合视频检索方法忽视了视频和文本模态之间的信息密度差异，导致修改主题指代模糊和细节语义关注不足，影响检索性能。

Method: 提出HUD框架，包含三个关键组件：整体代词消歧、原子不确定性建模和整体到原子的对齐，通过跨模态交互实现精确的组合特征学习。

Result: HUD在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，不仅适用于组合视频检索，也适用于组合图像检索任务。

Conclusion: HUD是首个利用视频-文本信息密度差异的框架，能有效解决多模态查询理解中的关键问题，提升检索精度。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

Motivation: 解决共享世界建模问题，即从一组输入图像生成多个相机视角下具有一致底层世界的视频，现有方法在场景几何和物体运动一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出IC-World框架，利用大视频模型的上下文生成能力进行并行视频生成，并通过Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习算法和两个新的奖励模型（场景几何一致性和物体运动一致性）进行微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，IC-World在几何一致性和运动一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统探索基于视频的世界模型在共享世界建模问题上的工作，IC-World框架在保持多视角一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCustom是一个用于扩散模型的微调框架，通过两个新的正则化损失（等距损失和解耦损失）来实现物理概念的定制化生成，解决了现有方法在物理属性定制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在理解具体概念（如风格和形状）方面取得了成功，但在物理概念的定制方面存在挑战。主要问题是训练过程中缺乏明确的物理知识引入，导致即使输入文本提示包含物理相关词汇，生成结果也无法准确反映相应的物理属性。

Method: 提出PhyCustom框架，包含两个新颖的正则化损失：1）等距损失（isometric loss）旨在激活扩散模型学习物理概念；2）解耦损失（decouple loss）帮助消除独立概念的混合学习。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理概念定制方面在定量和定性上都优于先前的最先进和流行方法。

Conclusion: PhyCustom通过引入专门的物理知识正则化损失，有效提升了扩散模型在物理概念定制方面的能力，填补了当前方法在物理属性控制方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: 探索对抗性训练对对抗样本可迁移性的影响，因为目前这方面研究不足

Method: 训练了36个不同的模型（包括CNN和ViT），并进行全面的可迁移性实验

Result: 发现对抗性训练模型产生的扰动比标准模型更易迁移，存在明显的悖论

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估不仅应关注模型对迁移攻击的抵抗力，还应评估其产生可迁移对抗样本的倾向性

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

Motivation: 现有方法将复杂推理（动态、因果关系、时序交互）简化为潜在嵌入的隐式推理，导致推理链不透明且难以追踪。需要显式分解推理过程以提高可解释性和性能。

Method: 采用三步显式推理操作：1）语义解释；2）时序证据选择；3）空间定位。在预训练VLM基础上使用强化学习优化多步推理链，实现自我精炼。

Result: 在标准视频目标分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，并产生可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 显式分解推理过程结合强化学习优化，能够有效处理复杂推理任务，提高模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: 多模态单帧动作预测方法AAG能够有效替代视频时序聚合，实现高效的动作预测

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像编辑器能生成身份保持的AI生成内容（IP-AIGC），即同一人物在不同服装、背景或光照下的图像。当前检测器在此场景下的鲁棒性和公平性尚不明确，特别是对少数族裔群体。

Method: 使用FairFD和HAV-DF构建印度焦点训练集，并利用Gemini和ChatGPT等商业生成器创建两个IP-AIGC测试集。评估AIDE和Effort两种先进检测器在预训练和微调下的性能。

Result: 微调虽在训练域内表现提升（如Effort AUC从0.739升至0.944），但在印度群体的IP-AIGC测试集上性能显著下降（如AIDE AUC从0.923降至0.563），表明模型过拟合于训练生成器的特征。

Conclusion: 研究确立了IP-AIGC-印度检测作为具有挑战性的实际场景，呼吁开发保持泛化能力的适应方法和印度感知的基准数据集以缩小检测泛化差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但其部署受到高计算成本和需要多次推理步骤的限制。现有的少步蒸馏方法往往存在重训练成本高和泛化能力下降的问题。

Method: 采用阶段感知策略，使用两个专门处理慢速和快速去噪阶段的专家（Slow-LoRA和Fast-LoRA），通过轻量级LoRA适配器实现智能加速，而不是均匀地加速所有步骤。

Result: 该方法在基础模型上实现了高达5倍的加速，同时在多样化基准测试中保持可比的视觉质量。LoRA专家仅需1个样本在单张V100上训练1小时即可获得强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过阶段感知的LoRA适配器策略，可以在极低的训练成本下实现扩散模型的高效加速，同时保持良好的生成质量和泛化性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Conclusion: MRD框架能够有效解决高分辨率图像理解中的语义相似性偏差问题，通过多分辨率融合和对象检测技术提高了目标对象定位的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 大量实验表明DiverseAR在基于比特的自回归图像生成中显著提升了样本多样性。

Conclusion: DiverseAR是解决比特自回归模型多样性问题的有效方法，能够在保持视觉质量的同时增强生成样本的多样性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Motivation: 现有方法存在明显缺陷：3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽然渲染质量高但多视角一致性差，2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）保证了多视角一致性却牺牲了纹理细节。需要一种能平衡外观质量和几何精度的解决方案。

Method: 提出Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS)，包含三个核心技术：1）混合高斯光栅化实现统一渲染；2）自适应类型交换机制动态调整2D/3D高斯；3）频率解耦优化策略充分发挥各自优势。采用CUDA加速确保效率。

Conclusion: EGGS通过巧妙融合2D和3D高斯的优势，成功解决了新视角合成中的外观-几何权衡问题，代表了该领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型的毒性分数分别达到4.73和4.83，攻击成功率分别达到86.31%和91.07%。

Conclusion: 视觉模态本身是破解先进MLLM的有效载体，CIA方法显著优于现有工作，证明了图像在攻击中的重要作用。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Result: 在通用和幻觉基准测试中取得4%-27%的性能提升，表现出强大的鲁棒性

Conclusion: InEx框架有效缓解了MLLMs中的幻觉问题，为开发可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了新思路

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Conclusion: U4D框架通过不确定性感知和分阶段生成策略，有效解决了4D LiDAR世界建模中的几何保真度和时间一致性问题，为自动驾驶和具身AI提供了更可靠的环境建模方法。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.

Conclusion: DynamicVerse框架在4D建模方面实现了比现有方法更好的全局精度，能够更准确地捕捉物理尺度测量。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

Result: 在合成和真实场景的LiDAR点云补全任务中，该方法优于之前的重建方法。

Conclusion: SurfFill通过结合LiDAR和相机优势，有效解决了点云补全问题，特别适用于大规模重建场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA在编辑保真度和精确运动保持之间实现了稳健平衡，展示了高质量的视频编辑效果。

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效改善视频处理的时间稳定性，同时保持或提升预测质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Result: 在三个MRI数据集上的实验表明，FLAT比扩散模型减少3倍迭代次数，比展开网络显著提高稳定性

Conclusion: 流ODE与展开网络的数学关联为MRI重建提供了理论基础，FLAT方法实现了高质量重建与计算效率的平衡

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

TL;DR: Video4Spatial框架证明仅使用视频数据的视频生成模型能够执行复杂的空间任务，包括场景导航和物体定位，无需深度或姿态等辅助模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够仅通过视觉数据展现人类认知核心的视觉空间智能。

Method: 提出Video4Spatial框架，通过视频扩散模型仅基于视频场景上下文执行空间任务，包括场景导航（遵循相机姿态指令并保持3D几何一致性）和物体定位（需要语义定位、指令遵循和规划）。

Result: 模型能够端到端规划导航和定位目标物体，遵循相机姿态指令同时保持空间一致性，并能泛化到长上下文和域外环境。

Conclusion: 这些结果推动了视频生成模型向通用视觉空间推理的发展。

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Motivation: 当前视频生成技术擅长生成单镜头片段，但在生成叙事性多镜头视频方面存在困难，需要灵活的镜头安排、连贯的叙事和超越文本提示的可控性。

Method: 提出MultiShotMaster框架，扩展预训练单镜头模型，集成两种新型RoPE变体：多镜头叙事RoPE（在镜头转换时应用显式相位偏移）和时空位置感知RoPE（结合参考标记和接地信号）。建立自动数据标注流程以克服数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

TL;DR: PPTArena是一个PowerPoint编辑基准测试，专注于对真实幻灯片进行基于自然语言指令的可靠修改。PPTPilot是一个结构感知的幻灯片编辑智能体，在复杂编辑任务中表现优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PPT编辑工具主要关注图像-PDF渲染或文本到幻灯片生成，缺乏对真实幻灯片进行可靠、精确的in-place编辑的能力。需要建立一个全面的基准来评估PPT编辑系统的性能。

Method: PPTArena包含100个演示文稿、2125张幻灯片和800多个目标编辑任务。PPTPilot采用结构感知的编辑方法，通过计划语义编辑序列、在高层次程序化工具和确定性XML操作之间路由，并使用迭代的计划-编辑-检查循环来验证输出。

Result: PPTPilot在复合编辑、布局敏感编辑和跨幻灯片编辑任务中比现有专有智能体和前沿VLM系统高出10个百分点以上，在视觉保真度和整体一致性方面表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 尽管PPTPilot取得了显著改进，现有智能体在PPTArena的长时程、文档级任务上仍然表现不佳，这表明可靠的PPT编辑仍然面临挑战。

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

Motivation: 现有方法通常为不同任务训练独立模型，将图像和视频推理视为独立领域，限制了向多模态推理通用模型的可扩展性，阻碍了跨任务和模态的知识共享。

Method: 构建OneThinker-600k训练语料覆盖多种视觉任务，使用商业模型进行思维链标注得到SFT冷启动数据，并提出EMA-GRPO算法处理多任务RL中的奖励异质性。

Result: 在31个基准测试和10个基础视觉理解任务上表现出强大性能，展现出有效的任务间知识迁移和初步的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OneThinker标志着向统一多模态推理通用模型迈出的重要一步，所有代码、模型和数据均已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

TL;DR: CAMEO是一种训练多视角扩散模型的新方法，通过监督注意力图来增强几何对应关系，从而提高训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视角变化较大时几何对应关系准确性下降，导致生成质量降低。

Method: 通过直接监督注意力图来增强几何对应关系，仅需监督单个注意力层即可引导模型学习精确对应。

Result: CAMEO将训练迭代次数减半，同时在不同迭代次数下均实现更优性能，且具有模型无关性。

Conclusion: CAMEO是一种简单有效的训练技术，能显著提升多视角扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

Result: 实验证明该分层方法有效解决了用户意图差距问题，为创作者提供直接直观的生成过程控制

Conclusion: 分层组合范式成功弥合了扩散模型的语义能力与传统图形软件的精细控制之间的鸿沟

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在安全关键任务中易受对抗攻击影响，现有黑盒攻击方法使用的简单矩形区域扰动效果有限，需要更强大的攻击方法来开发更有效的防御机制。

Method: 提出Superpixel Attack方法：1）使用超像素作为扰动区域，平衡颜色方差和紧凑性；2）引入多样化搜索策略；3）结合超像素和多样化搜索进行对抗攻击。

Result: 相比现有攻击方法，Superpixel Attack平均提高了2.10%的攻击成功率，在对抗鲁棒性较强的模型上表现显著。

Conclusion: Superpixel Attack为黑盒对抗攻击提供了更有效的解决方案，有助于提升模型的安全性和鲁棒性评估，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models are used in safety-critical tasks such as automated driving and face recognition. However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks. Most models used in this study are robust against adversarial attacks, and this improvement is significant for black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 视觉相似性仍然是可行的反钓鱼措施，本地推理过程确保了用户隐私和低延迟

Abstract: Phishing remains one of the most prevalent online threats, exploiting human trust to harvest sensitive credentials. Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

Abstract: Wearable sensors, such as smartwatches, have become increasingly prevalent across domains like healthcare, sports, and education, enabling continuous monitoring of physiological and behavioral data. In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.

Method: 采用心理物理学范式，构建BayesBench行为基准（包含4个文本和图像的量级估计任务），通过控制噪声、上下文和指令提示的消融实验，评估9种LLMs的多模态线索整合性能。

Result: 研究发现能力强的模型常以贝叶斯一致的方式适应，但准确性不能保证鲁棒性。GPT-5 Mini文本准确率完美但视觉线索整合效率低，揭示了能力与策略的关键分离。

Conclusion: 准确性中心的基准可能过度关注性能而忽略脆弱的不确定性处理，研究结果揭示了LLMs对不确定性的原则性处理能力，并发布了心理物理学基准和一致性度量作为评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

Conclusion: 早期治疗后扩散MRI比治疗前成像具有更好的预后价值，结合MRI、临床和病灶体积特征可构建稳健且可解释的AIS患者三个月功能结局预测框架。

Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

Abstract: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人抓取模仿学习在多目标场景中存在多模态问题：当场景包含多个有效目标时，对不同物体的抓取演示会产生冲突的训练信号，导致标准模仿学习策略平均这些不同动作而产生无效动作。

Method: 利用冻结的SAM2模型的强大视觉时序跟踪能力，引入轻量级可训练动作头与其原生分割头并行工作。仅训练小型动作头在预计算的SAM2时序视觉特征上。推理时通过初始提示（如边界框）指定特定抓取对象，条件化动作头预测唯一明确的抓取轨迹。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，SAM2Grasp在杂乱多目标抓取任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这种时序提示方法有效消除了视觉运动策略中的歧义，为多目标抓取任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

TL;DR: F2D2是一个联合蒸馏框架，将基于流的生成模型的采样和似然评估所需的神经网络评估次数减少两个数量级，解决了传统方法在加速采样时放弃似然计算或需要昂贵轨迹积分的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的生成模型（如扩散模型和基于流的模型）需要数百到数千次神经网络评估来计算单个似然值，这严重限制了模型比较、微调目标实现和下游应用的能力。

Method: 提出快速流联合蒸馏（F2D2）框架，利用连续归一化流中采样和似然计算的耦合ODE共享底层速度场的特点，通过单个模型联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，仅需添加一个散度预测头。

Result: 实验表明F2D2能够在少量步数评估下实现准确的log-likelihood计算，同时保持高样本质量，解决了基于流生成模型的长期计算瓶颈。

Conclusion: F2D2是模块化框架，与现有的基于流的少步采样模型兼容，其应用包括轻量级自引导方法，使2步MeanFlow模型仅需一次额外反向NFE就能超越1024步教师模型。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合道路网络数据和卫星图像的多模态方法，用于分析交通事故模式，通过整合视觉和网络嵌入特征显著提升了事故预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通事故预测研究主要依赖道路网络结构特征，而忽视了道路表面及周围环境的物理和环境信息，导致预测精度受限。

Method: 构建了一个覆盖美国六个州的大型多模态数据集，包含900万条交通事故记录和100万张高分辨率卫星图像，结合天气统计、道路类型和交通流量等信息，评估了整合视觉和网络嵌入的多模态学习方法。

Result: 多模态学习方法将预测准确率提升至平均AUROC 90.1%，比仅使用图结构的图神经网络模型提高了3.7%。因果分析显示，降水增加使事故率上升24%，高速公路等高速道路事故率上升22%，季节性模式导致事故率上升29%。

Conclusion: 卫星图像特征对于实现准确预测至关重要，多模态数据整合能显著提升交通事故模式分析的性能。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在感知、语言、推理和多模态领域取得快速进展，但现代AI系统在自我监控、自我纠正和自主行为调节方面存在根本性限制，需要识别这些缺陷并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过比较分析人工系统与生物认知，整合AI研究、认知科学和神经科学的见解，识别七大核心缺陷并探讨基于神经认知原理的架构解决方案。

Result: 识别出当前AI模型的七大缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、元认知意识缺失、固定非自适应学习机制、无法重构目标、缺乏表征维护、不足的具身反馈、缺乏内在能动性。

Conclusion: 需要向认知自主的AI范式转变，实现自我导向适应、动态表征管理和意向性目标导向行为，同时配备改革性监督机制确保系统可解释、可治理并与人类价值观对齐。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ReMindView-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在多视图空间推理中的表现，发现现有模型在跨视图对齐和视角转换方面存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理中缺乏几何一致性和跨视图一致性，需要专门的基准测试来隔离多视图推理与单视图感知和时间因素。

Method: 构建ReMindView-Bench基准，系统变化视角空间模式和查询类型；使用显性分析（LLM作为评判员和自我一致性提示）和隐性分析（线性探测和熵动态）来诊断模型推理过程。

Result: 评估15个当前VLMs显示，模型在单帧感知表现良好，但在跨视图信息整合时性能急剧下降；隐性分析显示任务相关信息逐渐丢失，正确与错误轨迹之间的不确定性分离。

Conclusion: 研究为VLM空间推理提供了认知基础诊断，揭示了多视图空间心智模型在推理过程中的形成、退化和失稳机制，为改进模型的空间推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

TL;DR: Material Coating是一种新的图像编辑任务，模拟在物体表面施加薄材料层同时保留其几何细节。与现有材料替换方法不同，该方法通过CoatFusion架构和DataCoat110K数据集实现可控的材料涂层效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料转移方法会覆盖物体的精细几何细节，无法实现真实的薄层材料涂层效果。需要一种新方法来模拟真实世界中的材料涂层过程。

Method: 构建包含11万张图像的DataCoat110K合成数据集，提出CoatFusion架构，基于扩散模型并利用2D反照率纹理和PBR参数（粗糙度、金属度、透射率、厚度）进行条件控制。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，CoatFusion能够生成真实可控的材料涂层效果，在新任务上显著优于现有的材料编辑和转移方法。

Conclusion: Material Coating是一个有前景的新任务，CoatFusion方法通过参数化控制和扩散模型成功实现了高质量的薄层材料涂层效果。

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

Conclusion: SMP提供了一种可重用、任务无关的运动先验方法，显著提高了运动先验的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20
