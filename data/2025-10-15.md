TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量的方法，重点解决压缩引起的视差图噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球月球探索活动增加，需要高质量3D月球地图，特别是NASA的Endurance任务需要穿越2000公里。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球覆盖但存在高度不准确问题

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式，提出减少压缩图像视差图中残余噪声的方法

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效减少高程噪声，提高未来月球任务地形数据的安全性和可靠性

Conclusion: 该方法能显著改善3D月球地图质量，为长距离月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过控制实验对比CLIP和DINO作为视觉编码器的性能差异，发现CLIP的优势主要来自语言监督而非训练数据规模，CLIP擅长文本密集型任务，DINO在视觉中心任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了厘清CLIP相比自监督模型DINO在视觉语言模型中表现更好的原因——是语言监督的作用还是训练数据规模的差异。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO模型，达到相似的ImageNet准确率，然后分析它们的嵌入特征并集成到视觉语言模型中进行20个VQA基准测试。

Result: CLIP捕捉高层次语义特征（如物体类别、文本），DINO对低层次特征（如颜色、风格）更敏感；CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务上略有优势；语言监督的变体带来有限改进。

Conclusion: CLIP的优势主要源于语言监督，这为视觉编码器设计及其对视觉语言模型性能的影响提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在乳腺癌筛查任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用视觉领域取得成功，但在医学影像中应用有限，主要受限于数据量不足和领域特定偏差。乳腺X线摄影领域缺乏大规模标注数据，需要开发不依赖标注的预训练方法。

Method: 提出MammoDINO框架，包含：1）乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器，支持图像级和补丁级监督；2）跨切片对比学习目标，将3D数字乳腺断层合成结构信息融入2D预训练；3）在140万张乳腺X线图像上进行预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务上达到最先进性能，在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的基础框架，可用于开发多用途的乳腺X线计算机辅助诊断工具，有助于减轻放射科医生工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型框架，利用VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL的互补优势，通过任务特定优化来提升交通安全视频分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安全分析需要复杂的视频理解能力来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故，但现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用分离训练策略，让VideoLLaMA专门负责时间推理（视频描述），Qwen2.5-VL专门负责视觉理解（视觉问答），最小化任务干扰。

Result: 在WTS数据集上，VideoLLaMA获得CIDEr得分1.1001，Qwen2.5-VL获得VQA准确率60.80%，在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2中排名第10位（S2得分45.7572）。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持描述质量，证明了双模型框架在交通安全分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net是一种新颖的模型，通过单张全景图像估计房间3D布局，结合CNN和TPS空间变换，能够有效处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在计算机视觉中至关重要，可应用于机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：CNN提取图像特征并学习TPS变换参数，TPS层基于预测参数将参考布局变换为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 模型在房间布局估计中表现出高精度，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，且能鲁棒处理各种布局类型。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门的空间推理框架，通过在输入提示中嵌入边界框坐标来增强对仓库环境中空间关系的理解，在AI City Challenge 2025中取得了第四名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在大规模3D仓库环境中面临场景杂乱、遮挡和需要精确空间理解的挑战，模型依赖局部外观特征而缺乏显式空间基础，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）嵌入输入提示中，使模型能够推理物体几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行任务特定监督的微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案以提高评估一致性。

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得最终得分73.0606，排名第四。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，模型决策的可理解性直接影响临床信任和采用。虽然Vision Transformers在诊断影像中表现出色，但其复杂的注意力机制对可解释性构成挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM方法，对ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同架构进行定量和定性分析，应用于外周血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类判别性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO+Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，本研究支持将ViTs可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APGNet网络，通过自适应先验引导机制解决水下伪装目标检测的两大挑战：图像退化和生物伪装问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在低对比度、颜色失真等退化问题，且海洋生物具有天然伪装特性，传统图像增强方法和陆地场景的COD方法难以适应水下环境

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合MSRCR算法进行数据增强，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制分层融合位置和边界先验

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在常用评估指标上优于15种最先进方法

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效提升了水下伪装目标检测的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VidMP3方法，通过利用姿态和位置先验学习源视频的通用运动表示，实现保持原始运动的同时允许结构和语义灵活性的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频编辑方法在结构保持任务上表现良好，但在结构可变编辑中存在时序不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题，需要更灵活的运动保持视频编辑方法。

Method: VidMP3利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习通用运动表示，生成保持原始运动的新视频，同时允许结构和语义的灵活性。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，代码将在GitHub上公开。

Conclusion: VidMP3为解决运动保持视频编辑中的挑战提供了一种有效方法，在保持运动一致性的同时实现了结构和语义的灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Result: 通过领域自适应方法，可以在数据稀缺的情况下获得与基准结果相当的性能。

Conclusion: 领域自适应是解决标注数据稀缺问题的有效途径，能够扩展模型的应用范围。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对QR码去模糊的自适应双网络框架，包含用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，通过边缘引导注意力块显式利用QR码的结构先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码的高度结构化模式和锐利边缘先验，而QR码去模糊的关键是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB)将边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer处理严重模糊；设计轻量级LENet处理轻度模糊；整合为Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet)根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重模糊QR码的解码率上显著提升，同时保持竞争性速度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过显式利用QR码结构先验和自适应网络选择，实现了高效且有效的QR码去模糊，特别适合资源受限的移动设备。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用平面结构生成精确深度图的方法，通过几何引导来改进3D场景重建，特别是在未观测区域取得了更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏可靠的几何监督，难以在观测区域和未观测区域产生高质量重建，且存在多视角不一致性问题。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，将几何引导整合到生成流程中，改进可见性掩码估计、引导新视角选择，并使用视频扩散模型增强多视角一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法支持单视图输入和无位姿视频，在室内外场景中具有良好的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

### [15] [DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107)
*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为DRL的判别式表示学习框架，通过轻量级适配器IPA网络和解耦锚监督DAS来解决非排练类增量学习中的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示漂移和局部优化与全局推理不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中表现出色，但仍面临三个关键挑战：模型复杂度不断增加、增量学习过程中表示漂移不平稳、阶段优化与全局推理不一致。

Method: 1. 使用IPA网络（增量并行适配器）在预训练模型基础上逐步添加轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现表示能力的继承和传播；2. 设计DAS（解耦锚监督）通过虚拟锚点分别约束正负样本，促进判别性表示学习。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个CIL周期中始终优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过IPA网络和DAS机制有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了平滑的表示迁移和优化的对齐，为高效的非排练类增量学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

TL;DR: SSDiff是一种自监督选择性引导扩散方法，通过伪参考人脸和区域特定修复来解决老照片人脸修复中的复合退化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影和面部颜色问题

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型生成伪参考人脸，通过分阶段监督（结构引导和颜色细化）和选择性修复（结合人脸解析图和划痕掩码）

Result: 在新建的VintageFace基准测试中，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导机制有效解决了老照片人脸修复的挑战

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: ImageSentinel是一个保护视觉数据集在检索增强图像生成系统中免受未经授权使用的新框架，通过合成哨兵图像来检测数据集滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛使用引发了对私有图像数据集未经授权使用的担忧，传统数字水印方法在这种复杂系统中效果有限。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥来实现保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束优化的编码函数设计方法，用于改进压缩单光子3D成像系统在硬件限制下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率等）的挑战，现有压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 采用梯度下降法联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保编码函数符合硬件约束条件，并能够适应任意参数化的脉冲响应函数。

Result: 通过大量仿真验证，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下均优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升压缩单光子3D成像系统在实际硬件约束下的性能，并具有良好的适应性。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: 当前开源模型在通用视觉caption任务上与商业模型存在较大性能差距，限制了数据合成等应用的发展。

Method: 提出CapFlow多智能体协作工作流，将其作为数据合成器大规模生成高质量视觉caption，并通过微调获得通用视觉caption模型MetaCaptioner。

Result: MetaCaptioner在caption能力上与商业模型相当，在开源社区达到顶级多模态性能。

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉caption解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习环境下的隐私保护、数据异构性和标签缺失问题，为远程生理测量提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: KFF方法通过知识融合与分裂机制解决持续测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘和知识干扰问题，在ImageNet-C数据集上验证了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在减少灾难性遗忘的同时，往往导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降

Method: 提出类感知域知识融合与分裂方法KFF，包含知识分裂模块(KFI)分离新域知识，知识融合模块(KFU)合并新旧知识，采用贪心动态合并策略

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法相对于其他方法的有效性

Conclusion: KFF方法能够动态积累判别性历史知识，有效解决CTTA中的知识遗忘和干扰问题

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了少样本医学图像分割性能，达到了新的state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: DPL通过扩散概率建模有效解决了医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战，为少样本学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSP（State Space Prompting）的新方法，通过结合帧内和帧间提示来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频分类性能并减少了微调参数开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但序列压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播和判别性信息的提取。

Method: 设计了Intra-Frame Gathering（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及Inter-Frame Spreading（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息。通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息，SSP以互补方式有效传播视频中的判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法显著提升了2.76%的性能，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的时空信息，在视频理解任务中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能，证明了其在视频分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Motivation: 全监督3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。盒级标注虽然更可扩展，但存在重叠区域模糊性问题。现有两阶段方法训练复杂且无法端到端优化。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器并通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询优化来提升定位精度，设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪标签。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效且有效的盒监督3D实例分割解决方案，通过端到端训练和创新的损失设计，在减少标注负担的同时保持了高质量的分割性能。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CompoDistill是一种通用的知识蒸馏框架，能有效提升学生模型的视觉感知能力，具有很好的泛化性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DIANet的双流框架，通过分别处理微表情的起始到峰值阶段和峰值到结束阶段，并利用交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征，在微表情识别任务上取得了优于传统单阶段方法的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 微表情识别具有重要应用价值，但由于微表情的短暂性和数据稀缺性而面临挑战。传统的动态图像方法往往忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的时间建模方法。

Method: 提出DIANet双流框架：1）分别生成起始到峰值和峰值到结束阶段的相位感知动态图像；2）每个流使用专用卷积神经网络处理；3）采用交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合两个流的特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法 consistently优于传统的单阶段动态图像方法，验证了显式建模时间相位信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了显式建模时间相位信息的重要性，为微表情识别研究提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高性能VL推理训练数据集的原则仍不明确，需要系统研究数据筛选策略对模型能力的影响。

Method: 通过控制训练和评估设置，分析上下文来源的影响，实施数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链的规模化扩展。

Result: 研究发现上下文来源策略显著影响VLM性能，数据干预带来显著提升，数据维度扩展持续改善推理能力。HoneyBee数据集训练的模型在多个基准测试中超越SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进的VL推理数据集筛选策略，HoneyBee数据集和测试时缩放策略有效提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本，为VL推理研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像和视频生成中，并行预测多个标记虽然能提高推理效率，但容易产生结构不一致问题，且传统方法缺乏回溯修正机制。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机标记来提高鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现标记修正。

Result: 在ImageNet-256、CIFAR-10图像生成和UCF-101、NuScenes视频生成任务上均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行标记预测效率优势的同时，显著提升了生成质量，适用于多种生成模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中存在的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中面临分布偏差限制

Method: 两阶段方法：1）小波引导跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2）真实域噪声不变性学习构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，在跨域场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测的跨域和噪声挑战，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集验证方法有效性

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动先验，容易因跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动而崩溃

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少的参数实现高视频重建精度，支持复杂视频处理任务如视频修复和关键帧编辑

Conclusion: 代理节点表示方法能够有效处理视频中的长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，支持可控的细粒度外观编辑

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，相比传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合，在数据稀缺情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高而数据稀缺，传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合对超参数敏感且性能欠佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上引入置信度驱动的指数缩放，强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优后的加法损失和现有损失函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为在数据稀缺挑战下实现鲁棒分割提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调节的机制。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要辅助OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制

Method: 利用ID图像背景特征作为伪OOD特征进行训练，基于卷积的局部不变性提取背景特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准上验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有良好的组合兼容性，达到了新的最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，通过利用ID图像背景特征有效缓解了OOD检测中的过度自信问题

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于角度感知的可见光-红外图像融合框架AngularFuse，通过跨模态互补掩码模块、精细参考图像合成策略和角度感知损失函数，解决了现有方法在细节保留和亮度平衡方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督融合方法主要依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节缺失、亮度不均匀，以及梯度损失仅关注梯度幅度而忽略方向的问题。

Method: 1. 设计跨模态互补掩码模块强制学习模态间互补信息；2. 结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化生成细节更丰富、亮度更平衡的参考图像；3. 提出角度感知损失函数，首次在梯度域同时约束梯度幅度和方向。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD公开数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，视觉对比证实该方法在挑战性场景中能产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过创新的角度感知框架，有效提升了可见光-红外图像融合的质量，在纹理强度和边缘方向保持方面表现出色，具有优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

TL;DR: PAGS是一个用于动态3D城市场景重建的框架，通过引入任务感知的语义优先级，在保持关键对象细节的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态3D重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，原因是它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同资源。

Method: 1. 语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略：使用混合重要性度量简化非关键场景元素，保留导航关键对象的细节
2. 优先级驱动渲染管线：基于优先级的深度预传递来剔除被遮挡基元，加速最终着色计算

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间，渲染速度超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过将语义优先级直接注入3D重建和渲染流程，成功解决了动态城市场景重建中效率与质量之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法假设视频已预剪辑且只包含文本相关内容，但实际视频通常未经剪辑、时长较长且包含复杂背景内容，因此需要解决部分相关视频检索这一更实用且具挑战性的任务。

Method: 提出双学习框架与动态知识蒸馏方法，包含大型教师模型和紧凑的双分支学生网络。继承分支吸收教师模型的可迁移知识，探索分支学习PRVR数据集的特定任务信息以解决领域差距，并采用动态软目标构建机制替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在部分相关视频检索任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DL-DKD++框架通过知识蒸馏和双分支学习策略，有效解决了未剪辑视频中部分相关内容的检索问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但在幻觉问题上仍然脆弱，特别是标志幻觉问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和文本标志的精心划分数据集，通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，对LLaVA进行嵌入级分析并实施针对性消融。

Result: 幻觉在强烈扭曲下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最大弱点；幻觉与投影器维度的子集相关，针对性消融可显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。

Conclusion: VLMs往往依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知，投影器子空间在此失败模式中起决定性作用，投影器解缠和OCR引导解码是构建可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个语义场景补全框架，通过光流时序对齐和课程学习深度融合，解决了现有方法在运动推理和深度监督方面的不足，在SemanticKITTI基准上达到16.9 mIoU的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单目图像的语义场景补全方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 提出CurriFlow框架：1）使用预训练光流进行多级特征对齐；2）课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度；3）利用SAM提供类别无关的语义先验监督。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9 mIoU，验证了运动引导和课程感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过运动引导的时序对齐和课程学习的深度融合策略，显著提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制来减少深度神经网络的计算复杂度，特别适用于3D医学影像和视频分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随着计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法虽然解决了不可微采样问题，但缺乏输入自适应性。

Method: 提出了注意力引导的采样模块，该模块在推理过程中也能适应不同输入，实现了动态自适应采样。该方法可以集成到任何神经网络架构中，解决了传统方法只能任务适应而不能输入适应的问题。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括一个具有挑战性的真实临床条件收集的内部数据集）上的分类任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了性能提升和复杂度降低。

Conclusion: 所提出的输入自适应采样框架能够有效减少深度神经网络的计算负担，同时保持或提升模型性能，特别适用于计算资源受限的医学影像分析应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: STORM-PSR是一个用于程序步骤识别的双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来解决现有方法在物体部分遮挡时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的程序步骤识别模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的组装物体状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 提出STORM-PSR双流框架：组装状态检测流处理无遮挡物体视图，时空流包含空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器，通过弱监督预训练捕获空间特征并学习时间关系。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比现有方法分别将组装步骤完成预测的平均延迟降低了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过时空流显著降低了预测延迟，该流不依赖无遮挡物体视图即可推断完成步骤，证明了时空特征在程序步骤识别中的重要性。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

TL;DR: 提出概率化重解释的SCR模型训练方法，通过引入高层次重建先验来改善单场景训练中的退化问题，特别是在多视角约束不足的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCR模型针对单场景训练，当训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时模型会退化。需要引入先验知识来提升重建质量。

Method: 提出概率化SCR训练框架，集成多种先验：从简单的深度分布先验到基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型，在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向合理几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上验证，该方法能学习到更好的场景表示，产生更一致的点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 概率化先验注入能有效提升SCR模型的性能，特别是在多视角约束不足的情况下，为3D视觉任务提供更鲁棒的场景表示。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Method: 采用PRISMA方法，分析了2021-2025年间发表的32篇同行评审研究，重点研究四个核心问题：VLM处理的城市监测任务、常用架构和框架、支持数据集和资源、评估方法和性能水平。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型有望解决传统城市监测方法的局限性，通过机器视觉实现更高效、可扩展的城市基础设施监测。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI具有便携和经济优势，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要解决质量差距而无需昂贵基础设施

Method: 使用条件流匹配学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，通过直接回归最优速度场，避免迭代采样或对抗目标

Result: 在低场MRI重建任务中达到最先进性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有强泛化能力，且参数数量显著少于竞争方法

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，特别适合资源有限的临床环境

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的框架，用于解决长视频理解中时序上下文缺失和关键信息丢失的问题。该框架采用分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1）难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2）稀疏帧采样可能导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 提出VideoLucy框架，受人类从粗到细的回忆过程启发，采用分层记忆结构（具有渐进粒度），通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中，VideoLucy显著优于现有最先进方法，性能甚至超过GPT-4o等专有模型。同时提出了新的评估基准EgoMem。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯机制有效解决了长视频理解的时序理解和细节保留问题，为长视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测器面临黑盒攻击的挑战，需要开发能够同时保证对抗样本可迁移性和视觉不可察觉性的攻击方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块（MNTD-PGD和SG-PGD）生成对抗候选样本；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块基于成功率和结构相似性筛选最优样本。

Result: MS-GAGA在未见检测器上实现了比现有最先进攻击方法高27%的错误分类率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合优化可迁移性和不可察觉性，有效提升了黑盒攻击深度伪造检测器的性能。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够有效解决运动模糊图像下的3D场景重建问题，通过双阶段优化和梯度聚合策略实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习UDFs时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性差的问题，需要一种更稳定高效的解决方案。

Method: 首先基于Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，通过能量函数优化对齐；然后将对齐的法向量扩散形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到最终UDF。

Result: 实验表明VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算高效和稳定。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算稳定、高效的UDF计算方法，适用于各种复杂拓扑结构。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶模型仅使用模仿学习存在泛化能力差的问题，而强化学习虽然能促进探索但面临样本效率低和收敛不稳定的挑战。结合两种方法的优势，超越传统的两阶段范式（IL预训练+RL微调）。

Method: 提出CoIRL-AD竞争双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练过程中进行互动。引入基于竞争的机制，促进知识交换同时防止梯度冲突。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD通过竞争机制有效结合了IL和RL的优势，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能和泛化能力，特别是在复杂场景下的表现。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates

### [56] [MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565)
*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含大规模数据集和新型多光谱导向感知跟踪方案，显著提升小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下因空间外观线索退化而可靠性不足，多光谱图像能提供更好的目标区分能力，但缺乏专门的多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出多光谱和方向感知的MOT方案：1）轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem集成光谱特征；2）方向感知卡尔曼滤波器；3）端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 实验表明多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升跟踪性能，特别是在小目标和密集物体场景下。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的方法将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

*Quang Nguyen,Tri Le,Baoru Huang,Minh Nhat Vu,Ngan Le,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的时间条件模型，用于生成与输入信号时间对齐的人类运动，解决了现有方法在时间对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉注意力机制的方法主要捕捉全局交互，难以保持逐步的时间对齐，导致生成的运动与条件信号的时间模式不一致。

Method: 引入Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息集成到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的TCM模型通过改进的时间条件机制，有效解决了人类运动生成中的时间对齐问题，为基于时间依赖输入信号的运动生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet植物分类模型、DinoV2主干网络和Segment Anything Model (SAM)，无需收集新数据集即可实现植物区域分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中标注数据稀缺的问题，利用现有植物专用模型来避免大规模数据标注的瓶颈。

Method: 使用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细分割。比较了基于Plantnet微调的DinoV2和基础DinoV2模型的性能。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础模型在Jaccard指数(IoU)上获得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效的分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过利用扩散模型自身中间层表示的正则化来提高生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与中间层表示相关，外部指导可以加速训练，但需要外部监督。作者希望开发一种自监督的方法来利用模型内部表示进行正则化。

Method: 基于扩散模型不同层表示质量差异的观察，LayerSync使用语义最丰富的表示作为内在指导来正则化较弱的表示层。这是一种即插即用的正则化项，不增加训练开销。

Result: 在图像生成任务上显著提升训练效率（在ImageNet数据集上加速8.75倍）和生成质量（提升23.6%），并成功应用于音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种通用、自监督的正则化方法，能够有效提高扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，适用于多种模态，且无需外部资源。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，用于提升像素空间扩散模型和一致性模型的性能，通过在ImageNet数据集上实现SOTA结果，显著缩小了像素空间模型与潜在空间模型之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的效率和性能差距。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器结合，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上达到FID 2.04（75 NFE），ImageNet-512上达到FID 2.35，一致性模型在单步采样中达到FID 8.82，大幅超越先前像素空间方法。

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功实现了不依赖预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型训练，证明了像素空间模型可以达到与潜在空间模型相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态潜在推理方法IVT-LR，通过在潜在空间中结合视觉和文本信息进行推理，解决了现有方法依赖显式推理步骤导致的高标注成本和推理延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法需要显式的推理步骤，这需要大量的人工视觉-文本标注，并且会引入显著的推理延迟。为了解决这些问题，需要开发一种更高效的多模态推理方法。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中表示每个推理步骤，结合潜在文本（来自前一步的隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（一组选定的图像嵌入）。采用渐进式多阶段训练策略来训练MLLMs执行多模态潜在推理。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上的实验表明，IVT-LR方法在准确率上平均提升5.45%，同时推理速度比现有方法快5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法通过潜在空间推理有效解决了多模态推理中的标注成本和推理效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Method: 基于整流流的WaterFlow框架，创新性地将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow实现了S_m指标0.072的提升，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用水下物理成像先验和时间建模，显著提升了水下显著目标检测的性能，为领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨频一致性的零样本去噪方法ZSCFC，能够在单张噪声图像上进行训练和去噪，不依赖噪声分布假设，在计算效率和去噪性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实复杂噪声场景下的应用效果。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带具有位置相似性和内容一致性的特性，而噪声不具备此特性，设计了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能上优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法有效解决了现有零样本去噪方法的局限性，为真实世界复杂噪声场景提供了高效的去噪解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的HMR方法依赖于大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。希望开发更简单高效的模型，特别是在不同计算预算下建立基线。

Method: 构建三个轻量级HMR2.0变体，并利用分层视觉基础模型（如Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer、VMamba）的早期阶段作为编码器，仅使用前两或三个阶段。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层VFM的HMR和HPE模型，发现仅使用前两或三个阶段就能达到与完整模型相当的性能，且在精度和计算效率之间表现出更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段可以有效地用于人体网格恢复和姿态估计任务，提供比现有轻量级替代方案更优的性能效率平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机集群协作感知提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过占用预测方法克服了传统边界框表示的局限性，在保持高精度的同时大幅优化了通信效率。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在处理带有噪声标签的开放集域泛化时，难以有效弥合域间差距，特别是在有限清洁标签数据的情况下。噪声标签会破坏源域知识，使得模型更难识别已知类别和拒绝未知类别。

Method: 提出EReLiFM方法，包括两个核心机制：1）无监督的两阶段证据损失聚类方法，以提升标签可靠性感知；2）残差流匹配机制，建模结构化的域和类别条件残差，实现超越基于插值增强的多样化和不确定性感知的迁移路径。在元学习过程中，模型优化使得在清洁集上的更新方向能够最大化在噪声集上的损失减少。

Result: 实验结果表明，EReLiFM在OSDG-NL任务上优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过结合证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配机制，有效解决了带有噪声标签的开放集域泛化问题，为实际应用中的模型泛化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Conclusion: H-EGL框架有效提升了医学影像中Transformer模型的注意力对齐和泛化性能，无需依赖昂贵的人工监督，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Method: 引入IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个挑战性开放任务（603单轮，601多轮），涵盖五个领域，配备详细评分标准进行系统评估。

Result: 当前MLLMs在视觉与工具集成方面表现困难，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率，不同模型表现出差异化的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS为推进MLLMs视觉智能提供了关键见解，揭示了从被动视觉感知到可操作认知工作空间的转变需求。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个个性化的联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器分离通用和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端能够充分利用自身和其他客户端的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗领域应用需要针对特定任务进行微调，但受限于数据隐私保护，难以聚合多源数据。联邦学习可以解决数据共享问题，但需要更有效的个性化微调方法。

Method: 提出个性化联邦微调方法，使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端既能利用自身数据又能从其他客户端数据中受益。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果表明，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域基础模型的联邦微调提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案，能够在保护数据隐私的同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

*Junhao Zhuang,Shi Guo,Xin Cai,Xiaohui Li,Yihao Liu,Chun Yuan,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的单步流式视频超分框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微小条件解码器实现实时性能，在A100 GPU上达到约17FPS处理768x1408视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在真实世界视频超分中的高延迟、高计算成本和超高分辩率泛化能力差的问题，使基于扩散的VSR变得实用化。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分，使用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算，采用微小条件解码器加速重建，并构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的VSR-120K数据集。

Result: FlashVSR可可靠扩展到超高分辩率，在保持SOTA性能的同时比先前单步扩散VSR模型快12倍，在A100上处理768x1408视频达17FPS。

Conclusion: FlashVSR实现了高效、可扩展和实时的视频超分，为基于扩散的VSR研究提供了实用解决方案，将发布代码、预训练模型和数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS框架通过整合视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，解决了现有方法在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、数据稀疏性和视角限制方面的问题，在多个任务上超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的场景感知、理解和仿真方法存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要一种更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，将VPS、VO和SR任务集成到统一的迭代视角中：1）VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；2）VO结合全景分割结果和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；3）SR利用VO结果将稀疏点云转换为神经场以合成高质量视图。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，基于注意力的特征融合方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于大多数现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成多个任务，实现了对场景的全面理解，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个关键任务上取得了优异性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench是一个针对文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体协作生成多样化问题，评估多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉艺术分析中的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准主要评估简单句法结构和表面属性，无法测试模型对复杂视觉艺术领域的深度语义理解，导致模型倾向于利用统计捷径而非真正进行视觉推理。

Method: 采用新颖的多智能体流水线，让专业智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细粒度问题，构建基于相关视觉理解维度的基准。

Result: 对14个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，发现当前模型存在显著局限性，包括简单计数任务的意外弱点，以及专有模型和开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench揭示了现有模型在复杂视觉艺术理解方面的不足，为开发更强大的多模态模型提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为E-MoFlow的无监督框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中这两个问题独立处理时的病态挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机中缺乏鲁棒的数据关联使得在没有真实标签监督的情况下独立解决光流和6-DoF自运动估计成为病态问题。现有方法要么引入偏差和计算开销，要么容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；引入微分几何约束融入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 实验表明该方法在通用6-DoF运动场景中具有良好适应性，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机视觉中的关键挑战。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过跨注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件追踪即可实现高质量运动校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动是脑PET成像中的主要挑战，会导致图像伪影和示踪剂定量不准确。硬件运动追踪在临床实践中应用受限，需要开发数据驱动的替代方案。

Method: DL-HMC++采用监督学习方式，利用带有金标准运动测量的动态PET扫描数据进行训练。该方法基于跨注意力机制，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动参数。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准HMT难以区分。标准摄取值分析显示平均差异比HRRT为1.2±0.5%，mCT为0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除HMT负担，使运动校正技术能够广泛应用于临床环境。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练的问题，这些方法在推理时无法泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需针对特定特征提取器进行训练。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，同时保持特征语义并保持高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法易于应用于广泛的下游任务，解决了特征上采样中的泛化问题。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Motivation: 传统的动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了它们在视图和时间上的观测质量差异，导致在遮挡情况下出现运动漂移和极端视角合成质量下降。

Method: 提出不确定性感知优化方法，估计每个高斯点的时间变化不确定性，构建时空图来传播可靠的运动线索，通过不确定性权重指导高斯点的优化过程。

Result: 在多种真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，该方法能显著提升动态高斯泼溅模型的性能，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，并在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 明确建模不确定性能够持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，验证了不确定性感知在4D重建中的重要性，为处理遮挡和极端视角提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的范式，使统一多模态模型的理解模块能够通过自奖励机制引导和增强其生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人化身的过程昂贵且耗时，需要大型相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家的大量手动工作。虽然现有方法可以从单张图像自动生成动画化身，但缺乏多视角信息或显式3D表示的约束，导致视角偏离参考图像时质量下降。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一的多模态编码器，通过Layerwise Attention Pooling机制提取文本和视觉特征，实现跨模态知识转移和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了扩散模型进行跨模态推理和知识转移的能力。之前的方法需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制从冻结VLM中提取高低层特征；开发VERIFI方法，在模型内提示重写时仅使用VLM生成的文本标记来调节扩散变换器。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；在编辑任务上微调不仅提高了生成质量，还展现出强大的泛化能力，单图像编辑训练后能零样本泛化到多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识转移的有效性，为多模态生成提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO是一种新的训练算法，通过基于图像语义复杂度动态调整视觉令牌数量来降低多模态大语言模型的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型由于图像输入引入的额外视觉令牌导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多个具有不同图像压缩比的MLP连接器，根据图像语义复杂度对视觉令牌进行下采样，通过最小化不同MLP连接器间响应的KL散度进行训练，并在推理时使用视觉分辨率路由器自动选择压缩率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能将视觉令牌数量减少高达50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: ViCO方法为开发更高效的多模态大语言模型做出了贡献，有望推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方体多参数持久性（CMP）集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持久性组合，提升图像分类和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方体复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，双过滤函数联合学习。

Result: 在医学影像和计算机视觉基准数据集上，CuMPerLay在分类和分割任务中表现优异，特别是在数据有限场景下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0提出了一种通过世界建模预测未来图像来增强视觉-语言-动作模型训练的方法，解决了VLA模型的监督不足问题，显著提升了驾驶智能性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型存在"监督不足"问题：模型的大容量仅被稀疏的低维动作监督，导致表示能力未被充分利用。

Method: 采用世界建模来预测未来图像，生成密集的自监督信号；为两种主要VLA架构分别设计自回归世界模型（离散视觉标记）和扩散世界模型（连续视觉特征）；引入轻量级动作专家模块解决实时推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线方法，并放大了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大性能增益加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模为VLA模型提供了有效的密集监督信号，能够更好地学习驾驶环境动态，是实现通用驾驶智能的有前景路径。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的多模态大语言模型，通过特殊任务设计、数据引擎和两阶段训练流程，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当的目标检测性能，并具备多种视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型主要基于坐标回归，而现有MLLM方法存在召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题。本文旨在弥合这一差距，开发更通用、语言感知的视觉感知系统。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示量化坐标(0-999)；2) 构建多数据引擎生成高质量标注数据；3) 采用两阶段训练：22M数据的监督微调+基于GRPO的强化学习后训练，使用几何感知奖励来改善坐标预测精度。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型(DINO、Grounding DINO)的性能，并具备对象引用、指向、视觉提示、GUI定位、空间引用、OCR和关键点检测等能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用、语言感知的视觉感知系统开辟了新途径，通过创新的任务制定、数据生成和训练策略，成功将MLLM应用于目标检测任务。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够进行按需多轮网页搜索的多模态大语言模型，通过动态生成图像和文本搜索查询来解决现有方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RAG、搜索代理等）存在管道僵化、搜索调用过多和查询构建不良等问题，导致效率低下和结果不佳。需要开发能够动态适应现实世界信息变化的多模态搜索系统。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含通过自动化管道与真实网页信息混合的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪个搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网页搜索，并迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网页搜索提供了有价值的见解，展示了动态查询生成和迭代搜索策略的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

<details>

Motivation: 虽然基于地标语义配准的方法相比纯几何方法在全局定位方面表现出性能提升，但地标可能重复且容易误导对应关系建立

Method: 使用高斯过程学习语义分布的连续函数，构建包含对象层、连续函数层和度量语义层的三层3D场景图，作为轻量级但高性能的单次定位后端

Result: 在公开数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了该方法相对于当前最先进方法的优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的Outram-GSF（高斯语义场）全局定位管道通过连续语义函数捕获更细粒度的地理语义信息，提供了更详细的度量信息用于对应关系建立

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有机器人策略在处理高频任务和资源受限系统时存在效率问题，需要一种能够同时实现高速和高精度操作的新框架

Method: 基于两个核心组件：1) 采用能量评分作为学习目标以促进多模态动作建模；2) 引入能量MLP实现该目标并保持架构简洁高效

Result: 在模拟环境和真实机器人任务中的实验表明，Energy Policy在性能上匹配或超越最先进方法，同时显著降低计算开销。在MimicGen基准测试中，以更快推理速度实现更优性能

Conclusion: Energy Policy是一个高效的多模态机器人操作策略框架，能够在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算需求，适用于高频和资源受限的机器人应用场景

Abstract: We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation,
named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and
resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy
natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core
components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to
facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to
implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and
efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments
and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy.
The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy
achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: MAPS是一种计算工具，通过将神经网络归因图转换为解释掩蔽图像，比较人类在有限像素预算下的识别准确率，评估不同ANN可解释性方法的行为有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类核心物体识别依赖于视觉信息的选择性使用，但难以直接测量这些选择策略。需要一种工具来测试神经网络解释是否能解释人类视觉。

Method: MAPS将归因图转换为解释掩蔽图像(EMIs)，在有限像素预算下比较人类在最小图像和完整刺激上的识别准确率差异。

Result: MAPS能可靠恢复模型归因图的地面真实相似性，识别出与生物视觉最一致的ANN解释组合，达到气泡掩模的行为有效性但需要更少行为试验。

Conclusion: MAPS提供了一种可扩展工具，在避免详尽心理物理学的同时，基于共同标准裁决解释并连接人类行为、神经活动和模型决策。

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual
information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure
directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a
behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations
derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision.
MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and
compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited
pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled
way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In
silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the
ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing
which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to
humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose
explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the
behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral
trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of
behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics
while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human
behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Motivation: 多维数据中的缺失条目对下游分析构成挑战，现有方法依赖经验收敛或不切实际的假设（如深度去噪器作为隐式正则化器的近端算子），需要更理论严谨的解决方案。

Method: 基于Davis-Yin分裂方案，开发了GTCTV DPC算法，将广义低秩先验与深度伪收缩去噪器结合，扩展了传统凸优化框架。

Result: 大量实验表明，GTCTV DPC在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，特别是在低采样率下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为张量补全提供了理论保证的解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性，在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

TL;DR: SeeingSounds是一个轻量级模块化框架，通过音频-语言-视觉的三模态交互实现音频到图像生成，无需配对音频-视觉数据或视觉生成模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，反映人类感知中自然存在的跨模态关联，避免将音频简单替代文本或仅依赖音频-文本映射。

Method: 采用双重对齐策略：音频通过冻结语言编码器投影到语义语言空间，同时使用视觉语言模型将音频上下文接地到视觉域。模型在冻结扩散骨架上运行，仅训练轻量级适配器。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SeeingSounds在零样本和监督设置下均优于现有方法，建立了可控音频到视觉生成的新技术水平。

Conclusion: 该框架支持通过程序化文本提示生成实现细粒度和可解释的控制，音频变换（如音量或音高变化）可转化为描述性提示来指导视觉输出。

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for
audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language,
and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual
generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or
relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment:
audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language
encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a
vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience,
reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The
model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight
adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports
fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt
generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts)
translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide
visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that
SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised
settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVN方法在面对未听过的声音或未见过的环境时表现不佳，导航成功率急剧下降，搜索路径过长。这源于缺乏听觉信号与对应视觉区域之间的显式对齐机制，导致策略在训练中记忆虚假的"声学指纹-场景"相关性。

Method: 提出AGVP框架：1）通过音频自注意力提取全局听觉上下文；2）使用该上下文作为查询引导视觉特征注意力，在特征层面突出声源相关区域；3）进行时序建模和策略优化。该设计基于可解释的跨模态对齐和区域重加权。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGVP提高了导航效率和鲁棒性，在面对未听过的声音时实现了优越的跨场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGVP框架通过显式的跨模态对齐机制，减少了对特定声学指纹的依赖，有效解决了音频-视觉具身导航中的跨源泛化问题。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously
navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While
current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor
cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths
become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen
environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment
mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies
tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations
during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound
sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound
from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The
framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then
uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting
sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling
and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on
interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency
on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP
improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior
cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

Conclusion: SAIL-Embedding通过创新的训练策略成功解决了多模态表示学习的实际挑战，在真实工业场景中表现出卓越的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

*Stella Frank,Emily Allaway*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs在典型和异常图像上的概念理解表现存在差异，当图像与文本不匹配时，基于一致性的实用先验会导致概念理解下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在处理典型和异常实例时如何平衡实用先验（输入一致性）和语义先验（概念一般性）之间的权衡。

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析VLMs的表现。

Result: 当图像与文本不匹配时，概念理解显著下降，这种基于一致性的实用先验效应强于语义先验。

Conclusion: VLMs在处理异常实例时更依赖输入一致性，这限制了其在非典型情况下的概念理解能力。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni-Detective数据生成管道和Omni-Cloze评估基准，用于解决多模态语言模型在细粒度感知中的细节与幻觉平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在捕捉和描述细粒度细节方面存在限制，且细节与幻觉之间存在固有的"共同增长"关系，需要系统性的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Omni-Detective代理数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高质量多模态数据；训练了Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner两个模型；设计了Omni-Cloze填空式评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上超越所有开源模型，性能媲美Gemini 2.5 Pro；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现最佳细节-幻觉平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量详细描述，Omni-Cloze为细粒度多模态感知提供了稳定可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

### [99] [MosaicDiff: Training-free Structural Pruning for Diffusion Model Acceleration Reflecting Pretraining Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11962)
*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff是一个新的扩散模型加速框架，通过轨迹感知的结构剪枝将扩散预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐。该方法根据预训练不同阶段的学习速度差异进行自适应剪枝，在保持输出质量的同时显著提升采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一特性。本研究旨在利用预训练动态来优化采样加速过程。

Method: 提出轨迹感知结构剪枝方法，根据扩散预训练的三个阶段（早期慢学习、中期快学习、后期慢学习）采用不同的剪枝策略：中期阶段保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的实验表明，该方法在不影响输出质量的情况下实现了显著的采样加速，大幅超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MosaicDiff为无训练扩散加速提供了新的视角，证明了将预训练动态与采样加速过程对齐的有效性，为更高效和鲁棒的扩散模型加速开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: VAR基生成式分类器为研究生成式分类器提供了新视角，在保持高性能的同时显著改善了计算效率和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

### [101] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力之间的关系，提出尖锐性应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化差的可靠指标，并通过实证研究表明正则化会形成更尖锐的最小值，但这些最小值反而能带来更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与深度神经网络的更好泛化相关，但近期研究显示这种关系更加复杂，存在理论反例和实证例外。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，分析不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下最小值的尖锐性与模型性能的关系。

Result: 正则化会导致更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而与更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性相关；无正则化的基线倾向于收敛到更平坦的最小值但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦性单独决定解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DiffEM方法，通过期望最大化算法训练扩散模型，仅使用含噪声的观测数据进行学习，解决了在仅有损坏数据时训练扩散模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型已成为高维逆问题的强大生成先验，但当只有损坏或含噪声的观测数据可用时，学习这些模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: DiffEM方法利用条件扩散模型在E步中从观测数据重建干净数据，然后在M步中使用重建数据来优化条件扩散模型。该方法基于期望最大化算法框架。

Result: 理论分析表明在适当统计条件下，DiffEM迭代具有单调收敛保证。实验证明该方法在多种图像重建任务中有效。

Conclusion: DiffEM为仅使用损坏数据训练扩散模型提供了一种有效方法，具有理论收敛保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.
