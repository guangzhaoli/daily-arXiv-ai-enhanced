### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 训练一个基于自然语言描述的3D手部动作生成模型，利用大规模手语视频数据集和伪标注数据，通过LLM生成文本标签，并训练扩散模型HandMDM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是生成符合文本描述的3D手部动作，解决手语和非手语动作的多样性问题。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和伪标注数据，通过LLM生成文本标签，训练文本条件扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在未见过的同一手语类别、其他手语和非手语动作中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: HandMDM在多样场景中表现优异，支持未来研究，并将公开模型和数据。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR框架通过视频到事件的映射和高效的提示调优，实现了长期视频中细粒度动作识别的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型在长期视频动作识别中计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时间依赖和语义理解有限的问题。

Method: 提出VT-LVLM-AR框架，包括视频到事件映射器（VTEM）和基于LVLM的动作推理模块，采用提示调优（P-Tuning v2）进行适配。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D数据集上达到94.1%的准确率，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 展示了利用LVLM通过视频到语言的转换和高效模型适配实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一种新型框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用病理视觉语言基础模型的潜力，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但由于专家资源有限，诊断面临挑战。现有方法依赖视觉特征，忽略了跨模态知识，影响诊断的可解释性。

Method: PathPT通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转化为细粒度瓦片级指导，保留癌变区域的定位能力，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56种亚型，2910张WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上，PathPT在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了亚型分类准确性，尤其在专家资源有限的环境中。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以捕捉细粒度语义信息，限制了检测效果。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，并引入专用数据集ShipSem-VL。

Result: 通过三项任务评估框架性能，展示了其在语义感知船舶检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架从多角度推动了语义感知船舶检测的发展。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种无需深度学习的手动自由奶牛识别系统，包括自动分类器、奶牛识别器和奶牛查找器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中缺乏无需手动干预的奶牛自动识别系统。

Method: 系统由AutoCattloger、eidetic cow recognizer和CowFinder组成，用于构建奶牛目录和识别。

Result: 在未标记的视频中成功识别了自由活动的奶牛。

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛管理提供了一种高效且无需深度学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Motivation: 物种分布模型可以编码物种出现的空间模式，为视觉分类提供有效的地理先验信息。

Method: 评估了多种SINR模型作为地理先验的效果，研究了不同模型配置及对未训练物种预测的处理方式。

Result: 分析揭示了影响SINR模型作为地理先验效果的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图的考量不同。

Conclusion: SINR模型在视觉分类中作为地理先验具有潜力，但需注意模型配置和未训练物种的处理方式。

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容，克服了传统Vision Transformers固定大小分区的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和领域假设（如网格结构），限制了灵活性。

Method: 采用自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容，取代固定大小的分区。

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中表现优于广泛使用的替代方法。

Conclusion: ASC通过动态调整分区提升了模型性能，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Glo-VLMs的系统框架，用于在数据受限的情况下将视觉语言模型（VLMs）应用于细粒度肾小球分类任务，并在少量标注数据下取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于肾小球亚型间形态学差异细微且难以与临床术语对齐，传统的视觉语言模型在细粒度分类任务中表现有限，因此需要探索如何有效适应这些模型以支持临床研究。

Method: 通过结合病理图像和临床文本提示，进行联合图像-文本表示学习，并在少样本学习范式下评估不同VLM架构和适应策略。

Result: 在每类仅8个样本的情况下，微调后的VLMs达到了0.7416的准确率、0.9045的宏AUC和0.5277的F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在监督数据极少的情况下，基础模型也能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类任务，为临床研究提供了实用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

*Minh-Tan Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文总结了作者在标签高效学习领域的贡献，特别是在计算机视觉和遥感中的应用，重点是通过有限标注数据和大量未标注数据提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中标注数据有限的问题，并利用未标注数据提升模型性能，尤其是在遥感数据中处理多模态、空间分辨率变化和场景异质性等挑战。

Method: 提出了四种方法：1）基于异常感知表示的弱监督学习；2）多任务学习；3）自监督和监督对比学习；4）少样本学习。

Result: 通过多种实验验证了方法的有效性，覆盖了自然和遥感数据集。

Conclusion: 未来研究将集中在扩展和增强标签高效学习在实际应用中的效果。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

*Ousmane Youme,Jean Marie Dembélé,Eugene C. Ezin,Christophe Cambier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，以提高在复杂环境中监测海洋垃圾的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋垃圾监测是全球性问题，传统CNN模型在复杂环境中（如沙滩）因多种干扰因素（如沙色反射、脚印、阴影等）效果不佳。

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，仅需少量样本即可实现高精度。

Result: 新模型在复杂环境中表现更鲁棒，准确性更高。

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法在海洋垃圾监测中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

*Jerry Cao-Xue,Tien Comlekoglu,Keyi Xue,Guanliang Wang,Jiang Li,Gordon Laurie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用SynFundus-1M合成数据集训练深度学习模型，在视网膜疾病分类中表现出色，并能泛化到真实临床数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床数据集稀缺问题，探索合成数据在视网膜疾病分类中的潜力。

Method: 训练六种现代架构（如ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2等），并使用XGBoost构建元集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上AUC达0.9973，在真实临床数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 合成数据训练模型能有效分类多种病理并泛化到真实图像，推动眼科AI发展。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于生成多样化的手语表示，同时保持视觉质量和非手动特征（如情感）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，尤其是非手动特征（如面部表情）。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型（LDM）生成参考图像，并提出新的手语特征聚合模块，分别建模非手动特征（如面部）和手动特征（如手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上，该方法在视觉质量和感知指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成多样化的手语表示，同时保持高质量和非手动特征的完整性。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRespNeT是一个高分辨率数据集，用于地震后环境的高空实例分割，提升搜救效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速识别地震后的可进入点和结构障碍对搜救至关重要，现有数据集依赖卫星图像或粗粒度标注，无法满足需求。

Method: 开发DRespNeT数据集，包含高清航拍视频的详细多边形实例分割标注，涵盖28个关键类别。

Result: 优化的YOLOv8-DRN模型达到92.7% mAP50和27 FPS，满足实时操作需求。

Conclusion: DRespNeT和模型支持搜救团队和机器人系统，提升人机协作和应急响应效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Conclusion: 该系统为低成本、自动化的物体几何建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoVeRaP数据集和合作感知框架显著提升了多车FMCW雷达的3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FMCW雷达稀疏、噪声点云对3D物体检测的限制。

Method: 提出CoVeRaP数据集和合作感知框架，采用多分支PointNet编码器和自注意力机制融合空间、多普勒和强度信息。

Result: 中融合与强度编码将平均精度提升至9倍，优于单车基线。

Conclusion: CoVeRaP为多车雷达感知提供了可复现基准，证明了雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

Method: WE-PaDiM将2D离散小波变换应用于多层CNN特征图，选择特定频率子带并空间对齐，然后通过PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，WE-PaDiM实现了99.32%的图像级AUC和92.10%的像素级AUC，性能优于随机特征选择。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM提供了一种可解释且高效的特征选择方法，适用于工业检测，并在性能和效率上表现出色。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ERA的新型知识蒸馏方法，通过分解残差知识的多步逼近和教师权重整合策略，显著提升了轻量模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于教师模型与学生模型之间的学习能力差距，传统知识蒸馏方法难以充分传递知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，利用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，并引入教师权重整合(TWI)策略以减少能力差距。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务中AP提升1.40，并在多个计算机视觉任务中表现领先。

Conclusion: ERA通过分而治之的策略和教师权重重用，有效提升了知识蒸馏的效果，为轻量模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和SSM的点云目标检测模型因体素表示的串行处理限制空间扩散能力，影响检测精度。

Method: VDM结合稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，输出特征图降采样至原始分辨率的四分之一，以增强空间上下文和细粒度信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，VDM显著提升了检测精度，如Waymo上达到74.7 mAPH (L2)，nuScenes上72.9 NDS。

Conclusion: VDM是一种通用且高效的方法，可无缝集成到主流检测模型中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ELF展示了集成学习在病理基础模型中的强大能力，为AI辅助精准肿瘤学提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local

Conclusion: DAFR2通过特征对齐和互信息增加，实现了跨域的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Result: 实验结果表明，RAGSR在生成感知真实的视觉细节和保持上下文一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGSR通过区域注意力机制有效克服了传统单图像超分辨率技术的局限性，显著提升了多对象场景下的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Result: 在Pascal-5i和COCO-20i数据集上分别提升了13.2%和9.7%，且参数仅为现有最优模型的1/24。

Conclusion: TLG是首个在相同骨干架构下弱监督模型性能超过全监督模型的方案。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised

Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割（UVOS）在初始分割和对象运动时存在不确定性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出FTIO框架，包含对象选择准则和三阶段时间一致性校正方法。

Result: 实验表明FTIO在多对象UVOS中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FTIO有效解决了UVOS中的对象选择和时间一致性问题。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，SpecVLM实现了最高2.68倍的解码加速。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过高效令牌剪枝，显著提升了视频大语言模型的解码速度，且不损失准确性。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

### [31] [Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16211)
*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa提出了一种基于ODE视角的特征缓存方法，显著提升了DiTs在高加速比下的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，主要由于长步预测的不稳定性。

Method: 将特征序列建模为特征-ODE，提出Forecast-then-Calibrate策略，解决历史特征整合问题。

Result: 在多个任务中实现高效加速（最高6.45倍），且保持高质量生成。

Conclusion: FoCa为DiTs提供了一种高效且稳定的特征缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，显著降低了扩散模型的采样计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但计算成本高，难以实时部署。本文旨在解决扩散Transformer的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出OmniCache方法，从采样角度分析模型的采样轨迹，全局分布缓存重用，并动态估计和过滤噪声以减少其对采样方向的影响。

Result: 实验表明，OmniCache在保持生成质量的同时加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为扩散模型的实时部署提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个新的基准和工作流程，用于评估医疗大语言模型（LLMs）在推理可靠性和安全性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，评估其推理的可靠性（如Chain-of-Thought忠实性和反阿谀性）变得至关重要。现有基准常将这些漏洞简化为单一准确度分数。

Method: MedOmni-45 Degrees包含1,804个医疗问题，覆盖六个专业和三种任务类型，每个问题配有七种操纵性提示和无提示基线。评估了七种LLMs，结合准确性、CoT忠实性和反阿谀性三个指标。

Result: 结果显示所有模型均存在安全性与性能的权衡，开源模型QwQ-32B表现最佳（43.81 Degrees），但未在两方面均领先。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees为暴露医疗LLMs的推理漏洞和指导更安全的模型开发提供了针对性基准。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

TL;DR: PromptFlare是一种新型对抗保护方法，通过利用跨注意力机制和提示嵌入的内在特性，防止扩散模型对图像进行恶意修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，但也引发了恶意滥用的担忧。现有方法依赖图像级不一致性，难以解决文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，针对提示嵌入中的共享令牌注入对抗噪声，干扰采样过程，从而中和提示的效果。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上表现出色，显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种高效且鲁棒的对抗保护方法，可有效防止未经授权的图像操作。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMCW是一个新的抽象挑战，现有方法迁移成本高且语义不一致，需经济高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: FlexMUSE包含T2I模块、msaGate、跨模态注意力融合和mscDPO，支持可选视觉输入并增强语义对齐。

Result: FlexMUSE在ArtMUSE数据集上表现优异，展示了其一致性、创造力和连贯性。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE为MMCW提供了高效灵活的解决方案，显著提升了多模态语义对齐和创意表现。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Motivation: MLLMs在GUI元素坐标生成中因语义空白和训练数据不足而表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 引入IoU增强的最大似然（IAML）训练范式，通过基于IoU的坐标采样增强数据，并优化训练过程。

Result: 实验表明IAML训练范式优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效提升了MLLMs在GUI元素坐标生成中的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了花样滑冰评分中的关键挑战，并展示了处理长视频的能力。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: 通过分析注意力头的信息冗余，提出熵注意力图（EAM）模型，冻结低熵注意力头并量化其值，以加速Transformer模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Head Self-Attention（MHSA）的计算复杂性和高内存需求限制了其在边缘设备上的部署，因此需要减少冗余计算。

Method: 通过香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，冻结低熵注意力头的权重并量化其值。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上验证，EAM在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时保持或提高准确性，对DeiT和Swin Transformer模型表现优异。

Conclusion: EAM通过减少冗余计算，有效加速Transformer模型推理，同时保持或提高模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Conclusion: 论文认为动态任务驱动的视觉编码器是未来方向，分类任务验证了其可行性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了随机时间扭曲（RTW）的基本功能可视为一种自注意力机制，类似于Transformer中的核心技术，用于运动识别。RTW与动态时间扭曲（DTW）相关，但通过贡献权重生成判别性特征，其权重与自注意力权重相似。RTW在全局输入序列上操作，优于Transformer的局部视图，性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW与自注意力机制的相似性，并比较两者在运动识别任务中的表现差异。

Method: 将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，分析其贡献权重与自注意力权重的相关性，并比较两者在输入序列上的操作范围。

Result: RTW与自注意力权重高度相关（平均相关性0.80），且在全局操作上优于Transformer的局部视图，性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可视为一种全局自注意力机制，其性能优于Transformer的局部自注意力，为运动识别任务提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 钢铁制造中实时表面缺陷检测对产品质量和生产效率至关重要，但现有深度学习方法计算复杂且速度慢，难以在资源受限的工业环境中部署。

Method: 提出GMBINet，采用GMBI模块进行多尺度特征提取和交互，包括双向渐进特征交互器（BPFI）和无参数EWMS操作，以降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，GMBINet在GPU上达到1048 FPS，CPU上16.53 FPS，仅需0.19 M参数，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持高精度的同时实现了实时检测，适用于更广泛的工业视觉应用。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有多传感器融合方法在恶劣天气（如浓雾、大雪或污染）下表现不佳，无法应对低光照和极端天气条件。

Method: 采用深度注意力机制融合多模态传感器数据，并在BEV平面上进行优化，利用Transformer解码器根据距离和可见性加权模态。

Result: 在长距离和雾天场景中，对易受伤害行人的检测平均精度（AP）比现有最佳方法提高了17.2 AP。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在恶劣天气条件下的传感器融合可靠性，填补了理想条件与现实边缘案例之间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R extends MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse, uncalibrated images, improving human-centric scenarios with a feed-forward approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUSt3R and MASt3R struggle with human-centric scenarios due to their focus on static outdoor scenes.

Method: Uses DUNE, a distilled image encoder, and additional network heads for segmentation, DensePose, and depth prediction in human-centric environments.

Result: Produces dense point maps with human semantics, validated on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D benchmarks, and generalizes to traditional tasks.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R bridges the gap between human and scene understanding, offering efficient and effective 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Method: 构建了一个集成框架，包括尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数比例渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单模型下能高质量渲染任意比例高分辨率视图（PSNR提升6.59 dB），保持结构一致性并维持实时渲染速度（85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了灵活、高效且高质量的3D高斯溅射超分辨率。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection

applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart
factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring
systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PSSFL的半监督联邦学习方法，结合FedMox框架，解决了边缘设备计算资源有限和数据标注稀缺的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私敏感的应用中，基础模型（FMs）需要适应下游任务，但受限于数据隐私法规和边缘设备的资源限制。

Method: 提出PSSFL方法，边缘设备仅持有未标记的低分辨率数据，服务器持有少量标记的高分辨率数据；设计FedMox框架，通过稀疏的Mixture-of-Experts架构和Soft-Mixture策略解决计算和分辨率不匹配问题。

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的实验表明，FedMox在PSSFL下有效适应FMs，显著提升性能且内存成本可控。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦场景下可扩展且隐私保护的基础模型适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose是一个零样本、无模型的6D物体姿态估计和重建框架，利用预训练扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖CAD模型或需要额外训练的现有方法在成本和实用性上的限制。

Method: 通过多视角扩散模型和3D高斯泼溅表示，逐步融合新视角并优化姿态图。

Result: 在6D姿态估计和3D重建质量上显著优于现有方法，适用于实际机器人操作任务。

Conclusion: UnPose提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，无需CAD模型或额外训练。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 触觉传感在精确性和抗遮挡方面优于视觉方法，适用于高精度操作任务。

Method: 利用触觉衍生的表面法线和曲率进行鲁棒跟踪和闭环检测，实现实时低误差跟踪和高保真形状重建。

Result: 系统能实时跟踪物体运动，误差低且漂移小，形状重建精度达亚毫米级。

Conclusion: GelSLAM扩展了触觉传感的应用范围，为高精度操作任务提供了基础支持。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSQ在残差量化中存在信号衰减问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出RFSQ框架，结合可学习缩放因子和可逆层归一化。

Result: 在ImageNet上，RFSQ在感知损失和L1重建误差上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFSQ是一种更优的神经压缩量化方法。

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available
for reproducibility*.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Motivation: 缺血性卒中病灶的准确识别对诊断和治疗至关重要，但MRI在资源匮乏地区成本高昂，而CT图像的特异性较低。因此，研究旨在通过深度学习结合CT和DWI数据，提升低资源环境下的诊断质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合CT和DWI数据的深度学习模型及预处理步骤可显著提升缺血性卒中病灶分割性能，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LUT方法缺乏空间信息，而空间感知方法又因额外模块导致参数和运行时间增加。

Method: 通过分解3D LUT为低维LUT的线性组合，并应用SVD，同时优化空间特征融合模块以提高缓存效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了参数和运行时间，同时保持了空间感知和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于高分辨率图像增强。

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

Motivation: FDCT图像质量因伪影较低，但仅使用FDCT可优化患者管理，避免移动至MDCT室。

Method: 采用DDPM模型对FDCT图像去噪，提升质量。

Result: DDPM消除了大部分伪影，提升解剖结构可见性，且不影响出血检测。

Conclusion: DDPM能有效提升FDCT图像质量，适用于临床诊断。

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

TL;DR: RenalCLIP是一种基于视觉-语言基础模型的工具，用于肾肿瘤的非侵入性评估，在诊断和预后方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肾肿瘤诊断中的不确定性，减少对良性或惰性肿瘤的过度治疗。

Method: 采用两阶段预训练策略，先增强图像和文本编码器的领域知识，再通过对比学习对齐，生成鲁棒表示。

Result: 在10项核心任务中表现优于其他模型，特别是在复发自由生存预测任务中C-index达到0.726，数据效率高。

Conclusion: RenalCLIP可提高诊断准确性，优化预后分层，为肾癌患者提供个性化管理。

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

TL;DR: NeuroKoop是一种基于图神经网络的框架，通过神经Koopman算子驱动的潜在空间融合，整合结构和功能脑网络，以更好地理解产前药物暴露对青少年大脑组织的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究产前暴露于精神活性物质（如大麻）如何影响青少年大脑组织是一个关键挑战，现有方法难以充分捕捉结构和功能连接组中的互补特征。

Method: 提出NeuroKoop框架，利用Koopman理论统一来自源基形态测量（SBM）和功能网络连接（FNC）的节点嵌入，增强表示学习和分类性能。

Result: 在ABCD数据集的大规模青少年队列中，NeuroKoop优于相关基线方法，并揭示了显著的结构-功能连接。

Conclusion: NeuroKoop提高了对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解，并展示了其在多模态神经影像数据分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波空间特征分解的神经超分辨率方法，通过分离低频和高频细节提升纹理保留和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是改进神经超分辨率在图形渲染中的感知质量，尤其是保留细节和结构一致性。

Method: 方法采用静态小波变换（SWT）避免空间下采样，结合空间G缓冲和时间历史帧预测小波系数，再通过逆小波合成重建图像。

Result: 实验表明，SWT方法比基线DFASR在PSNR上提升1.5 dB，LPIPS降低17%，计算开销增加24 ms。

Conclusion: 结论是小波域表示是提升图形应用中神经超分辨率感知质量的有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的虚拟多重免疫染色技术，用于甲状腺癌中血管侵袭的评估，替代传统染色方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统免疫组化（IHC）和多重复色（mIHC）技术存在成本高、操作繁琐、组织切片变异等问题。

Method: 利用无标记组织切片的自发荧光显微镜图像，通过深度学习生成虚拟染色图像（ERG、PanCK和H&E）。

Result: 虚拟染色结果与传统染色高度一致，能准确识别上皮细胞和内皮细胞，并定位小血管侵袭。

Conclusion: 虚拟mIHC技术可显著提高诊断效率和准确性，减少组织损失和异质性，有望替代传统染色方法。

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

TL;DR: MoDER通过模块化框架增强预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，在增量微调中提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在持续学习中表现优异，但零样本能力在微调时可能受损，需进一步优化。

Method: 提出MoDER框架，训练多个文本专家并存储在中心库中，推理时组合专家生成优化原型。

Result: 在14个数据集的两种零样本增量协议（Class-IL和MTIL）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MoDER成功将零样本能力从保持提升为增强，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at
https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.
