### [1] [Multiple Object Tracking in Video SAR: A Benchmark and Tracking Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12105)
*Haoxiang Chen,Wei Zhao,Rufei Zhang,Nannan Li,Dongjin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视频合成孔径雷达（Video SAR）中多目标跟踪的方法，解决了多普勒偏移引起的伪影和目标外观变化问题，并发布了首个公开基准数据集VSMB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频SAR中目标运动导致的多普勒偏移会产生伪影，容易被误认为是静态遮挡的阴影，同时目标外观变化可能导致关联失败和轨迹中断。此外，该领域缺乏公开的基准数据集。

Method: 提出了一种线特征增强机制以减少运动目标的拖尾和散焦影响，并引入运动感知线索丢弃机制以应对目标外观变化。

Result: 在VSMB数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效提升了视频SAR中多目标跟踪的鲁棒性，并提供了标准化的评估基准。

Abstract: In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar
(Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that
are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover,
appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to
association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in
this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm
evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45
video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT
Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and
defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism
that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms
induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of
target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding
mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the
dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.

### [2] [BreastDCEDL: Curating a Comprehensive DCE-MRI Dataset and developing a Transformer Implementation for Breast Cancer Treatment Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12190)
*Naomi Fridman,Bubby Solway,Tomer Fridman,Itamar Barnea,Anat Goldshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BreastDCEDL是一个深度学习就绪的乳腺癌数据集，包含2070名患者的3D DCE-MRI扫描，用于开发先进的模型，如基于ViT的pCR预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌早期检测和治疗监测至关重要，但缺乏公开的多中心数据集限制了深度学习在DCE-MRI分析中的应用。

Method: 数据集标准化为3D NIfTI格式，提供统一注释和临床数据。开发了基于ViT的模型，融合三个对比阶段的图像进行pCR预测。

Result: ViT模型在HR+/HER2-患者中实现了AUC 0.94和准确率0.93的pCR预测性能。

Conclusion: BreastDCEDL填补了数据空白，支持可重复研究和临床建模。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,
including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial
training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed
the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast
phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT
model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-
patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark
splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically
meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

### [3] [ViSTA: Visual Storytelling using Multi-modal Adapters for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12198)
*Sibo Dong,Ismail Shaheen,Maggie Shen,Rupayan Mallick,Sarah Adel Bargal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSTA是一种多模态历史适配器，用于文本到图像扩散模型，通过提取相关历史特征和适配器生成一致且与叙述文本对齐的图像序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉故事生成中无法有效利用历史文本-图像对的问题，同时避免训练成本高或缺乏适应性的缺点。

Method: 提出多模态历史融合模块和历史适配器，结合显著历史选择策略，并使用TIFA指标评估文本-图像对齐。

Result: 在StorySalon和FlintStonesSV数据集上，ViSTA生成一致且与叙述文本对齐的图像序列。

Conclusion: ViSTA通过多模态历史适配器和显著历史选择策略，有效提升了视觉故事生成的连贯性和文本对齐性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet
generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains
challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image
pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual
information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive
methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training,
while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack
adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}.
It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant
history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the
extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection
strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is
selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to
employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image
alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable
assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV
dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different
frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.

### [4] [InceptionMamba: Efficient Multi-Stage Feature Enhancement with Selective State Space Model for Microscopic Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12208)
*Daniya Najiha Abdul Kareem,Abdul Hannan,Mubashir Noman,Jean Lahoud,Mustansar Fiaz,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为InceptionMamba的高效框架，用于医学图像分割，结合了Inception深度卷积和Mamba块，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN和Transformer模型在复杂细胞和组织结构分割中表现不佳，且依赖大数据集和高计算成本。

Method: 利用语义线索捕获多阶段特征，结合Inception深度卷积和Mamba块，融合低分辨率特征生成最终分割掩码。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能，计算成本降低约5倍。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba框架在医学图像分割中高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Accurate microscopic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in
diagnosing various cancerous cells and identifying tumors. Driven by
advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive
fields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often
struggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging
scenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their
reliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along
with the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these
issues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named
InceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both
performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic
cues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the
multi-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell
boundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines
an Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high
efficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the
regions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features
are fused to get the final segmentation mask. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two challenging microscopic segmentation
datasets (SegPC21 and GlaS) and two skin lesion segmentation datasets (ISIC2017
and ISIC2018), while reducing computational cost by about 5 times compared to
the previous best performing method.

### [5] [CLIP the Landscape: Automated Tagging of Crowdsourced Landscape Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12214)
*Ilya Ilyankou,Natchapon Jongwiriyanurak,Tao Cheng,James Haworth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP的多模态多标签分类器，用于从地理照片中预测地理标签，结合位置和标题嵌入提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地理照片中地理标签预测的挑战，尤其是在缺乏POI和街景的偏远地区。

Method: 结合CLIP预训练的图像和文本嵌入，使用简单的分类头进行训练。

Result: 结合位置和标题嵌入比仅使用图像嵌入提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于支持GeoAI应用中的位置嵌入任务，增强数据稀疏区域的空间理解。

Abstract: We present a CLIP-based, multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting
geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset--a
crowdsourced image archive spanning the British Isles, including remote regions
lacking POIs and street-level imagery. Our approach addresses a Kaggle
competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-geographic-context-from-landscape-photos}
task based on a subset of Geograph's 8M images, with strict evaluation: exact
match accuracy is required across 49 possible tags. We show that combining
location and title embeddings with image features improves accuracy over using
image embeddings alone. We release a lightweight
pipeline\footnote{https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/ClipTheLandscape} that trains
on a modest laptop, using pre-trained CLIP image and text embeddings and a
simple classification head. Predicted tags can support downstream tasks such as
building location embedders for GeoAI applications, enriching spatial
understanding in data-sparse regions.

*Mohammed Elhenawy,Shadi Jaradat,Taqwa I. Alhadidi,Huthaifa I. Ashqar,Ahmed Jaber,Andry Rakotonirainy,Mohammad Abu Tami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在零样本和上下文学习场景下的场景理解能力，发现GPT-4o表现最佳，但与小模型差距不大。集成方法效果不一，需更复杂技术优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动驾驶中的场景理解能力，以促进驾驶员与代理的沟通并增强自动驾驶决策的可解释性。

Method: 在零样本和上下文学习设置下测试四种MLLMs，并尝试通过多数投票的集成方法提升性能。

Result: GPT-4o表现最优，但与小模型差距较小；集成方法对部分场景属性有提升，但对其他属性有负面影响。

Conclusion: MLLMs在场景理解中潜力巨大，需进一步优化小模型和集成技术以提升自动驾驶应用性能。

Abstract: Scene understanding is critical for various downstream tasks in autonomous
driving, including facilitating driver-agent communication and enhancing
human-centered explainability of autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions. This paper
evaluates the capability of four multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
including relatively small models, to understand scenes in a zero-shot,
in-context learning setting. Additionally, we explore whether combining these
models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene
understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest
model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance
gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that
advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models'
performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while
some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score,
others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene
attributes. This study underscores the potential of leveraging MLLMs for scene
understanding and provides insights into optimizing their performance for
autonomous driving applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三平面的多摄像头标记化策略，显著减少了标记数量，提升了策略推理速度，同时保持了运动规划的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自回归Transformer在机器人及自动驾驶车辆策略架构中传感器数据标记化的效率问题，以适应嵌入式硬件的实时需求。

Method: 利用3D神经重建和渲染的最新进展，开发了一种三平面多摄像头标记化策略，该策略对输入摄像头数量及分辨率不敏感，并明确考虑其几何布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有基于图像块的标记化策略减少了72%的标记数量，策略推理速度提升了50%，同时保持了相同的运动规划精度，并在闭环驾驶模拟中提高了越野率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了标记化效率，为自动驾驶策略的实时部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end
robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their
scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for
generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to
ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware.
To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization
strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and
rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input
cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry
around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art
neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over
current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer
tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same
open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop
driving simulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了第一人称视角视频对佩戴者隐私的威胁，提出了EgoPrivacy基准和Retrieval-Augmented Attack方法，展示了隐私信息的高泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨第一人称视角视频中佩戴者隐私信息的泄露问题，填补了现有研究对佩戴者隐私威胁的忽视。

Method: 提出EgoPrivacy基准，涵盖三类隐私任务，并设计Retrieval-Augmented Attack方法，利用外部视频库增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，佩戴者的隐私信息（如身份、性别、种族等）在零样本设置下泄露准确率达70-80%。

Conclusion: 第一人称视角视频对佩戴者隐私构成显著威胁，需引起重视并采取防护措施。

Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant
concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the
unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the
core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be
inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the
first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks
in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic,
individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private
information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to
coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats
inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel
attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of
exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An
extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models
is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly
susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation
models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by
recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80%
accuracy. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/williamium3000/ego-privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高高通量表型分析的准确性，支持植物育种中的数据驱动决策。

Method: 集成无人机图像处理、用户引导标注、CNN模型训练、边界框投影和形状文件生成。

Result: 在玉米案例中，检测性能优异（验证AP：89.6%，测试AP：85.9%），性状提取与人工标注高度一致（r=0.87-0.97）。

Conclusion: MatchPlant为农业和环境监测提供了可扩展的植物级分析框架。

Abstract: Accurate identification of individual plants from unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) images is essential for advancing high-throughput phenotyping and
supporting data-driven decision-making in plant breeding. This study presents
MatchPlant, a modular, graphical user interface-supported, open-source Python
pipeline for UAV-based single-plant detection and geospatial trait extraction.
MatchPlant enables end-to-end workflows by integrating UAV image processing,
user-guided annotation, Convolutional Neural Network model training for object
detection, forward projection of bounding boxes onto an orthomosaic, and
shapefile generation for spatial phenotypic analysis. In an early-season maize
case study, MatchPlant achieved reliable detection performance (validation AP:
89.6%, test AP: 85.9%) and effectively projected bounding boxes, covering 89.8%
of manually annotated boxes with 87.5% of projections achieving an Intersection
over Union (IoU) greater than 0.5. Trait values extracted from predicted
bounding instances showed high agreement with manual annotations (r =
0.87-0.97, IoU >= 0.4). Detection outputs were reused across time points to
extract plant height and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with minimal
additional annotation, facilitating efficient temporal phenotyping. By
combining modular design, reproducibility, and geospatial precision, MatchPlant
offers a scalable framework for UAV-based plant-level analysis with broad
applicability in agricultural and environmental monitoring.

*Janet Wang,Yunbei Zhang,Zhengming Ding,Jihun Hamm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MAGIC的新框架，通过AI与专家协作生成医学上准确的皮肤疾病图像，显著提高了临床准确性并减少了人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据稀缺限制了诊断ML模型的泛化能力，现有扩散模型生成的图像医学准确性不足，需要专家知识来提升合成图像的质量。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉推理能力，将专家定义的标准转化为可操作的反馈，指导扩散模型生成临床准确的图像。

Result: 实验表明，合成的皮肤疾病图像临床质量显著提升，与皮肤科医生评估一致；数据增强后，诊断准确率在20种皮肤疾病分类任务中提高了9.02%，在少样本设置中提高了13.89%。

Conclusion: MAGIC框架通过AI与专家协作，有效提升了合成医学图像的临床准确性，为数据稀缺情况下的诊断模型提供了高质量的数据增强方案。

Abstract: Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML
models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a
small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been
considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and
augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images,
deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for
synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when
data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for
incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand
labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities,
making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel
framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through
AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease
images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined
criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly
improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload.
Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality
of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist
assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized
images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition
skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

*Yuantao Wang,Haowei Yang,Wei Zhang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDet-D是一个统一框架，用于解决多种恶劣天气条件下的物体检测问题，结合动态光谱注意力机制，提升特征表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体检测常因恶劣天气条件（如雨、雾、雪等）导致图像退化，现有方法泛化能力差且未能充分利用视觉特征。

Method: 提出UniDet-D框架，结合动态光谱注意力机制，自适应强调信息丰富的频谱成分，抑制无关部分。

Result: 实验表明UniDet-D在多种恶劣天气条件下检测精度高，且对未见过天气条件（如沙尘暴）泛化能力强。

Conclusion: UniDet-D在恶劣天气条件下具有强大的物体检测能力和实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured
images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse
weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive
prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of
adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of
visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a
theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather
images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of
object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object
detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the
proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that
adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing
irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation
across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D
achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather
degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards
unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures,
highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理IoT设备采集的损坏图像数据时鲁棒性低，且计算和传输资源消耗高。

Method: 使用数据无关的非线性变换函数生成多样化特征图，部分卷积滤波器作为种子滤波器，通过分组非线性处理生成特征图。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，鲁棒性和训练速度显著提升。

Conclusion: GroupNL方法有效提升了CNN模型的鲁棒性和训练效率。

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to
provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods
have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data
collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and
transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear
transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature
maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to
improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution
filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small
set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on
vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several
groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse
feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively
reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training
by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not
updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by
using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated
based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,
Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the
proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and
training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of
GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla
ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN
when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频数据的时空复杂性，videoLLMs在可信度方面面临事实错误、有害内容、偏见、幻觉和隐私风险等挑战，亟需系统评估。

Method: 研究提出了Trust-videoLLMs基准，包含30个任务，使用改编、合成和标注的视频数据，评估动态视觉场景、跨模态交互和现实安全问题。

Result: 评估了23个先进videoLLMs（5个商业模型，18个开源模型），发现其在动态视觉场景理解和跨模态扰动鲁棒性方面存在显著局限。开源模型在真实性上偶尔优于商业模型，但整体可信度较低。

commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual
scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source
videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall
credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的成员推理攻击方法ICIMIA，通过图像损坏和文本嵌入相似性检测训练数据中的敏感图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能涉及隐私风险，因此需要检测图像是否被用于训练。

Method: 设计了基于图像损坏的成员推理攻击（ICIMIA），包括白盒设置下的嵌入相似性攻击和黑盒设置下的文本嵌入相似性攻击。

Result: 实验验证了ICIMIA在两种设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: ICIMIA是一种简单但有效的成员推理攻击方法，适用于不同知识水平的攻击场景。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in many downstream tasks. However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale
datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive
information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to
train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality
content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to
train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired
Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LLVLMs, which are inspired by
LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member
images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we
can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target
LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and
its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we
have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs
with an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the
output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different
settings.

TL;DR: EKPC方法通过IPR和TSDC技术，解决了CIL中参数效率和模型灵活性之间的平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在CIL中要么增加内存使用，要么牺牲模型灵活性，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合IPR（重要性感知参数正则化）和TSDC（可训练语义漂移补偿），选择性约束参数更新并补偿语义漂移。

Result: 在五个CIL基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EKPC方法有效平衡了知识保留和新任务适应，提升了CIL性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously
learn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while
retaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter
tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either
introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid
regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model
flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge
Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware
Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC)
for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network
parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then
selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these
importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while
maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic
differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading
to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion,
TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过超参数优化和高级预处理技术，提升了诊断准确性和可靠性，推动了DL和ML在医学影像分析中的结合。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial in medical imaging to ensure
reliable diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This study introduces a
novel double ensembling framework that synergistically combines pre-trained
deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction with optimized machine
learning (ML) classifiers for robust classification. The framework incorporates
comprehensive preprocessing and data augmentation of brain magnetic resonance
images (MRI), followed by deep feature extraction using transfer learning with
pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) networks. The novelty lies in the
dual-level ensembling strategy: feature-level ensembling, which integrates deep
features from the top-performing ViT models, and classifier-level ensembling,
which aggregates predictions from hyperparameter-optimized ML classifiers.
Experiments on two public Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrate that this
approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the
importance of feature and classifier fusion. The proposed methodology also
highlights the critical roles of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and advanced
preprocessing techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability,
advancing the integration of DL and ML for clinically relevant medical image
analysis.

Result: 在多种基准测试中，LARGO在域内外均表现优异，计算开销显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: LARGO是一种高效且鲁棒的参数微调方法，适用于域偏移场景。

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly
reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to
diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to
achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational
efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient
Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank
adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable
gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the
Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer
independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating
the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.
Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights
for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization
strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance
across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved
robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead
compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: Perceptual-GS通过集成人类感知敏感性，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the
distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it
challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human
perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian
Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual
sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first
introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual
sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on
this foundation, we develop a \cameraready{perceptual sensitivity-adaptive
distribution} to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical
regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations
on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate
that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction
quality, efficiency, and robustness. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有CNN和ViT在VPR任务中各有优势但难以结合，需要一种方法整合两者的优势。

Method: 设计了并行CNN-ViT混合架构和DFM模块，并在ViT分支中引入轻量级频率-空间融合适配器。

Result: 在多个VPR基准数据集上，LGCN在定位准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGCN通过局部-全局特征互补和动态融合，有效提升了VPR任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization
and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations
that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature
extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are
effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited
for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of
both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation
network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture
with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature
fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch
for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters
into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation
with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms
existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在持续学习中面临参数效率、内存消耗和优化稳定性的挑战，传统的一阶优化方法（如SGD）容易陷入局部最优且内存开销大。

Method: 选择性在视觉或语言模态中应用ZO优化，保留FO优化在另一模态；提出分层优化范式，结合ZO和FO；引入梯度符号归一化机制。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优异，内存消耗比基线减少89.1%。

Conclusion: 通过模态特定的优化策略和分层优化，实现了高效且稳定的视觉语言持续学习。

Abstract: Continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) faces critical challenges
in balancing parameter efficiency, memory consumption, and optimization
stability. While First-Order (FO) optimization (e.g., SGD) dominate current
approaches, their deterministic gradients often trap models in suboptimal local
minima and incur substantial memory overhead. This paper pioneers a systematic
exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual
learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO
adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we
selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining
FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise
optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers,
capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep
representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in
vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a
gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation
constraints. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing memory consumption by
89.1% compared to baselines. Code will be available upon publication.

Conclusion: DG-ReID是一个重要但尚未充分探索的领域，本文为其研究提供了基础框架和未来发展的潜在路径。

Abstract: Person Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same
individual captured across non-overlapping camera views, making it a critical
component of intelligent surveillance systems. Traditional ReID methods assume
that the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily
focus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they
often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by
variations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this
issue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These
approaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve
performance by aligning feature distributions between source and target
domains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and
challenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without
relying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various
strategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID
including the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source
input configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization
modules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and
identity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability
of these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that
also involves distribution shifts. Finally, we discuss recent trends, open
challenges, and promising directions for future research in DG-ReID. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey dedicated to
DG-ReID.

Conclusion: CLIP-HandID为犯罪调查提供了一种高效的手部图像身份识别解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to person identification based on hand
images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is
particularly valuable in serious crimes like sexual abuse, where hand images
are often the sole identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method,
CLIP-HandID, leverages pre-trained foundational vision-language model,
particularly CLIP, to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature
representations from hand images given as input to the image encoder of CLIP
using textual prompts as semantic guidance. We propose to learn pseudo-tokens
that represent specific visual contexts or appearance attributes using textual
inversion network since labels of hand images are indexes instead text
descriptions. The learned pseudo-tokens are incorporated into textual prompts
which are given as input to the text encoder of the CLIP to leverage its
multi-modal reasoning to enhance its generalization for identification. Through
extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with
multi-ethnic representation, we show that our method substantially surpasses
existing approaches.

Abstract: This study presents a novel demographics informed deep learning framework
designed to forecast urban spatial transformations by jointly modeling
geographic satellite imagery, socio-demographics, and travel behavior dynamics.
The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture with temporal gated
residual connections, integrating satellite imagery and demographic data to
accurately forecast future spatial transformations. The study also introduces a
demographics prediction component which ensures that predicted satellite
imagery are consistent with demographic features, significantly enhancing
physiological realism and socioeconomic accuracy. The framework is enhanced by
a proposed multi-objective loss function complemented by a semantic loss
function that balances visual realism with temporal coherence. The experimental
results from this study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
model compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving higher structural
similarity (SSIM: 0.8342) and significantly improved demographic consistency
(Demo-loss: 0.14 versus 0.95 and 0.96 for baseline models). Additionally, the
study validates co-evolutionary theories of urban development, demonstrating
quantifiable bidirectional influences between built environment characteristics

Motivation: 图像边缘检测中训练与推理的连续输出与二值预测不匹配，导致学习目标与实际任务性能脱节。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上验证了BAA的有效性。

Conclusion: BAA为结构化预测任务中连续优化与离散评估的差距提供了一种通用策略。

Abstract: Image edge detection (ED) faces a fundamental mismatch between training and
inference: models are trained using continuous-valued outputs but evaluated
using binary predictions. This misalignment, caused by the
non-differentiability of binarization, weakens the link between learning
objectives and actual task performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
method to design a Binarization-Aware Adjuster (BAA), which explicitly
incorporates binarization behavior into gradient-based optimization. At the
core of BAA is a novel loss adjustment mechanism based on a Distance Weight
Function (DWF), which reweights pixel-wise contributions according to their
correctness and proximity to the decision boundary. This emphasizes
decision-critical regions while down-weighting less influential ones. We also
introduce a self-adaptive procedure to estimate the optimal binarization
threshold for BAA, further aligning training dynamics with inference behavior.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Beyond ED, BAA offers a generalizable strategy
for bridging the gap between continuous optimization and discrete evaluation in
structured prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频TTA方法主要依赖视觉信号，忽略了音频数据的潜在贡献。

Method: 通过预训练音频模型分类音频信号，利用大语言模型将音频预测映射到视频标签空间，生成音频辅助伪标签，并结合灵活的适应周期优化适应过程。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括新构建的音频-视频TTA数据集）上验证了方法的优越性，显著提升了不同视频分类模型的适应性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频TTA中整合音频信息提供了重要进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a
trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing
phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual
supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent
audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates
audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic
content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the
context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping
method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals
extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video
label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection
between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the
generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines
the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes
in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized
adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used
datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed
audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves
adaptation performance across different video classification models and
represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into
video TTA. Code: https://github.com/keikeiqi/Audio-Assisted-TTA.

Method: 比较了自定义CNN、预训练Transformer模型和AutoML解决方案，并分析了数据增强对不同架构模型的影响。

Result: 数据增强显著提升纯ViT模型的性能，但对混合ViT-CNN模型有负面影响；小patch尺寸的ViT在增强数据上表现更好；DINOv2模型在增强数据下表现提升。

Conclusion: 模型架构、数据增强和数据集大小之间存在复杂的相互作用，需根据具体任务选择合适的策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for
detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the
HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a
custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML
solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data
augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision
Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive
biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features.
Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid
ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may
be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes
(ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2
fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation,
highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential.
Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring
the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.
This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model
architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image
classification.

immersive images. However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for
bandwidth efficiency and compression techniques.
  Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image
quality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual
differences are subtle.
  To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset,
comprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed
using four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity
range, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually
lossless threshold.
  A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology,
combining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were
collected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results
confirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\% confidence
intervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND. In addition, several recently
proposed objective metrics were evaluated based on their correlation with
subjective ratings. The dataset is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法缺乏用户意图的明确指导，导致聚类结果可能不符合用户需求。

Method: 提出ITGC方法，利用迭代发现过程和无监督聚类目标生成视觉概念。

Result: 在多种图像聚类和细粒度分类基准上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITGC通过自然语言指令更好地捕捉用户意图，提供更符合需求的聚类结果。

Abstract: Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on
their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of
additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different,
yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use
different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color.
Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this
ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural
language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and
control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent.
We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an
iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to
generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria
expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to
existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained
classification benchmarks.

Motivation: 现实世界的数据通常呈现长尾分布，但现有GCD研究假设数据分布均匀，导致在长尾分布下的性能不佳。

Method: 采用自信样本选择和密度聚类的方法，解决分类器学习和类别数量估计的挑战。

Result: 在长尾和传统GCD数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在长尾分布下的GCD任务中表现优异，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
under a long-tailed distribution, which involves discovering novel categories
in an unlabelled dataset using knowledge from a set of labelled categories.
Existing works assume a uniform distribution for both datasets, but real-world
data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where a few categories contain
most examples, while others have only a few. While the long-tailed distribution
is well-studied in supervised and semi-supervised settings, it remains
unexplored in the GCD context. We identify two challenges in this setting -
balancing classifier learning and estimating category numbers - and propose a
framework based on confident sample selection and density-based clustering to
tackle them. Our experiments on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的推理时间细化框架，用于提升事件驱动眼动追踪模型的输出质量，无需修改模型架构或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件驱动眼动追踪在认知状态推断中具有高时间分辨率和抗运动伪影的优势，但现有模型的输出存在噪声和不连续性，影响下游任务。

Method: 通过两个后处理模块（运动感知中值滤波和光流局部细化）优化眼动信号，并提出新的抖动度量标准评估时间平滑性。

Result: 在多个基线模型上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了眼动信号的连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为事件驱动眼动追踪在真实环境中的多模态情感识别系统集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive
state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion
artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as
attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic,
inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing
event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or
requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)
Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while
preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,
which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial
jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy
metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness
of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal
complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency
of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks
such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on
controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with
multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

Result: 实验表明，方法有效减少了不连续性，生成了高质量且视觉一致的修复结果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了图像修复的连贯性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an
image in a way that seamlessly blends with the surrounding content. With the
advent of advanced generative models, especially diffusion models and
generative adversarial networks, inpainting has achieved remarkable
improvements in visual quality and coherence. However, achieving seamless
continuity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose two novel
methods to address discrepancy issues in diffusion-based inpainting models.
First, we introduce a modified Variational Autoencoder that corrects color
imbalances, ensuring that the final inpainted results are free of color
mismatches. Second, we propose a two-step training strategy that improves the
blending of generated and existing image content during the diffusion process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods effectively
reduce discontinuity and produce high-quality inpainting results that are
coherent and visually appealing.

Motivation: 冻结步态（FoG）是帕金森病患者的常见症状，实时识别FoG有助于改善患者的治疗和管理。

Method: 使用Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM融合模型分析加速度计数据，区分FoG事件和正常运动。

Result: 模型在Kaggle数据集上达到92.6%准确率、80.9% F1分数和52.06%平均精度。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在FoG识别领域具有潜力，可为帕金森病患者提供更好的治疗方案。

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a special symptom found in patients with
Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients who have FoG abruptly lose the capacity to
walk as they normally would. Accelerometers worn by patients can record
movement data during these episodes, and machine learning algorithms can be
useful to categorize this information. Thus, the combination may be able to
identify FoG in real time. In order to identify FoG events in accelerometer
data, we introduce the Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model in this paper.
The model's capability to differentiate between FoG episodes and normal
movement was used to evaluate its performance, and on the Kaggle Parkinson's
Freezing of Gait dataset, the proposed Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model
produced 92.6% accuracy, 80.9% F1 score, and 52.06% in terms of mean average
precision. The findings highlight how Deep Learning-based approaches may
progress the field of FoG identification and help PD patients receive better
treatments and management plans.

TL;DR: 传统图像相似度指标在评估真实场景图像与人工生成视角之间的相似性时效果不佳。研究评估了新的感知相似度指标DreamSim及三种流行指标（SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS）在新视角合成（NVS）中的表现。结果表明，DreamSim在区分细微像素变化与严重损坏时更稳健，且更适用于实际应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像相似度指标无法有效区分真实图像与人工生成视角的相似性，尤其在NVS应用中表现不佳。

Method: 通过创建人工损坏图像集，量化评估DreamSim、SSIM、PSNR和LPIPS的敏感性和区分能力。

Result: DreamSim在区分细微像素变化与严重损坏时表现更优，且更适用于实际NVS渲染质量评估。

Conclusion: DreamSim是一种更有效的图像相似度指标，尤其适用于NVS等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Traditional image similarity metrics are ineffective at evaluating the
similarity between a real image of a scene and an artificially generated
version of that viewpoint [6, 9, 13, 14]. Our research evaluates the
effectiveness of a new, perceptual-based similarity metric, DreamSim [2], and
three popular image similarity metrics: Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS) [18, 19] in novel view synthesis (NVS) applications. We create a corpus
of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative
power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that
traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with
minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas
DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the
high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that
DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality,
especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight
rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human
tasks.

TL;DR: MVP-CBM通过多层视觉偏好增强的概念瓶颈模型，解决了传统CBM方法中概念偏好变化的问题，提升了模型解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBM方法仅将概念与视觉编码器的最后一层关联，忽视了概念在不同层的偏好变化，导致解释性和准确性下降。

Method: 提出MVP-CBM，包含两个模块：1) 层内概念偏好建模，捕捉不同概念与各层特征的关联；2) 多层概念稀疏激活融合，稀疏聚合多层概念激活以增强性能。

Result: 在多个医学分类基准测试中，MVP-CBM实现了最先进的准确性和互操作性。

Conclusion: MVP-CBM通过显式建模概念偏好，全面利用多层视觉信息，提供了更细致和准确的模型决策解释。

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability
via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and
life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM
methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain
the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of
concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated
with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a
blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and
thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,
impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),
which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference
modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with
features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse
activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple
layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept
preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual
information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model
decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at

TL;DR: DejaVid是一种无需重新训练或修改架构的编码器无关方法，通过将视频转换为可变长度的时间序列嵌入，显著提升了视频分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视频编码器模型通过平均多个片段的嵌入输出来生成固定长度表示，忽略了时间相关特征（如视频时长、事件顺序、特征重要性变化）。现有方法需要昂贵的架构修改和重新训练。

Method: DejaVid将视频转换为可变长度的多变量时间序列（MTS），保留时间顺序并适应不同视频时长。通过学习每个时间步和特征的权重，动态调整特征重要性。

Result: DejaVid显著提升了性能，在Something-Something V2、Kinetics-400和HMDB51数据集上分别达到77.2%、89.1%和88.6%的Top-1准确率，仅增加1.8%的可学习参数和不到3小时的训练时间。

Conclusion: DejaVid是一种高效且轻量化的方法，能够在不改变现有编码器架构的情况下显著提升视频分类性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large transformer-based video encoder models have greatly
advanced state-of-the-art performance on video classification tasks. However,
these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from
multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach
fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video
durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature
significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require
significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them
impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model
performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our
framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of
embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally
preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then
learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing
us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a
new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment
algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid
substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,
achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on
Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional
learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time. Our code

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在视觉幻觉（VH）问题，即对视觉内容产生错误描述。

Method: VisFlow通过两种推理时干预方法（TAI和HAI）直接调整注意力模式，解决视觉基础弱、语言先验主导和提示冗余问题。

Result: 实验表明，VisFlow显著减少幻觉并提高视觉事实性，且计算成本极低。

Conclusion: VisFlow是一种高效且无需修改模型的解决方案，有效缓解了LVLMs中的视觉幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they remain prone to visual
hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of
visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework
designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during
inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological
attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to
visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative
regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior
response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal
alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system
prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response
content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time
interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus
on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which
suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates
without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments
across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces
hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational
cost.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of
significant computational resources. This has created an urgent need for a
novel and energy-efficient computational fabric. CMOS Oscillator Networks
(OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed hardware for low energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose a Hopfield Network based machine
learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The network is trained
using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected weights, yet
achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deep learning
models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive accuracy on MNIST and
is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible ring oscillator arrays
with SHIL. In oscillator-based implementation, we utilize only 24% of the
connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with merely a 0.1% drop
in accuracy. OscNet v1.5 relies solely on forward propagation and employs
sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient machine learning pipeline
designed for CMOS oscillator computing. The repository for OscNet family is:

Abstract: We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to
provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions
and key video frames. We observe that existing benchmarks focus on generic
semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing
step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are
crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user
interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a
dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These
videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and
video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and
executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our
collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal
summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the
importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching
for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve
performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the
resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these
reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize
the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple
datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for
text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance
plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to
achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅有效修复畸形手部，还增加了任务的灵活性和多样性。

Abstract: The malformed hands in the AI-generated images seriously affect the
authenticity of the images. To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based
approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed
hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many
hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands,
such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we
propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We
use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of
the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB
images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to
generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a
double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain
robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand
refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases
the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made
the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose
transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

*Yuxiang Wang,Xuecheng Bai,Boyu Hu,Chuanzhi Xu,Haodong Chen,Vera Chung,Tingxue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGDFIS是一种多尺度全局-细节特征融合策略，用于无人机图像中的小目标检测，显著提升性能并保持高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的小目标检测因目标尺寸小、信噪比低和特征提取有限而具有挑战性，现有方法计算负担重且模糊细节。

Method: MGDFIS包含三个模块：FusionLock-TSS注意力模块、全局-细节集成模块和动态像素注意力模块，分别用于增强特征、融合多尺度上下文和优化像素权重。

Result: 在VisDrone基准测试中，MGDFIS优于现有方法，实现高精度和低推理时间。

Conclusion: MGDFIS在精度和资源使用之间取得平衡，为资源受限的无人机平台提供实用的小目标检测方案。

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as
search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it
is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited
feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add
computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in
cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified
fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost
detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three
synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries
token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight
spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration
Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and
parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and
the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps
to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen
responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone
benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,
achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an
optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a
practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV
platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用OOD数据和对比学习，显著提升了长尾数据集上的自监督学习性能。

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a
long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated
representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is
crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their
distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a
class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using
unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.
We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by
back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a
domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are
designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,
we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning
while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding
network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the
strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also
distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain
balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available
long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像模态上容易受到对抗攻击，存在安全隐患。

Result: 在多种数据集和攻击类型下，NAP-Tuning显著优于现有方法，在AutoAttack基准测试中提升33.5%（ViT-B16）和33.0%（ViT-B32）。

Conclusion: NAP-Tuning通过多模态提示和特征净化，有效提升了视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data
through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality,
posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to
enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we
present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework
for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations
include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across
both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer
prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign
through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to
directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature
space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to
reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for
modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing
methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows
significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging
AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on
ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: The segmentation of coal maceral groups can be described as a semantic
segmentation process of coal maceral group images, which is of great
significance for studying the chemical properties of coal. Generally, existing
semantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking
parameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational
requirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to
the professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling,
obtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and
professional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively
developed an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model,
we can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained
improvement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we
decouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal
using of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA
mechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of
coal microscopic images. This DCSA can decompose the large kernels of
convolutional attention into multiple scales and reduce 81.18% of
parameters.Finally, we performed the contrast experiment and ablation
experiment between DA-VIT and state-of-the-art methods at lots of evaluation
metrics. Experimental results show that DA-VIT-Base achieves 92.14% pixel
accuracy and 63.18% mIoU. Params and FLOPs of DA-VIT-Tiny are 4.95M and 8.99G,
respectively. All of the evaluation metrics of the proposed DA-VIT are better
than other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在孤立对象的新视图合成上表现良好，但在复杂、杂乱场景中表现不佳。

Method: GenMOJO将场景分解为单个对象，优化每个对象的可变形高斯集，并利用对象中心扩散模型推断新视角中的未观察区域。

Result: GenMOJO生成更真实的新场景视图和更准确的点轨迹。

Conclusion: GenMOJO在复杂场景中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular,
multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel
approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization
with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well
on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to
complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into
individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per
object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric
diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs
joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object
occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between
object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,
GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering
constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object
reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point
tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human
studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and
produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: SP-VLA框架通过联合调度模型和剪枝token，加速VLA模型，减少时空冗余，实现高效实时控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算成本高、执行频率低，无法满足实时任务需求，且现有加速方法忽视序列决策环境中的冗余问题。

Method: 提出动作感知的模型调度机制和空间语义双感知token剪枝方法，动态切换VLA模型与轻量生成器，分类并剪枝token。

Result: 实验显示，方法最高加速1.5倍，精度下降小于3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SP-VLA有效减少冗余，保持高精度，适用于实时任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型（MLLMs）采用静态模态融合策略，无法适应实例级可靠性或语义贡献，导致性能不佳。

Method: DMS基于置信度、不确定性和语义一致性动态调整模态权重，并引入模态权重一致性损失稳定训练。

Result: 在VQA、图像-文本检索和字幕生成任务中，DMS显著提升了干净和鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: DMS为多模态建模提供了一种通用且有效的实例感知和鲁棒性增强机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
vision-language understanding and generation tasks. However, existing MLLMs
typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities
equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic
contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities.
  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel
framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a
per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1)
\textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2)
\textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3)
\textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These
signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate
soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we
further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which
regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings
proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can
be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental
results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS
significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under
modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and
effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal
modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视图训练在3DGS中导致随机梯度方差大，优化效果不佳，需多视图训练。但直接多视图训练存在开销大和密度控制问题。

Method: 改进光栅化以减少多视图训练开销，提出3D距离感知D-SSIM损失和多视图自适应密度控制。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著提升3DGS及其变体性能，摆脱单视图训练限制。

Conclusion: 多视图训练方法有效解决了3DGS的优化问题，提升了渲染效果和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a preferred choice alongside
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in inverse rendering due to its superior
rendering speed. Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize
"single-view" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per
iteration, in contrast to NeRF's "multi-view" mini-batch training, which
leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead
to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic
gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,
implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering
multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in
suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view
assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to
minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D
distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better
suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing
3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.

Conclusion: MA-AFS展示了自适应融合的重要性，为可靠且不确定性感知的多模态学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide
range of vision-language tasks. However, existing approaches often adopt fixed
or task-specific fusion strategies, neglecting the intrinsic variability of
modality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose
Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that
learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a
per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that
predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy
signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to
adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing,
or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable
scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization
effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model
capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval,
captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent
performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP.
Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and
enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance
of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and
uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.

Motivation: 现有特征编码方法多为特定架构设计（如CNN或Transformer），无法适应异构架构特征共存的现实场景，因此需要一种通用的跨架构特征编码方法。

Method: 提出两步分布对齐方法：1）格式对齐，将CNN和Transformer特征统一为2D token格式；2）特征值对齐，通过截断和归一化协调统计分布。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，该方法在率-精度权衡上优于特定架构的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作是实现异构模型架构间通用特征压缩的初步尝试，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Feature coding has become increasingly important in scenarios where semantic
representations rather than raw pixels are transmitted and stored. However,
most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or
Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios
where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we
introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding
(CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress
features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment
method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token
format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes
statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt
to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This
work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across
heterogeneous model architectures.

Conclusion: 自适应Dropout有效提升了盲超分辨率模型的泛化能力，为其他图像修复任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization
ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting
issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances
generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind
SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before
the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at
intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at
intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized
feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying
dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which
we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it
introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method
for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates
application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for
training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate
the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in
generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an
adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise
annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past
regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,
also highly effective in other image restoration tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset
often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a
robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present
during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We
propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models
to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two
sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance
classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an
object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features.
It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts,
enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we
incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation
performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures
category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby
enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in
various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously
achieving precise, universal, robust and efficient performance due to extremely
dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to
leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal
domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while
incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more
essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through
theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and
correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant
superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate
whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks,
we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the
importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above
conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal
anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network
(DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST
detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the
effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our
DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on
widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a
significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a
new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which
can promote the development of IRST detection. Codes are available at

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous
advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as
the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method
based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical
two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and
sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module
(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on
land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add
prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby
reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore
detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection
and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration
of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR
ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the
input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land
segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation
information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We
conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which
demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理多样分辨率和宽高比的真实图像时表现不佳，且缺乏系统性评估基准。

Method: 引入RC-Bench基准和NativeRes-LLaVA框架，支持原生分辨率视觉编码。

Result: 实验表明，原生分辨率视觉编码显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率视觉编码是提升视觉语言模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with
the diverse resolutions and aspect ratios of real-world images, as most
existing models rely on fixed, low-resolution inputs. While recent studies have
explored integrating native resolution visual encoding to improve model
performance, such efforts remain fragmented and lack a systematic framework
within the open-source community. Moreover, existing benchmarks fall short in
evaluating VLMs under varied visual conditions, often neglecting resolution as
a critical factor. To address the "Resolution Dilemma" stemming from both model
design and benchmark limitations, we introduce RC-Bench, a novel benchmark
specifically designed to systematically evaluate VLM capabilities under extreme
visual conditions, with an emphasis on resolution and aspect ratio variations.
In conjunction, we propose NativeRes-LLaVA, an open-source training framework
that empowers VLMs to effectively process images at their native resolutions
and aspect ratios. Based on RC-Bench and NativeRes-LLaVA, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on existing visual encoding strategies. The results
show that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the
performance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.

the DLVS3-HST-V1 dataset, which focuses on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as
a complex, articulated target. The dataset is generated using advanced
real-time and offline rendering technologies, integrating high-fidelity 3D

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的移动通信中的多媒体服务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks demands unprecedented levels of intelligence,
adaptability, and efficiency to address challenges such as ultra-high-speed
data transmission, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity in dynamic
environments. Traditional wireless image transmission frameworks, reliant on
static configurations and isolated source-channel coding, struggle to balance
computational efficiency, robustness, and quality under fluctuating channel
conditions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an AI-native deep joint
source-channel coding (JSCC) framework tailored for resource-constrained 6G
networks. Our approach integrates key information extraction and adaptive
background synthesis to enable intelligent, semantic-aware transmission.
Leveraging AI-driven tools, Mediapipe for human pose detection and Rembg for
background removal, the model dynamically isolates foreground features and
matches backgrounds from a pre-trained library, reducing data payloads while
preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional
JSCC method, especially under low-SNR conditions. This approach offers a
practical solution for multimedia services in resource-constrained mobile
communications.

TL;DR: SwiftWRF利用高斯泼溅技术高效建模无线辐射场，实现快速准确的频谱合成和信号预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法精度有限或依赖强场景先验，NeRF方法计算成本高，难以实时部署。

Method: 提出SwiftWRF框架，结合可变形2D高斯泼溅和轻量级MLP，支持单侧收发器移动下的频谱合成。

Result: 实验显示SwiftWRF比现有方法快500倍，信号质量显著提升。

Conclusion: SwiftWRF为无线辐射场建模提供了高效解决方案，适用于定位和信道估计等任务。

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern
communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and
channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or
physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong
scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve
reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their
reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries
hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in
modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF
reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian
splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated
rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP
to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing
mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the
efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor
scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster
than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its
signal quality. Code and datasets will be released.

Conclusion: SEHR通过几何先验和辅助网络改进，提升了单视图3D人体重建的精度。

Abstract: Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D
digital human by inputting a monocular 2D image. Existing approaches include
feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based
methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we
propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR)
framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human
geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a
preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of
two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map
Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network
to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by
constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEHR outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) datasets have become
the Kernel of Digital Health Research by providing freely accessible,
deidentified records from tens of thousands of critical care admissions,
enabling a broad spectrum of applications in clinical decision support, outcome
prediction, and healthcare analytics. Although numerous studies and surveys
have explored the predictive power and clinical utility of MIMIC based models,
critical challenges in data integration, representation, and interoperability
remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that focuses
uniquely on open problems. We identify persistent issues such as data
granularity, cardinality limitations, heterogeneous coding schemes, and ethical
constraints that hinder the generalizability and real-time implementation of
machine learning models. We highlight key progress in dimensionality reduction,
temporal modelling, causal inference, and privacy preserving analytics, while
also outlining promising directions including hybrid modelling, federated
learning, and standardized preprocessing pipelines. By critically examining
these structural limitations and their implications, this survey offers
actionable insights to guide the next generation of MIMIC powered digital

Conclusion: Rehazy策略有效提升了去雾性能和训练稳定性，为真实场景去雾提供了新思路。

Abstract: Overfitting to synthetic training pairs remains a critical challenge in image
dehazing, leading to poor generalization capability to real-world scenarios. To
address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for
training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their
progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in
limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training
strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing
performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of
the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs
for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct
hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which
is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images.
Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch
framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic
dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the
generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new
dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which
progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments
on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach,
exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor
dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR. Our code will be
publicly available.

Motivation: 当前剪枝方法通过迭代搜索确定最优策略，计算开销大，难以适应多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的部署需求。

Method: LOP训练自回归神经网络直接预测适应目标剪枝约束的层剪枝策略，无需迭代搜索。

Result: 实验表明，LOP在多项任务中优于现有剪枝方法，且速度提升高达三个数量级。

Conclusion: LOP为MLLMs的高效剪枝提供了一种快速且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to
cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal
strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial
computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this
challenge, we propose LOP, an efficient neural pruning framework that learns
optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains
autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning
strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks
show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics
while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.

Result: 实验证明ComplexBench-Edit能有效区分模型能力，且提出的CoT方法显著提升了模型处理复杂编辑任务的表现。

Conclusion: ComplexBench-Edit和CoT方法为复杂图像编辑任务提供了有效的评估和改进工具。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing has achieved remarkable success in following single
instructions. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step
instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are
interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and
existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they
often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common
consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce
ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model
performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing
tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation
method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based
approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow
complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's
efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior
performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits. The data and

Result: 在ShapeNet上实验表明，DiffS-NOCS实现了与草图对齐的精细点云重建。

Conclusion: DiffS-NOCS通过多模态融合和多视图信息交换，显著提升了3D重建的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D point cloud from a given conditional sketch is
challenging. Existing methods often work directly in 3D space, but domain
variability and difficulty in reconstructing accurate 3D structures from 2D
sketches remain significant obstacles. Moreover, ideal models should also
accept prompts for control, in addition with the sparse sketch, posing
challenges in multi-modal fusion. We propose DiffS-NOCS (Diffusion-based
Sketch-to-NOCS Map), which leverages ControlNet with a modified multi-view
decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position
information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by
combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch
understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint
features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation
network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange
and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet
demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud
reconstruction aligned with sketches.

Conclusion: HyRet-Change通过多尺度特征集成和交互机制，有效提升了复杂场景中的变化检测能力。

Abstract: Recently convolution and transformer-based change detection (CD) methods
provide promising performance. However, it remains unclear how the local and
global dependencies interact to effectively alleviate the pseudo changes.
Moreover, directly utilizing standard self-attention presents intrinsic
limitations including governing global feature representations limit to capture
subtle changes, quadratic complexity, and restricted training parallelism. To
address these limitations, we propose a Siamese-based framework, called
HyRet-Change, which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and
retention mechanisms at multi-scale features to preserve critical information
and enhance adaptability in complex scenes. Specifically, we introduce a novel
feature difference module to exploit both convolutions and multi-head retention
mechanisms in a parallel manner to capture complementary information.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive local-global interactive context awareness
mechanism that enables mutual learning and enhances discrimination capability
through information exchange. We perform experiments on three challenging CD
datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present our solution to the MiGA Challenge at IJCAI 2025, which aims to
recognize micro-gestures (MGs) from skeleton sequences for the purpose of
hidden emotion understanding. MGs are characterized by their subtlety, short
duration, and low motion amplitude, making them particularly challenging to

three key enhancements: (1) a topology-aware skeleton representation
specifically designed for the iMiGUE dataset to better capture fine-grained
motion patterns; (2) an improved temporal processing strategy that facilitates
smoother and more temporally consistent motion modeling; and (3) the
incorporation of semantic label embeddings as auxiliary supervision to improve
the model generalization. Our method achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 67.01\% on

Conclusion: CAPO框架和Med-Zero-17K数据集为医学视觉问答提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses
relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data,
logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent
answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general
vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model
performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two
fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and
reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer
generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets
for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a
curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image
modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL
framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which
integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning,
consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for
final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines,
showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and
R1-like training paradigms.

Conclusion: 提出的DiT方法在视频修复任务中表现出色，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of
computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or
corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on
flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches
face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and
ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when
dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas
remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel
video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT
synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer
architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring
high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy
to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.
Additionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,
interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.
In terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA
A100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \times 1920$ with 121
frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture
restoration, and temporal consistency. Project page:

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly propelled the development
of image forgery localization. However, existing models remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks: imperceptible noise added to forged images
can severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge
with an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive
perturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe
that forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged
images exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Forgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy,
which reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise
Kullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the
defensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed
Mask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR
ensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and
original forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their
original level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms
demonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization
model's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to
original forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery
localization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本在频域中的特性，以揭示其对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 通过分析对抗样本和自然样本在频域中的表现差异，研究不同频率成分对模型性能的影响。

Result: 发现高、中、低频成分在不同网络架构中表现出不同的攻击效果，频率差异直接影响模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不同网络架构对频率成分的偏好不同，研究结果为AI模型安全提供了参考。

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet
understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In
this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in
the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key
findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap
between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2)
The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases
to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural
Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit
their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency
components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results
suggest that different network architectures have different frequency
preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial
and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our
findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a
valuable reference to the AI model security community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生长度日（GDD）的采样策略，用于作物分类，显著提高了跨季节分类精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖固定日历日采样，无法适应年际气候变化和实时应用需求，且缺乏不确定性量化。

Method: 利用生长度日（GDD）替代日历时间，在生物意义的时间域内均匀采样，减少冗余和噪声。

Result: 在多年度Sentinel-2数据集上验证，分类精度显著提升，不确定性估计更可靠，尤其在低数据量和早季分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: 温度数据的利用不仅提升了跨季节预测性能，还增强了作物分类在实际应用中的鲁棒性和可信度。

Abstract: Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite
time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely
on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons,
where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and
precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable.
Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such
approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by
ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,
model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD),
based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time.
By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain,
the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing
temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year
Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season
and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our
method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically,
produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in
low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season
classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses
the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty
estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a
baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging
temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but
also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构保持块（SPPs）的神经视频表示方法，通过重新排列帧为空间结构块帧，提升重建质量和压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀块划分在块边界处可能导致不连续性，影响全局结构一致性。

Method: 使用类似PixelUnshuffle的操作将帧重新排列为空间结构块帧，网络学习预测这些块帧，支持全局到局部的拟合策略。

Result: 在标准视频数据集上，该方法在重建质量和压缩性能上优于现有基于INR的视频表示方法。

Conclusion: SPPs方法有效解决了块边界不连续性问题，提升了视频表示的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have attracted significant interest
for their ability to model complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal
coordinates to signal values. In the context of neural video representation,
several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and
reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise
methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based
models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional
uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as
independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global
structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation
method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges
each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a
PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial
coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The
network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a
global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by
upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed
method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to
existing INR-based video representation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Metropolis-Hastings的自适应采样框架，用于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），通过多视角光度误差信号优化高斯分布，减少冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法依赖启发式密度控制机制（如克隆、分裂和修剪），可能导致冗余计算或过早移除有用高斯分布。

Method: 将密度控制和修剪重新定义为概率采样过程，基于多视角误差和不透明度分数动态调整高斯分布，并通过贝叶斯接受测试指导。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了所需高斯数量，提升了计算效率，同时保持或略微超越现有最佳模型的视图合成质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率采样减少对启发式方法的依赖，自适应推断高斯分布，显著提升了3DGS的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a
unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on
heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and
pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of
beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by
reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process,
dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view
errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from
these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance
on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian
distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on
benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep
Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed,
enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the
view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

Result: 在DCA-1数据集上，BAVT在医学图像分割指标上表现优于CNN和混合基线模型。

Conclusion: BAVT展示了结合普通ViT编码器和边界感知监督在临床级血管分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular structures in coronary angiography remains
a core challenge in medical image analysis due to the complexity of elongated,
thin, and low-contrast vessels. Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
often fail to preserve topological continuity, while recent Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based models, although strong in global context modeling, lack precise
boundary awareness. In this work, we introduce BAVT, a Boundary-Aware Vision
Transformer, a ViT-based architecture enhanced with an edge-aware loss that
explicitly guides the segmentation toward fine-grained vascular boundaries.
Unlike hybrid transformer-CNN models, BAVT retains a minimal, scalable
structure that is fully compatible with large-scale vision foundation model
(VFM) pretraining. We validate our approach on the DCA-1 coronary angiography
dataset, where BAVT achieves superior performance across medical image
segmentation metrics outperforming both CNN and hybrid baselines. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining plain ViT encoders with
boundary-aware supervision for clinical-grade vascular segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在医学应用中多尺度学习不足，而分层表示对医学诊断有益。ViT缺乏归纳偏置且依赖大数据训练。

Result: 模型在分类准确率上显著优于基线模型，有效结合了CNN和ViT的优势。

Conclusion: 该模型为CNN和ViT之间的差距提供了高效解决方案，组件可插拔适配多种应用。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of transformers in medical applications, the
exploration of multi-scale learning through transformers remains limited, while
hierarchical representations are considered advantageous for computer-aided
medical diagnosis. We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that
adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision
Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on
extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to
generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted
for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process,
preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a
scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and
inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by
enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we
refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly
outperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating
its efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The components are designed as plug-and-play
for different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications.

Result: 当前模型在VAD任务中表现有限，TRLC框架将检测精度提升了11.62%。

Conclusion: SmartHome-Bench和TRLC为智能家居VAD提供了有效工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security
by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD
benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios,
neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge
this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the
capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed
benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized
according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as
Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously
annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further
investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art
closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results
reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video
anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that
achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏基于Transformer的实时多人姿态估计模型，该任务在计算机视觉和虚拟现实中应用广泛。

Method: 采用改进的解码器架构和关键点相似性度量，生成正负查询以提升查询质量。

Result: 模型训练速度快（5-10倍少轮次），推理时间有竞争力，且无需量化库加速；性能优于或接近现有模型，参数更少。

Conclusion: 该模型在实时多人姿态估计任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) estimates keypoints for all individuals
present in an image. MPPE is a fundamental task for several applications in
computer vision and virtual reality. Unfortunately, there are currently no
transformer-based models that can perform MPPE in real time. The paper presents
a family of transformer-based models capable of performing multi-person 2D pose
estimation in real-time. Our approach utilizes a modified decoder architecture
and keypoint similarity metrics to generate both positive and negative queries,
thereby enhancing the quality of the selected queries within the architecture.
Compared to state-of-the-art models, our proposed models train much faster,
using 5 to 10 times fewer epochs, with competitive inference times without
requiring quantization libraries to speed up the model. Furthermore, our
proposed models provide competitive results or outperform alternative models,
often using significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: WildCAT3D是一个从多样化2D场景图像数据中学习生成新视角的框架，解决了场景级新视角合成（NVS）中缺乏干净多视图训练数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景级NVS缺乏多样化的干净多视图训练数据，而野外数据虽然丰富但存在外观变化问题。WildCAT3D旨在利用这些数据生成一致的新视角。

Method: 通过显式建模图像中的全局外观条件，扩展了多视图扩散范式，学习具有不同外观的场景视图。

Result: WildCAT3D在单视图NVS中实现了最先进的结果，并在生成过程中提供了全局外观控制。

Conclusion: WildCAT3D不仅减少了训练数据需求，还支持新应用，如生成时的外观控制。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) applied to
object-centric scenes, scene-level NVS remains a challenge. A central issue is
the lack of available clean multi-view training data, beyond manually curated
datasets with limited diversity, camera variation, or licensing issues. On the
other hand, an abundance of diverse and permissively-licensed data exists in
the wild, consisting of scenes with varying appearances (illuminations,
transient occlusions, etc.) from sources such as tourist photos. To this end,
we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned
from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on
these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in
images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn
from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new
scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel
views. WildCAT3D provides state-of-the-art results on single-view NVS in
object- and scene-level settings, while training on strictly less data sources
than prior methods. Additionally, it enables novel applications by providing
global appearance control during generation.

Conclusion: HKD4VLM通过知识蒸馏显著提升了模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Driven by the rapid progress in vision-language models (VLMs), the
responsible behavior of large-scale multimodal models has become a prominent
research area, particularly focusing on hallucination detection and factuality
checking. In this paper, we present the solution for the two tracks of
Responsible AI challenge. Inspirations from the general domain demonstrate that
a smaller distilled VLM can often outperform a larger VLM that is directly
tuned on downstream tasks, while achieving higher efficiency. We thus jointly
tackle two tasks from the perspective of knowledge distillation and propose a
progressive hybrid knowledge distillation framework termed HKD4VLM.
Specifically, the overall framework can be decomposed into Pyramid-like
Progressive Online Distillation and Ternary-Coupled Refinement Distillation,
hierarchically moving from coarse-grained knowledge alignment to fine-grained
refinement. Besides, we further introduce the mapping shift-enhanced inference
and diverse augmentation strategies to enhance model performance and
robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
HKD4VLM. Ablation studies provide insights into the critical design choices

Result: 实验表明，文本描述提高了准确性，尤其是在复杂或模糊情况下。

Conclusion: 该研究为计算机视觉与自然语言处理的结合提供了统一视角，并指出了未来方向，如更好的提示设计、跨模态迁移学习和实际适应性。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) has evolved from handcrafted feature-based
methods to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to models incorporating
large language models (LLMs). Early methods struggled with variations in
lighting, pose, and viewpoint, but deep learning addressed these issues by
learning robust visual features. Building on this, LLMs now enable ReID systems
to integrate semantic and contextual information through natural language. This
survey traces that full evolution and offers one of the first comprehensive
reviews of ReID approaches that leverage LLMs, where textual descriptions are
used as privileged information to improve visual matching. A key contribution
is the use of dynamic, identity-specific prompts generated by GPT-4o, which
enhance the alignment between images and text in vision-language ReID systems.
Experimental results show that these descriptions improve accuracy, especially
in complex or ambiguous cases. To support further research, we release a large
set of GPT-4o-generated descriptions for standard ReID datasets. By bridging
computer vision and natural language processing, this survey offers a unified
perspective on the field's development and outlines key future directions such
as better prompt design, cross-modal transfer learning, and real-world
adaptability.

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately
recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction
sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.
Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,
manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and
time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these
limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse
keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,
we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on
segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even
under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable
queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex
person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.
To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset
combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand
motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic
sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X
ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system
capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach
offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based
motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we
address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and
markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from
real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,
training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片诊断中常见的感知错误（如遗漏可见异常）缺乏有效的AI支持，RADAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RADAR通过分析放射科医生的标注和图像，检测潜在遗漏的异常区域，并提供区域建议而非固定标签。

Result: 在模拟数据集中，RADAR的召回率为0.78，精确度为0.44，F1分数为0.56，区域定位准确（IoU中位数0.78）。

Conclusion: RADAR能有效辅助放射科医生，减少AI依赖，适合实际工作流程，且开源实现便于进一步评估。

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual
errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and
clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited
support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack
meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI
Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.
RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs
regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal
regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested
regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate
inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error
dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection
over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision
of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the
simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this
reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI
collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals
exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively
complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for
perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions
and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world
radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we

*Can Polat,Hasan Kurban,Erchin Serpedin,Mustafa Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度多晶体数据集和两种物理评估协议，用于测试多模态生成模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基础模型在晶体学推理中的表现需要能够隔离泛化行为并强制物理约束的基准。

Method: 设计了Spatial-Exclusion和Compositional-Exclusion两种评估协议，测试模型在空间和化学组成上的泛化能力。

Result: 通过三种指标评估了九种视觉-语言基础模型的表现，建立了可重复的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该基准为大规模多模态模型的泛化性、一致性和可靠性提供了物理指导的评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires
benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical
constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two
physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative
models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given
radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial
interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits
all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across
stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with
crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations.
Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and
density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and
(iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid
space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically
informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability
in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at

### [91] [DualFast: Dual-Speedup Framework for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13058)
*Hu Yu,Hao Luo,Fan Wang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DualFast的统一且无需训练的加速框架，通过同时考虑离散化误差和近似误差来提升DPM采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型（DPMs）在视觉生成方面取得了显著成功，但其迭代采样导致推理速度较慢。减少采样步骤会引入离散化误差，现有快速采样器通过高阶求解器减少误差，但优化空间有限。

Method: 论文重新审视采样误差的本质，将其分为离散化误差和近似误差，并提出双误差解耦策略。基于此，设计了DualFast框架，兼容现有采样器，提升采样质量和速度。

Result: 实验证明DualFast在极少数采样步骤下显著提升采样质量和速度，适用于无条件/条件采样以及像素空间/潜在空间DPMs。

Conclusion: DualFast通过同时处理两种误差类型，有效加速DPM采样，为现有采样器提供了兼容且高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in
visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution,
but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make
inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of
high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization.
This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In
this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they
comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and
the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics
between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement
strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and
training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed
of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby
minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with
existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed,
particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness
of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional
and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space
DPMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM2是一种通过临床对话训练的多模态幻灯片级基础模型，旨在提升病理AI的通用性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的病理基础模型缺乏对全幻灯片图像（WSI）的理解，且未在大规模诊断数据上训练，限制了其在多样化下游任务中的表现。

Method: PRISM2通过两阶段训练：第一阶段使用对比和描述目标训练视觉语言模型，将全幻灯片嵌入与文本临床诊断对齐；第二阶段解冻语言模型以支持诊断对话，并从隐藏状态中提取更具临床意义的表示。

Result: PRISM2在诊断和生物标志物预测任务中表现优异，超越了PRISM和TITAN等先前的幻灯片级模型，并引入了无需提示调整或类别枚举的零样本分类方法。

Conclusion: PRISM2通过将视觉特征与临床推理对齐，提升了在数据丰富和低样本任务中的泛化能力，为构建通用病理AI代理提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level
representations but fall short of delivering general-purpose clinical utility
without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide
image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data,
limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a
multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to
enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly
700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic
reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained
using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings
with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to
enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful
representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on
diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level
models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no
classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning
or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning,
PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering
a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of
assisting diagnostic and prognostic decisions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMAN提出了一种新的视频个体计数方法，通过一对多匹配策略解决了现有方法对行人外观变化或漏检敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频个体计数方法采用一对一匹配策略，对行人外观变化或漏检敏感，限制了性能。

Method: OMAN采用一对多匹配策略，结合隐式上下文生成器和一对多配对匹配器，更好地适应行人社交行为。

Result: 在SenseCrowd和CroHD基准测试中，OMAN达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: OMAN通过一对多匹配策略显著提升了视频个体计数的性能，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task that aims to
estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends conventional Video Crowd
Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that
only learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key
problem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which
turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,
mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian
must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance
variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching
could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the
problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking
pedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with
implicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a
one-to-many pairwise matcher. Experiments on the SenseCrowd and CroHD
benchmarks show that OMAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is

*Bingxi Liu,Pengju Zhang,Li He,Hao Chen,Shiyi Guo,Yihong Wu,Jinqiang Cui,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperPlace通过结合经典特征聚合方法（如GeM和NetVLAD）和新的监督标签对齐方法，提出了G²M和NVL-FT²策略，显著提升了视觉地点识别（VPR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法未能充分利用基础模型（FM）的关键概念和经典聚合方法的潜力，因此需要更高效的训练和特征聚合策略。

Method: 1. 监督标签对齐方法统一训练框架；2. G²M利用双GeM进行紧凑特征聚合；3. NVL-FT²通过二次微调优化NetVLAD。

Result: G²M在特征维度仅为现有方法十分之一时表现优异；NVL-FT²在MSLS排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: SuperPlace通过结合经典方法与创新策略，显著提升了VPR性能，证明了经典方法的潜力。

Abstract: Recent visual place recognition (VPR) approaches have leveraged foundation
models (FM) and introduced novel aggregation techniques. However, these methods
have failed to fully exploit key concepts of FM, such as the effective
utilization of extensive training sets, and they have overlooked the potential
of classical aggregation methods, such as GeM and NetVLAD. Building on these
insights, we revive classical feature aggregation methods and develop more
fundamental VPR models, collectively termed SuperPlace. First, we introduce a
supervised label alignment method that enables training across various VPR
datasets within a unified framework. Second, we propose G$^2$M, a compact
feature aggregation method utilizing two GeMs, where one GeM learns the
principal components of feature maps along the channel dimension and calibrates
the output of the other. Third, we propose the secondary fine-tuning (FT$^2$)
strategy for NetVLAD-Linear (NVL). NetVLAD first learns feature vectors in a
high-dimensional space and then compresses them into a lower-dimensional space
via a single linear layer. Extensive experiments highlight our contributions
and demonstrate the superiority of SuperPlace. Specifically, G$^2$M achieves
promising results with only one-tenth of the feature dimensions compared to
recent methods. Moreover, NVL-FT$^2$ ranks first on the MSLS leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperPoint-SLAM3通过替换ORB为SuperPoint检测器-描述符、使用自适应非极大值抑制（ANMS）和集成NetVLAD位置识别模块，显著提升了ORB-SLAM3在极端视角、尺度和光照变化下的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORB-SLAM3在极端视角、尺度和光照变化下表现不佳，因为它依赖于手工设计的ORB关键点。

Method: 1. 用自监督的SuperPoint检测器-描述符替换ORB；2. 通过ANMS实现空间均匀的关键点分布；3. 集成轻量级NetVLAD位置识别模块用于学习型闭环检测。

Result: 在KITTI Odometry基准测试中，平均平移误差从4.15%降至0.34%，平均旋转误差从0.0027度/米降至0.0010度/米；在EuRoC MAV数据集中，误差大约减半。

Conclusion: 融合现代深度特征与学习型闭环模块显著提高了ORB-SLAM3的准确性，同时保持了其实时性。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) must remain accurate
under extreme viewpoint, scale and illumination variations. The widely adopted
ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB
keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces
ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces
spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and
(iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for
learning-based loop closure.
  On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational
error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010
deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every
sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern
deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3
accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.

*Yu Wang,Shiwei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEC-VAD提出了一种双结构方法，通过学习事件完整性来改进弱监督视频异常检测，显著提升了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测方法因缺乏密集帧级标注而导致事件定位不完整，需要一种更有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: LEC-VAD采用双结构设计，结合类别感知和类别无关语义，利用异常感知高斯混合模型学习事件边界，并通过记忆库原型学习机制增强文本描述。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime两个基准数据集上，LEC-VAD显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LEC-VAD通过学习事件完整性和增强文本表达，有效提升了弱监督视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing
temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos,
utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises
due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to
incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we
present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised
Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode
both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and
language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an
anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby
yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory
bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions
associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's
expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates
remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

TL;DR: Pro-AD通过扩展原型集和动态双向解码器解决原型重建方法在无监督异常检测中的不足，并通过原型约束提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型重建方法因原型数量有限导致正常信息聚合不足，且增加原型数量可能引发异常被过度重建的问题。

Method: 引入扩展原型集和动态双向解码器，结合原型约束机制，优化信息聚合和特征重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，展示了在多类无监督异常检测任务中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: Pro-AD通过综合原型信息和动态重建机制，显著提升了无监督异常检测的效果。

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

Motivation: 高反射物体的3D建模因强视角依赖外观而困难，现有方法或耗时平滑或几何约束不足。

Method: 基于2D高斯泼溅，结合基础模型的几何信息，提出GS-2DGS方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，重建和重光照效果显著优于高斯技术，速度比SDF方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: GS-2DGS成功填补了高斯泼溅与SDF方法间的空白，实现了高效高质的反射物体建模。

Abstract: 3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong
view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover
high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce
over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the
advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting
surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric
constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel
reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering
capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from
foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques
in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable
to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster. Code is

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型常产生幻觉输出，需细粒度检测以全面评估。

Method: 提出ZINA方法，细粒度识别幻觉并分类为六类错误，提供修正建议。

Result: ZINA在检测和编辑任务中优于GPT-4o和LLama-3.2。

Conclusion: ZINA能有效解决多模态模型的幻觉问题，提升输出质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where
the output deviates from the visual content. Given that these hallucinations
can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is
essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a
novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for
MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated
spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six
categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models
for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs
from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic
samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among
error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including
GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Features（MoF）的简单重排序方法，通过多度量损失函数优化全局特征，提升了VPR任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法依赖局部特征或运动序列，设计局部特征不切实际且运动序列有限制，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出MoF方法，在具体约束下优化全局特征，利用多度量损失函数计算权重。

Result: 在公开数据集上性能提升，如Pitts-30k测试集上比DINOv2基线提升0.9%，仅增加25KB参数和10微秒/帧处理时间。

Conclusion: MoF方法在低计算开销下显著提升VPR性能，具有实用性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a scene-oriented image retrieval problem in
computer vision in which re-ranking based on local features is commonly
employed to improve performance. In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop
Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a
sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is
impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by
these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines
global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied
constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied
constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which
include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and
self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF
weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function.
Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead.
For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of
10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a
DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，STAGE生成了600帧高质量视频，远超现有方法。

Conclusion: STAGE在长时驾驶视频生成中表现出色，具备生成无限长度视频的潜力。

Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over
extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world
modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature
misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and
limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these
limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine),
a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature
coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To
achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce
Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training
strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout
the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process
separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage
training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model
decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby
accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on
the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing
methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also
explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We
generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset,
which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

Conclusion: StgcDiff通过建模手语的时空特征，有效生成了平滑且语义准确的过渡视频。

Abstract: Sign language transition generation seeks to convert discrete sign language
segments into continuous sign videos by synthesizing smooth transitions.
However,most existing methods merely concatenate isolated signs, resulting in
poor visual coherence and semantic accuracy in the generated videos. Unlike
textual languages,sign language is inherently rich in spatial-temporal cues,
making it more complex to model. To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a
graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions
between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of
sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to
learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences.
Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations
learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition
frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key
component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal
features. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100,and
USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency
remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices
due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently,
training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost
solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high
cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas
visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically
important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we
introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning
algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity.
We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem
and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational
efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while
significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MT-PCR在准确性和效率上均优于基于Transformer的方法，显著降低了GPU内存使用和FLOPs。

Conclusion: MT-PCR通过结合Mamba和Transformer，有效解决了点云注册中的计算复杂度和无序性问题，实现了高效且准确的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision
and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers,
which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts
the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to
information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state
space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining
strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying
Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and
irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose
MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba
and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using
Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to
better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the
order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to
improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed
by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR
outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and
FLOPs.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D

flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Conclusion: DVP-MVS++ 通过多策略协同解决了变形不稳定性和遮挡问题，显著提升了多视角立体匹配的效果。

Abstract: Recently, patch deformation-based methods have demonstrated significant
effectiveness in multi-view stereo due to their incorporation of deformable and
expandable perception for reconstructing textureless areas. However, these
methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate
matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation
instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause
potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,
an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and
harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.
Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and
Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,
respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to
produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch
deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility
maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an
area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and
effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors
for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry
consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and
projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for
highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware
perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and
refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha
datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization
capability of our proposed method.

Result: 实验表明SASep在3D开放集识别中表现优异。

Conclusion: SASep通过增强几何和特征表示，有效区分已知和未知类别。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced 3D object
recognition, but most models are limited to closed-set scenarios, unable to
handle unknown samples in real-world applications. Open-set recognition (OSR)
addresses this limitation by enabling models to both classify known classes and
identify novel classes. However, current OSR methods rely on global features to
differentiate known and unknown classes, treating the entire object uniformly
and overlooking the varying semantic importance of its different parts. To
address this gap, we propose Salience-Aware Structured Separation (SASep),
which includes (i) a tunable semantic decomposition (TSD) module to
semantically decompose objects into important and unimportant parts, (ii) a
geometric synthesis strategy (GSS) to generate pseudo-unknown objects by
combining these unimportant parts, and (iii) a synth-aided margin separation
(SMS) module to enhance feature-level separation by expanding the feature
distributions between classes. Together, these components improve both
geometric and feature representations, enhancing the model's ability to
effectively distinguish known and unknown classes. Experimental results show
that SASep achieves superior performance in 3D OSR, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Facial texture generation is crucial for high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction
from a single image. However, existing methods struggle to generate UV albedo
maps with high-frequency details. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
end-to-end coarse-to-fine approach for UV albedo map generation. Our method
first utilizes a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM), driven by low-dimensional
coefficients, to generate coarse albedo maps with skin tones and low-frequency
texture details. To capture high-frequency details, we train a detail generator
using a decoupled albedo map dataset, producing high-resolution albedo maps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity
textures from a single image, outperforming existing methods in terms of
texture quality and realism. The code and pre-trained model are publicly
available at https://github.com/MVIC-DAI/UVAPM, facilitating reproducibility

Motivation: 现有方法难以区分自车运动与场景演变，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: COME结合场景中心预测与控制网络，生成与自车无关的未来特征，并注入占用世界模型。

Result: 在nuScenes-Occ3D数据集上，COME比SOTA方法（如DOME和UniScene）在mIoU指标上分别提升26.3%和23.7%。

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习能有效增强世界模型的时空预测保真度。

Abstract: World models are critical for autonomous driving to simulate environmental
dynamics and generate synthetic data. Existing methods struggle to disentangle
ego-vehicle motion (perspective shifts) from scene evolvement (agent
interactions), leading to suboptimal predictions. Instead, we propose to
separate environmental changes from ego-motion by leveraging the scene-centric
coordinate systems. In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that
integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl.
Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future
features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted
into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are
subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate
and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the
nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant
improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse
configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based,
fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under
the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7%
better mIoU metric than UniScene. These results highlight the efficacy of
disentangled representation learning in enhancing spatio-temporal prediction
fidelity for world models. Code and videos will be available at

Result: 在KITTI-360和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，ULOPS在开放集性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ULOPS通过不确定性建模和损失函数设计，有效解决了开放环境中的未知物体检测问题。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter
previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic
segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown
object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided
open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based
evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture
incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty
estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center
prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and
segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate
between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss
functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown
regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference
in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale.
Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level.
To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and
introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR
panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: Recycling steel scrap can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the
steel industry. However, a significant challenge in steel scrap recycling is
the inclusion of impurities other than steel. To address this issue, we propose
vision-language-model-based anomaly detection where a model is finetuned in a
supervised manner, enabling it to handle niche objects effectively. This model
enables automated detection of anomalies at a fine-grained level within steel
scrap. Specifically, we finetune the image encoder, equipped with multi-scale
mechanism and text prompts aligned with both normal and anomaly images. The
finetuning process trains these modules using a multiclass classification as
the supervision.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for
surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods
struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under
broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work
aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT
registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed
registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest
point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone
contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on
matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone
substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in
a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only
two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute
a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image
poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method
is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The
method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm
compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.
Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully
automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient
solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which
can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration
accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative
navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in
computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

Method: 提出Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA)，通过随机采样目标属性并调整交叉注意力层来实现公平分布。

Result: EFA在减少偏见的同时，保持了非目标属性和模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: EFA是一种有效的偏见缓解方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have
enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text
descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender,
race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and
shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation
methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement,
where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes)
unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target
attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this
challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that
accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and
Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details)
during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target
attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected
layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of
target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms
existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes,
thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the
original model.

Result: 性能优于现有方法，速度更快，编辑效果语义一致且高质量。

Conclusion: AttentionDrag为点编辑任务提供了高效且语义一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent
optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in
their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the
image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image
editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we
propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag,
which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables
semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for
extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent
correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net
module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust
relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency.
Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing
process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly
interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most
state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more
efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing
tasks.

Motivation: 尽管预训练的潜在扩散模型在自然图像上表现出色，但它们并未针对SAR数据的物理特性、统计分布和视觉特征进行优化，因此需要研究如何将其适应于这一新领域。

Method: 使用大规模SAR数据集（10万至100万张图像），比较了多种微调策略，包括全模型微调和参数高效方法（如LoRA），并分别针对UNet扩散主干和文本编码器组件进行了优化。

Result: 混合微调策略表现最佳：UNet的全微调能更好地捕捉SAR特有的低层模式，而文本编码器的部分微调（结合LoRA和<SAR>标记的嵌入学习）则保持了提示对齐。

Conclusion: 本研究为将基础模型适应于自然图像领域之外的非传统成像模态提供了系统化的策略。

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion
models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While
these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate
impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively
adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical
distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the
order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of
fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare
multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing
separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To
evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance
from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and
semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our
results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full
fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns,
while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding
learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work
provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional
imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

Conclusion: TA²Net在可听动作时间定位任务中表现出色，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to
identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike
conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization,
which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic
dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are
driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound
often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose
$TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the
second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on
audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization
strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis.
This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously
identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and
UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments
confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong
generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source
localization. Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action
recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are
predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit
the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework
that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using
task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition
performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module,
which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on
posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike
reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based
preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an
active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of
less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones.
Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher
weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches.

Abstract: Data visualization generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
promising results but often produces suboptimal visualizations that require
human intervention for improvement. In this work, we introduce VIS-Shepherd, a
specialized Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based critic to evaluate and
provide feedback for LLM-generated data visualizations. At the core of our
approach is a framework to construct a high-quality visualization critique
dataset, where we collect human-created visualization instances, synthesize
corresponding LLM-generated instances, and construct high-quality critiques. We
conduct both model-based automatic evaluation and human preference studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that even

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次结合双极化雷达植被指数（DpRVI）与光学指数分析葡萄园作物，揭示了DpRVI与光学指数的互补性及其在监测生物量动态中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 葡萄园因其明显的行向表现出独特的非各向同性散射行为，是遥感监测中具有挑战性和研究价值的目标。研究旨在探索DpRVI与光学指数的关系，以支持可持续葡萄园管理。

Method: 研究结合双极化雷达植被指数（DpRVI）与光学指数，分析葡萄园作物特征，并探讨其与生物量动态的关系。

Result: DpRVI在生长季节呈现抛物线趋势，与生物量动态相关，且与光学指数低相关性表明其捕捉了不同的葡萄园特征。初步结果显示DpRVI可用于区分葡萄园与其他作物。

Conclusion: DpRVI在监测葡萄园生物量动态和区分作物方面具有潜力，支持SAR技术在可持续农业中的应用，符合PNRR-NODES项目的气候适应和风险减少目标。

Abstract: Multi-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology has gained
increasing attention in agriculture, offering unique capabilities for
monitoring vegetation dynamics thanks to its all-weather, day-and-night
operation and high revisit frequency. This study presents, for the first time,
a comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index
(DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit
distinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row
orientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for
remote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between
DpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of
their information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide
complementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture
distinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over
the growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the
Winkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI
appears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific
phenological phases. Preliminary results also highlight the potential of DpRVI
for distinguishing vineyards from other crops. This research aligns with the
objectives of the PNRR-NODES project, which promotes nature-based solutions
(NbS) for sustainable vineyard management. The application of DpRVI for
monitoring vineyards is part of integrating remote sensing techniques into the
broader field of strategies for climate-related change adaptation and risk
reduction, emphasizing the role of innovative SAR-based monitoring in
sustainable agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习（SSL）的Masked Autoencoders（MAEs）方法，用于葡萄品种识别，解决了传统方法和小数据集深度学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统葡萄品种识别方法（如形态学和分子分析）存在主观性和高成本问题，而小数据集深度学习依赖迁移学习可能导致性能下降。自监督学习可以避免这些问题。

Method: 研究评估了MAEs在葡萄品种识别中的应用，使用了包含43个品种的基准数据集，并分析了预训练模型在不同季节的表现。

Result: ViT-B/16模型通过MAE预训练在未标记数据集上取得了0.7956的F1分数，优于其他模型。预训练时间长、简单数据增强更有效，掩码比例对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: MAEs在农业图像分类中表现优异，尤其适用于小数据集和低数据训练场景。

Abstract: Grapevine varieties are essential for the economies of many wine-producing
countries, influencing the production of wine, juice, and the consumption of
fruits and leaves. Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and
molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge
and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and
time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep
learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,
due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning
from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to
performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this
context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid
this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without
external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders
(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The
main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine
varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application
in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models
across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and
the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other
models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long
pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data
augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found
that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally.

Conclusion: 为高质量图像先验迁移到视频修复提供了有效范式，并解决了闪烁问题。

Abstract: Video face restoration faces a critical challenge in maintaining temporal
consistency while recovering fine facial details from degraded inputs. This
paper presents a novel approach that extends Vector-Quantized Variational
Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), pretrained on static high-quality portraits, into a
video restoration framework through variational latent space modeling. Our key
innovation lies in reformulating discrete codebook representations as
Dirichlet-distributed continuous variables, enabling probabilistic transitions
between facial features across frames. A spatio-temporal Transformer
architecture jointly models inter-frame dependencies and predicts latent
distributions, while a Laplacian-constrained reconstruction loss combined with
perceptual (LPIPS) regularization enhances both pixel accuracy and visual
quality. Comprehensive evaluations on blind face restoration, video inpainting,
and facial colorization tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This
work establishes an effective paradigm for adapting intensive image priors,
pretrained on high-quality images, to video restoration while addressing the
critical challenge of flicker artifacts. The source code has been open-sourced

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将相对深度转换为度量深度的通用框架TR2M，结合文本和图像输入，通过跨模态注意力模块和对比学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前单目深度估计中度量深度方法（MMDE）局限于特定领域，而相对深度方法（MRDE）泛化能力强但尺度不确定的问题。

Method: TR2M利用文本和图像输入，估计两个重缩放映射，通过跨模态注意力模块融合特征，并设计伪度量深度监督和尺度对比学习。

Result: TR2M在多个数据集上表现优异，并展示了强大的零样本能力。

Conclusion: 证明了结合语言辅助的像素级相对深度到度量深度转换的巨大潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a generalizable framework to transfer relative depth to
metric depth. Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided
into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs
estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain.
MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which
hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to
solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous
methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting
rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as
inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric
depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a
cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy
is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more
comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning
to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about
intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a
small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains
and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets
but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We
show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric
depth with language assistance. (Code is available at:

Result: 在多种逆问题中表现优异，尤其在压缩感知中，即使在极低采样率（5%）下也能高质量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为成像逆问题提供了高效灵活的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in imaging inverse problems
owing to their powerful generative capabilities. However, existing approaches
typically rely on models trained for specific degradation types, limiting their
generalizability to various degradation scenarios. To address this limitation,
we propose a zero-shot framework capable of handling various imaging inverse
problems without model retraining. We introduce a likelihood-guided noise
refinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood
score, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient
computations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the
model-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the
generative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve
inference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both
optimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and
flexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
inverse problems, particularly in compressive sensing, delivering high-quality
reconstructions even at an extremely low sampling rate (5%).

Conclusion: 展示了从图像中提取医学相关信号的潜力，并公开了代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of
accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method
that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate
remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust
uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies
systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can
be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on
an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two
new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly,
our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a
bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for
clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting
medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available
to facilitate further research.

Motivation: 事件相机在自动驾驶和机器人应用中具有高时间分辨率和动态范围优势，但稀疏事件数据处理计算密集，难以集成到资源受限的边缘应用中。

Method: 提出稀疏卷积循环学习，实现超过92%的激活稀疏度，降低时空推理成本。

Result: 在Prophesee数据集上验证，SEED在计算效率上设定了新标准，显著减少突触操作，同时保持或提高mAP。

Conclusion: SEED的硬件感知设计在实现高效能和低延迟神经形态处理中起关键作用。

Abstract: Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range, object detection
with event cameras can enhance the performance and safety of automotive and
robotics applications in real-world scenarios. However, processing sparse event
data requires compute-intensive convolutional recurrent units, complicating
their integration into resource-constrained edge applications. Here, we propose
the Sparse Event-based Efficient Detector (SEED) for efficient event-based
object detection on neuromorphic processors. We introduce sparse convolutional
recurrent learning, which achieves over 92% activation sparsity in recurrent
processing, vastly reducing the cost for spatiotemporal reasoning on sparse
event data. We validated our method on Prophesee's 1 Mpx and Gen1 event-based
object detection datasets. Notably, SEED sets a new benchmark in computational
efficiency for event-based object detection which requires long-term temporal
learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SEED significantly reduces
synaptic operations while delivering higher or same-level mAP. Our hardware
simulations showcase the critical role of SEED's hardware-aware design in
achieving energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic processing.

Method: 基于自监督深度估计框架，引入低分辨率深度输入、设计深度一致性损失和尺度恢复模块，并升级为SelfToF*以应对ToF数据稀疏性。

Result: 在NYU和ScanNet数据集上验证了高效性和有效性，SelfToF*在不同稀疏性下表现稳健。

Conclusion: SelfToF和SelfToF*为深度图增强提供了高效且自监督的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map enhancement using paired high-resolution RGB images offers a
cost-effective solution for improving low-resolution depth data from
lightweight ToF sensors. Nevertheless, naively adopting a depth estimation
pipeline to fuse the two modalities requires groundtruth depth maps for
supervision. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework,
SelfToF, which generates detailed and scale-aware depth maps. Starting from an
image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution
depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery
module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the
ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to
SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently,
SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF
data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified
by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code will be made
public.

Motivation: 在无约束的真实场景中，面部遮挡会降低年龄估计的准确性，现有方法对此效果有限。

Method: 使用SN-Patch GAN去除遮挡，结合ARCM和Swin Transformer增强特征表示，并引入MTAH进行多任务学习。

Result: 在FG-NET、UTKFace和MORPH数据集上，MAE分别达到3.00、4.54和2.53年。

Conclusion: 该方法在遮挡面部年龄估计任务中表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled
conditions. However, in unconstrained real-world scenarios, which are often
referred to as 'in the wild', age estimation remains challenging, especially
when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To
address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age
estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove
occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with
a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce
a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution
learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental
results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded
facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years,
respectively.

Method: 系统地将跟踪-检测方法分为五类：联合检测与嵌入、启发式、基于运动、亲和力学习和离线方法，并比较端到端跟踪方法。

Result: 启发式方法在密集数据集和线性运动场景中表现最佳，而深度学习关联方法在复杂运动模式中更优。

Conclusion: 不同方法适用于不同场景，启发式方法在简单场景中领先，深度学习关联方法在复杂场景中表现更佳。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves
detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of
deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the
tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach.
Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the
introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end
tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT
methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five
groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity
learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking
methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the
performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically
assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our
findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results
on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep
learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and
end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

Result: SA-LUT在LPIPS评分上比3D LUT方法降低了66.7%，并在视频风格化中保持16 FPS的实时性能。

Conclusion: SA-LUT在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，并提供了首个专门用于PST评估的基准PST50。

Abstract: Photorealistic style transfer (PST) enables real-world color grading by
adapting reference image colors while preserving content structure. Existing
methods mainly follow either approaches: generation-based methods that
prioritize stylistic fidelity at the cost of content integrity and efficiency,
or global color transformation methods such as LUT, which preserve structure
but lack local adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatial Adaptive 4D
Look-Up Table (SA-LUT), combining LUT efficiency with neural network
adaptability. SA-LUT features: (1) a Style-guided 4D LUT Generator that
extracts multi-scale features from the style image to predict a 4D LUT, and (2)
a Context Generator using content-style cross-attention to produce a context
map. This context map enables spatially-adaptive adjustments, allowing our 4D
LUT to apply precise color transformations while preserving structural
integrity. To establish a rigorous evaluation framework for photorealistic
style transfer, we introduce PST50, the first benchmark specifically designed
for PST assessment. Experiments demonstrate that SA-LUT substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 66.7% reduction in LPIPS
score compared to 3D LUT approaches, while maintaining real-time performance at

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics,
which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality.
However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant
challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to
potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided
super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided
super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The
framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep
Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure,
enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By
incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical
structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the
enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating realistic abundance
maps from hyperspectral imagery using an unsupervised, deep-learning-driven
approach. Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with
state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of
synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers
and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps
then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to
synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have
recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance,
flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional
spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable
unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of
hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging conditions--critical for
data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in
hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring
adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data.
We validate our approach using real hyperspectral imagery from the PRISMA space
mission for Earth observation, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing
realistic synthetic abundance maps that capture the spatial and spectral
characteristics of natural scenes.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer
graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven
mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,
Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually
requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to
work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to
automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering
from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and
accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent
geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions
to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint
functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally
by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our
GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements
and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be
self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual
plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school
level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and
accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we
obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the
current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification
property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for
more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利图像因其技术复杂性和语义信息丰富而难以检索，现有方法忽略了专利的层次关系。

Method: 引入层次多正对比损失，利用LIC分类系统为每张图像分配多个正样本对。

Result: 在DeepPatent2数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其适用于低参数模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升专利图像检索性能，且适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域优化的抗重叠框架（FOAM），通过频域和空间域特征提取提升重叠物体感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重叠物体感知在安全筛查和医疗辅助诊断中有重要应用价值，但现有方法多局限于空间域。

Method: 设计了频域空间变换块（FSTB）和分层去干扰机制（HDC），结合频域分析提升特征提取能力。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，FOAM显著提升了三种重叠物体感知任务的准确性。

Conclusion: FOAM通过频域优化有效提升了重叠物体感知性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Overlapping object perception aims to decouple the randomly overlapping
foreground-background features, extracting foreground features while
suppressing background features, which holds significant application value in
fields such as security screening and medical auxiliary diagnosis. Despite some
research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most
solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain
analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the
overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.
Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized
Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more
texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for
anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency
Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features
from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more
texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the
Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in
the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially
designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses
the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the
perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate
the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further
improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically
for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection,
Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection. The code will be open
source once the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人眼在注视时仍会以高达100Hz的频率进行微小随机运动，但世界中的稳定物体仍被感知为稳定，移动物体则被感知为移动。研究发现视觉稳定的心理物理学机制比相机图像稳定或进化视角的简单假设更为复杂。

Motivation: 探索人眼在微小运动下如何实现视觉稳定的心理物理学机制，揭示其复杂性。

Method: 通过十多年的系列实验，分析视网膜信号的处理机制。

Result: 实验揭示了视觉稳定的具体操作机制，并提出了功能性和电路级神经元的实现假设。

Conclusion: 视觉稳定机制比传统假设更复杂，涉及特定的视网膜信号处理，并可能由特定神经回路实现。

Abstract: Even during fixation the human eye is constantly in low amplitude motion,
jittering over small angles in random directions at up to 100Hz. This motion
results in all features of the image on the retina constantly traversing a
number of cones, yet objects which are stable in the world are perceived to be
stable, and any object which is moving in the world is perceived to be moving.
A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the
psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed,
say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be
assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The
psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of
operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior.
The presentation is in two levels. First is a functional description of the
action of the mechanism that is very likely responsible for the experimentally
observed behavior. Second is a more speculative proposal of circuit-level
neural elements that might implement the functional behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角几何正则化策略，结合MVS深度、RGB和法线约束，提升3D高斯泼溅的几何准确性和渲染质量。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在颜色变化大的场景中几何重建不准确，需改进。

Result: 实验证明方法在室内外场景中提升了几何准确性和渲染质量。

Conclusion: 方法有效结合MVS和高斯泼溅的优势，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: Recent methods, such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields,
have aimed to address the geometric inaccuracies of 3D Gaussian Splatting while
retaining its superior rendering quality. However, these approaches still
struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes
with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point
appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we
propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that
integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into
Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the
complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian
Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of
high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar
constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy
depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation.
To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative
depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth
information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided
Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal
positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully
combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering
quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱的医学图像检索评估方法，通过近似匹配计算医学概念间的相关性得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBIR评估指标依赖人工标注且忽略医学概念间的关系，医学文本中的概念可用于评估但需考虑其关联性。

Method: 利用知识图谱测量医学概念间距离，定义近似匹配的相关性得分来间接衡量医学图像相似性。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了所提相关性度量的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学CBIR评估提供了一种无需人工标注且考虑概念间关系的解决方案。

Abstract: Performance evaluation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains a
crucial but unsolved problem today especially in the medical domain. Various
evaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem.
Most of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from
classification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such
labels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains.
Furthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case
reports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text
contains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have
argued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for
CBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical
concepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle
relationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we
introduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various
medical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of
CBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets
of medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity
between medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and
feasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.

Conclusion: SMW-GS为复杂场景的3D重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from unconstrained image collections poses
significant challenges due to variations in appearance. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (SMW-GS), a novel
method that enhances 3D reconstruction across diverse scales by decomposing
scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. SMW-GS
incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables
Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and
Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using
frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances. To
achieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy,
which optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their
contributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality
reconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both
reconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale
urban environments with challenging illumination variations. Project is

TL;DR: Atomizer是一种灵活的架构，通过将遥感图像表示为标量集合，并利用上下文元数据，实现了对不同模态数据的统一处理，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖固定输入格式和特定模态编码器，难以适应多样化的遥感数据配置。

Method: Atomizer将图像表示为标量集合，每个标量对应像素的波段值，并添加元数据。采用结构化标记化和交叉注意力映射到潜在空间。

Result: 在模态分离评估中，Atomizer优于标准模型，并在不同分辨率和空间尺寸下表现稳健。

Conclusion: Atomizer提供了一种灵活且通用的方法，能够处理多样化的遥感数据配置。

Abstract: The growing number of Earth observation satellites has led to increasingly
diverse remote sensing data, with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal
configurations. Most existing models rely on fixed input formats and
modality-specific encoders, which require retraining when new configurations
are introduced, limiting their ability to generalize across modalities. We
introduce Atomizer, a flexible architecture that represents remote sensing
images as sets of scalars, each corresponding to a spectral band value of a
pixel. Each scalar is enriched with contextual metadata (acquisition time,
spatial resolution, wavelength, and bandwidth), producing an atomic
representation that allows a single encoder to process arbitrary modalities
without interpolation or resampling. Atomizer uses structured tokenization with
Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions to encode content and
context, and maps tokens into a latent space via cross-attention. Under
modality-disjoint evaluations, Atomizer outperforms standard models and
demonstrates robust performance across varying resolutions and spatial sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在放疗中广泛应用，但慢速旋转导致运动伪影和剂量增加，限制了其性能。

Method: 结合两个DDPM模型，通过投影和图像空间互补先验，完成缺失投影并优化体积重建。

Result: 在90度扫描下，MAE为35.5 HU，SSIM为0.84，PSNR为29.8 dB，伪影减少，软组织清晰度提高。

Conclusion: LA-GICD为有限角度CBCT重建提供了实用解决方案，提升了放疗中的图像质量和效率。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided
treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management.
However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion
artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically
feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive
limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or
dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated
cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic
cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing
projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.
This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and
image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90
degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.
Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78
planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.
The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of
29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.
LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic
forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast
reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and
dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong
data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for
short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing
clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate,
personalized treatments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅关注车道检测或车道间拓扑推理，忽略了车道与交通元素的关系或未能联合优化这些任务，而关系建模对感知和推理均有帮助。

Method: 提出关系感知的车道检测器、关系增强的拓扑头（包括几何增强的L2L头和跨视图L2T头），以及对比学习策略。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，DET$_l$提升3.1，TOP$_{ll}$提升5.3，TOP$_{lt}$提升4.9，OLS整体提升4.4，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 关系建模能有效联合提升感知与推理性能，为自动驾驶提供更准确的道路拓扑理解。

Abstract: Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task
are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically
focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often
\textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or
\textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches
either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the
inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational
modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally
leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their
connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both
perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding.
Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our
geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane
representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced
topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T
head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning
strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive
experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3
in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new
state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

Conclusion: X-Scene为自动驾驶提供了高质量、可控的大规模场景生成解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data
synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a
primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, the generation of
large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In
this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene
generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity,
while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports
multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or
text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic
guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient
customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a
unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the
corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.
Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene
through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy
and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial
continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted
into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as
scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene
significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving
scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous
driving.

Conclusion: 状态空间建模在视频数据压缩中具有优势，框架高效且适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We propose an efficient framework to compress multiple video-frame features
before feeding them into large multimodal models, thereby mitigating the severe
token explosion arising from long or dense videos. Our design leverages a
bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and
a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted
learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both
spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective
manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our
approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models,
while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our
proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in
substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space
modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework
emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world
deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple
benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and
comprehensive video understanding.

an integrated workflow, which integrates high-fidelity 3D reconstruction based
on monocular video, finite element simulation analysis, and mixed reality
visual display, aiming to build an interactive digital twin system for
industrial inspection, equipment maintenance and other scenes. Firstly, the
Neuralangelo algorithm based on deep learning is used to reconstruct the 3D
mesh model with rich details from the surround-shot video. Then, the QuadRemesh
tool of Rhino is used to optimize the initial triangular mesh and generate a
structured mesh suitable for finite element analysis. The optimized mesh is
further discretized by HyperMesh, and the material parameter setting and stress
simulation are carried out in Abaqus to obtain high-precision stress and
deformation results. Finally, combined with Unity and Vuforia engine, the
real-time superposition and interactive operation of simulation results in the
augmented reality environment are realized, which improves users 'intuitive
understanding of structural response. Experiments show that the method has good
simulation efficiency and visualization effect while maintaining high geometric
accuracy. It provides a practical solution for digital modeling, mechanical
analysis and interactive display in complex industrial scenes, and lays a
foundation for the deep integration of digital twin and mixed reality
technology in industrial applications.

Conclusion: AdaVideoRAG为视频分析中的自适应检索建立了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to
fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval
strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss
for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework
that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a
lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing
module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual
features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across
tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video
understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis. Codes will

Conclusion: Dive3D通过SIM损失和统一优化框架，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效果。

Abstract: Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven
remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods
typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves
asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking
behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a
novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with
Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively
mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion
distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence
perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly
more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and
overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and
find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments,
including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate
its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine
state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative
metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry
consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

*Chenlu Zhan,Gaoang Wang,Hongwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeQ-Graph提出了一种通过无预定义词汇的3D场景图实现自由形式语义查询的方法，解决了现有方法依赖训练数据和预定义词汇的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景理解方法依赖大规模训练数据和预定义词汇，限制了自由形式语义查询的能力。此外，基于LLM的方法缺乏全面的3D场景信息且可能生成不一致的输出。

Method: FreeQ-Graph通过构建完整的3D场景图（利用LLM和LVLM指导），将图节点与3D语义对齐特征结合，并设计基于LLM的推理算法，实现自由形式查询。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验表明，FreeQ-Graph在复杂自由形式语义查询和关系推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeQ-Graph通过无预定义词汇的3D场景图和语义对齐，显著提升了自由形式语义查询的能力和准确性。

Abstract: Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a
significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale
training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.
However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data
hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on
LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information
and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In
our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a
semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to
encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without
predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,
which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a
complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their
relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or
predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate
semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged
superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic
querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines
scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted
extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex
querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation.
Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form
semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

*Zhiyi Shi,Binjie Wang,Chongjie Si,Yichen Wu,Junsik Kim,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualEdit, a model editor for vision-language models, modifies both textual and visual modalities at key layers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model editing methods focus on single-modal language models, leaving the impact of multiple modalities in vision-language models unexplored.

Method: Proposes DualEdit, which edits both textual and visual modalities at their peak sensitivity layers and includes a gating module for efficient knowledge updates.

Result: DualEdit outperforms state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines and adapted LLM methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: DualEdit effectively updates knowledge in VLMs while preserving original capabilities, demonstrating the importance of multimodal editing.

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge
without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering
editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing
single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models
(VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality
on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find
that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at
different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both
modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of
compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we
propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at
their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within
the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update
new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate
DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating
its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted
LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超长自我中心视频的复杂推理问题，模仿人类问题解决策略，分解任务为模块化步骤。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），结合CoTT数据和新构建的数据集Ego-R1 Data。

Result: Ego-R1代理在Ego-R1 Bench基准测试中显著提升时间覆盖范围，从几小时扩展到一周。

Conclusion: 动态工具增强的链式思维推理能有效应对超长自我中心视频的独特挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e.,
in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured
Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained
via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies,
CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent
invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively
answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal
understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised
finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to
enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range
reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data,
which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our
Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark,
Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources.
Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought
reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of
understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time
coverage from few hours to a week.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为教育视频中的视觉内容检测提供高质量的数据集，支持监督和半监督方法的研究。

Method: 手动标注1000帧（LVVO_1k），并通过半监督方法自动标注3000帧（LVVO_3k）。

Result: 数据集标注质量高（F1分数83.41%），并公开可用。

Conclusion: LVVO数据集为教育视频中的视觉内容检测提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark
for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists
of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer
science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has
been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table,
Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was
labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1
score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus
annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement
through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised
approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames,
forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing
and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content
detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to
support further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出高质量开源UHD-4K文本到视频数据集UltraVideo，并扩展UltraWan模型，支持1K/4K视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集无法满足高质量视频生成需求，如电影级UHD视频和4K短视频内容。

Method: 设计四阶段自动化数据筛选流程：视频片段收集、统计过滤、模型净化、生成结构化字幕。

Result: UltraVideo数据集覆盖100多种主题，UltraWan模型能生成高质量1K/4K视频。

Conclusion: UltraVideo和UltraWan为UHD视频生成研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: The quality of the video dataset (image quality, resolution, and fine-grained
caption) greatly influences the performance of the video generation model. The
growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality
video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High
Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However,
the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications.
In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of
which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide
range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions
with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully
design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final
high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video
clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data
purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In
addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate
high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work
can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

TL;DR: Vid-CamEdit是一个用于视频相机轨迹编辑的新框架，通过用户定义的相机路径重新合成单目视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在极端轨迹变化和野外视频处理上表现不佳，且缺乏多视角视频训练数据。

Method: 分两步：估计时间一致的几何结构，并基于此进行生成式渲染。通过分解微调框架减少对4D训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在真实场景中，尤其在极端外推情况下，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合几何先验和生成式渲染，Vid-CamEdit能有效处理复杂轨迹编辑任务。

Abstract: We introduce Vid-CamEdit, a novel framework for video camera trajectory
editing, enabling the re-synthesis of monocular videos along user-defined
camera paths. This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the
limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods
struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for
dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach
consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and
generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors,
the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the
estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D
training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains
spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our
method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera
trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world
footage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界标注数据的缺乏，研究模拟数据在事件相机目标检测中的有效性。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟器的DVS模块生成合成数据，训练循环视觉变换器模型，并在合成和真实数据混合测试集上评估。

Result: 仅用合成数据训练的模型在合成数据为主的测试集表现良好，但在真实数据增加时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前DVS模拟器的保真度有限，需改进领域适应技术以提升事件相机在交通监控中的应用。

Abstract: Event cameras are gaining traction in traffic monitoring applications due to
their low latency, high temporal resolution, and energy efficiency, which makes
them well-suited for real-time object detection at traffic intersections.
However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by
the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this,
several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.
Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision
sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,
the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently
studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by
training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data
generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic
and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely
on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer
significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data
increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger
generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable
analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs
DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and
underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic
vision for traffic monitoring.

TL;DR: OTFusion是一个无需训练的框架，通过最优传输桥接视觉语言模型和纯视觉基础模型，提升零样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）过于依赖类别先验，而纯视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）缺乏语义对齐，两者互补性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出OTFusion框架，通过最优传输学习共享概率表示，对齐视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上平均准确率提升近10%，无需微调或额外标注。

Conclusion: OTFusion有效结合了两种模型的优势，显著提升了零样本学习性能。

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen categories by
leveraging both semantic class descriptions and the distribution of unlabeled
test data. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel at aligning
visual inputs with textual semantics, they often rely too heavily on
class-level priors and fail to capture fine-grained visual cues. In contrast,
Vision-only Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv2 provide rich perceptual
features but lack semantic alignment. To exploit the complementary strengths of
these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free
framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically,
OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual
and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their
respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class
predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTFusion
consistently outperforms the original CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy
improvement of nearly $10\%$, all without any fine-tuning or additional
annotations. The code will be publicly released after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法依赖成对预测，限制了全局几何一致性。

Method: 使用图像三元组生成重建，通过自监督目标优化网络。

Result: 在3D重建和多视角深度估计任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Test3R通用性强、成本低，易于应用到其他模型。

Abstract: Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D
reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited
generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency.
In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning
technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets
($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and
($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a
self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these
two reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model
produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth
estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free,
making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time
training overhead and parameter footprint. Code is available at

Conclusion: AutoVLA通过统一的模型和优化方法，显著提升了自动驾驶中的推理和规划性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise
for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning
capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically
infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long
reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies
reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model
for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and
trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.
We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling
direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised
fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking
(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).
To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive
experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including
nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of
AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results
showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA
in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: PF-LHM在无约束场景下高效生成高质量3D人体模型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing an animatable 3D human from casually captured images of an
articulated subject without camera or human pose information is a practical yet
challenging task due to view misalignment, occlusions, and the absence of
structural priors. While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity
results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose
estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in
unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient
single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input
images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that
generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually
captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder
Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point
features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused
features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented
using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human
reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without
requiring camera and human pose annotations. Code and models will be released
to the public.

Motivation: 研究高斯模糊对人脸匿名化的有效性，探索模糊图像是否可被恢复并用于重新识别。

Result: Revelio在高度模糊情况下表现优异，重新识别准确率达95.9%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 高斯模糊不适用于人脸匿名化，需探索更安全的替代方案。

Abstract: Gaussian blur is widely used to blur human faces in sensitive photos before
the photos are posted on the Internet. However, it is unclear to what extent
the blurred faces can be restored and used to re-identify the person,
especially under a high-blurring setting. In this paper, we explore this
question by developing a deblurring method called Revelio. The key intuition is
to leverage a generative model's memorization effect and approximate the
inverse function of Gaussian blur for face restoration. Compared with existing
methods, we design the deblurring process to be identity-preserving. It uses a
conditional Diffusion model for preliminary face restoration and then uses an
identity retrieval model to retrieve related images to further enhance
fidelity. We evaluate Revelio with large public face image datasets and show
that it can effectively restore blurred faces, especially under a high-blurring
setting. It has a re-identification accuracy of 95.9%, outperforming existing
solutions. The result suggests that Gaussian blur should not be used for face
anonymization purposes. We also demonstrate the robustness of this method
against mismatched Gaussian kernel sizes and functions, and test preliminary
countermeasures and adaptive attacks to inspire future work.

TL;DR: InverTune是一种针对多模态模型的后门防御框架，无需攻击者知识或中毒数据集，通过对抗模拟、梯度反演和聚类微调实现高效防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态对比学习模型（如CLIP）易受后门攻击，现有防御方法因假设过强或数据需求过高而不实用。

Method: InverTune通过对抗模拟暴露攻击特征，梯度反演重建潜在触发器，聚类微调消除后门功能。

Result: 实验显示InverTune将攻击成功率降低97.87%，仅损失3.07%的干净数据准确率。

Conclusion: InverTune为多模态系统安全提供了新范式，在不影响性能的情况下提升安全性。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
vision-language alignment capabilities, yet their vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses critical security risks. Attackers can implant latent triggers
that persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model
behavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense
mechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker
knowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce
InverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under
minimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack
targets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods
that rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune
effectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key
components, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,
InverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,
probabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response
patterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to
reconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a
clustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor
function with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the
original model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces
the average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.
This work establishes a new paradigm for securing multimodal systems, advancing
security in foundation model deployment without compromising performance.

*Stan Muñoz Gutiérrez,Franz Wotawa*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受生物启发的SFRFs技术，用于轴承故障诊断和剩余使用寿命（RUL）估计，通过频率域特征提取算法增强故障特征的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受视网膜神经节细胞感受野的启发，提出一种能够增强振动信号中故障特征检测的方法，以应对多变工况下的早期故障诊断。

Method: 设计了基于频率域的SFRFs滤波器，结合NSGA-II算法进行多目标优化，同时最小化RUL预测误差、最大化特征单调性并促进平滑退化轨迹。

Result: 在XJTU-SY轴承数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够检测早期故障及其前兆，并通过bagging回归器实现准确的RUL预测。

Conclusion: SFRFs结合了信号处理、生物感知原理和数据驱动的预测方法，具有可解释性和设计合理性，适用于旋转机械的健康监测。

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically
inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis
and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround
organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a
frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of
fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic
spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory
surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under
variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization
strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field
parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing
feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method
is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its
suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring
applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,
inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary
optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;
and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults
and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed
spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging
regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of
SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and
data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时架构，结合Unreal Engine 5和NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face，将语音情感转化为高保真面部表情，用于逼真的儿童虚拟形象。研究评估了情感表达的识别率和感知效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成的虚拟形象在动态情感表达上表现不足，限制了其在敏感场景（如儿童虐待调查培训）中的应用。

Method: 采用分布式双PC架构，分离语言处理和GPU渲染，支持低延迟交互。通过实验评估音频+视觉和仅视觉条件下的情感识别效果。

Result: 研究发现悲伤和快乐情感识别率高，但愤怒情感在无音频时识别率显著下降。去除音频反而提升了面部真实感感知。

Conclusion: 研究证实了情感表达虚拟形象的技术可行性，并提供了改进敏感培训模拟中非语言沟通的指导。

Abstract: Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars;
however, most systems remain visually inert, limiting their utility in
high-stakes simulations such as virtual training for investigative interviews
with abused children. We introduce and evaluate a real-time architecture fusing
Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to
translate vocal prosody into high-fidelity facial expressions on photorealistic
child avatars. We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples
language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed
to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A
between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions
assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial
realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger.
  Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with
sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition
significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent
vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted
perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key
design challenge. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of
generating emotionally expressive avatars and provide guidance for improving
non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件采样中的应用受到关注，但现有方法（如DPS）难以直接近似后验得分函数。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的后验得分表达式，并通过动态计算步长来最小化误差，适用于去噪和其他逆问题。

Result: 该方法在去噪、着色、随机修复和超分辨率等任务中表现优异，且采样效率高于DPS。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，能够以更少的时间步长实现与现有技术竞争的性能。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional
sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image
restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable
posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression
for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in
terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze
the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step
sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that
these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as
colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity,
this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables
sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

Result: BTC-LLM在保持高精度的同时提高了计算效率，无需稀疏掩码。

Conclusion: BTC-LLM为LLM压缩提供了高效且硬件兼容的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model
(LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and
computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods
achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer
from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational
complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In
this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework
that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to
overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency.
Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation
that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized
weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to
enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary
Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them
into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid
updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient
inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy,
has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have
been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more
complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached
a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a
neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the
newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A
metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a
modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective
mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural
network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning
strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into
another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,
our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and
the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved
outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including
ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner
that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various
domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data
can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct
implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of
interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients
recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of
multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS
location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely
collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately
for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each
modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware
prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster
labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these
clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected
alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical
significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large
language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the
proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This
unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables
clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve
health outcomes.

Motivation: 解决自注意力机制在大规模物理系统中计算复杂度高的问题，并适应不规则几何结构。

Conclusion: BSA是一种高效且适用于不规则几何数据的稀疏注意力机制。

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for
large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a
viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as
text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this
work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing
regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et
al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods,
yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure
prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while
significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法通常将蒸馏项作为交叉熵的附加项，需要精细调参。本文从选择理论角度重新思考蒸馏问题。

Method: 采用Plackett-Luce模型，将教师模型的logits视为“价值”分数，设计加权列表排序损失PLD，直接优化教师模型的最优排序。

Result: 在标准图像分类任务中，PLD在均匀和非均匀设置下分别比DIST和KD方法提升了0.42%~1.09%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: PLD通过直接优化教师模型的排序，提供了一种更高效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证方法假设验证过程是忠实的，但实际中可能因扰动而失效，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Result: 实验证明CertDW方法有效且能抵抗自适应攻击。

Conclusion: CertDW为数据集所有权验证提供了认证保障，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets
(e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV)
crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find
existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is
faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using
the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this
assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may
degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations.
To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark
(i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method
that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain
conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired
by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including
principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model
prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise
perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR,
enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value
significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on
watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a
threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the
protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive
attacks. Our codes are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩自适应方法不考虑数据上下文，导致微调性能不佳和预训练知识遗忘。

Method: 提出上下文导向奇异值分解（SVD），通过目标任务的输入激活协方差矩阵初始化适配器，并开发动态协方差选择和动态秩分配策略。

Result: CorDA++在KPM模式下优于LoRA，减少知识遗忘；IPM模式下收敛更快（如4.5倍于QLoRA），并在多种场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CorDA++通过任务感知和动态策略显著提升了自适应性能，已集成到Hugging Face的PEFT库中。

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering
data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe
forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose
context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that
initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop
context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance
matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the
target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its
corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is
compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our
method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)
and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between
freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or
adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by
deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal
components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank
allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each
layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank
allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a
significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning
performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained
knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,
our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,
and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong
baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library
developed by Hugging Face.

TL;DR: SeqPE是一种统一且完全可学习的位置编码框架，通过将位置索引表示为符号序列并利用轻量级编码器学习嵌入，解决了传统位置编码的适应性和扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法（如ALiBi和RoPE）在适应新模态时需大量修改，且固定大小的查找表限制了序列长度外推能力。SeqPE旨在提供一种更灵活、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: SeqPE将位置索引表示为符号序列，使用轻量级顺序编码器学习嵌入，并通过对比目标和知识蒸馏损失正则化嵌入空间。

Result: 在语言建模、长上下文问答和2D图像分类任务中，SeqPE在困惑度、精确匹配和准确率上优于基线，尤其在序列长度外推时表现突出。

Conclusion: SeqPE不仅提升了性能，还能无缝扩展到多维输入，无需手动调整架构，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by
design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial
understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable
position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained
sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this
limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,
underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this
work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding
framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic
sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their
embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we
introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns
embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a
knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position
embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing
extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context
question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only
surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and
accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables
seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual
architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at

Motivation: 离散扩散模型在文本生成中具有优势，但缺乏灵活填充文本长度和位置的能力。

Method: DDOT采用样本级最优传输耦合，动态调整填充段的位置和长度。

Result: 在One-Billion-Word和Yelp等基准测试中，DDOT优于基线模型，性能与非自回归模型相当。

Conclusion: DDOT在训练效率和灵活性上显著提升，为文本扩散模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer
advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and
flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical
limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform
flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to
ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete
\textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling),
the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly
denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level
Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token
ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled
segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is
orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with
various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling
benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms
naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with
state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements
in training efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: 提出的视频修复扩散模型为PDE求解提供了准确且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing
methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse
problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks
under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast
PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward
prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states
from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based
architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer
missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video
diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,
while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.
Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model
offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and
problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种估计扩散模型最优损失值的方法，用于诊断和改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的损失值无法直接反映数据拟合质量，因为其最优值通常未知，导致难以区分模型容量不足与最优损失较大的情况。

Method: 通过统一扩散模型的数学形式，推导出最优损失的闭式解，并开发了可扩展的随机估计器。

Result: 该方法能够诊断主流扩散模型的训练质量，并基于最优损失开发了更高效的训练计划。此外，研究发现减去最优损失后，训练损失更符合幂律分布。

Conclusion: 估计最优损失为扩散模型的诊断和改进提供了新工具，同时为研究扩散模型的缩放定律提供了更合理的设置。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of
absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero
but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient
model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss
value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the
optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,
and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant
scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this
tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of
mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training
schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B
parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting
the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled
setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了合成数据在医学影像分割任务中替代真实数据的可行性，发现合成MRI数据质量较高，但CT数据质量有限，且分割效果受任务复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据保护严格，匿名化困难，合成数据可能提供解决方案，但缺乏对其真实性和实用性的严格评估。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络和扩散模型生成合成数据，并通过MAE、MS-SSIM、Radiomics、视觉图灵测试（VTT）和DSC评估其质量和实用性。

Result: 合成MRI数据保真度高（相关系数0.8784），但CT数据质量较低（0.5461）。分割任务中，MRI肿瘤分割效果较好（DSC=0.834），CT肿瘤分割效果差（DSC=0.064）。

Conclusion: 合成数据可用于分割任务，但受限于结构复杂度。需改进生成模型以提升细节学习能力，增强真实性和应用潜力。

Abstract: AI requires extensive datasets, while medical data is subject to high data
protection. Anonymization is essential, but poses a challenge for some regions,
such as the head, as identifying structures overlap with regions of clinical
interest. Synthetic data offers a potential solution, but studies often lack
rigorous evaluation of realism and utility. Therefore, we investigate to what
extent synthetic data can replace real data in segmentation tasks. We employed
head and neck cancer CT scans and brain glioma MRI scans from two large
datasets. Synthetic data were generated using generative adversarial networks
and diffusion models. We evaluated the quality of the synthetic data using MAE,
MS-SSIM, Radiomics and a Visual Turing Test (VTT) performed by 5 radiologists
and their usefulness in segmentation tasks using DSC. Radiomics indicates high
fidelity of synthetic MRIs, but fall short in producing highly realistic CT
tissue, with correlation coefficient of 0.8784 and 0.5461 for MRI and CT
tumors, respectively. DSC results indicate limited utility of synthetic data:
tumor segmentation achieved DSC=0.064 on CT and 0.834 on MRI, while bone
segmentation a mean DSC=0.841. Relation between DSC and correlation is
observed, but is limited by the complexity of the task. VTT results show
synthetic CTs' utility, but with limited educational applications. Synthetic
data can be used independently for the segmentation task, although limited by
the complexity of the structures to segment. Advancing generative models to
better tolerate heterogeneous inputs and learn subtle details is essential for
enhancing their realism and expanding their application potential.

TL;DR: MRI-CORE是一个预训练的视觉基础模型，旨在解决MRI任务中标注数据稀缺的问题，通过大规模预训练提升小样本任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI任务中标注数据获取成本高且隐私问题严重，限制了深度学习模型的应用。

Method: 提出MRI-CORE模型，基于超过110,000个MRI体积的6百万切片进行预训练。

Result: 在5个分割任务中，仅用10个标注切片即可提升6.97%的3D Dice系数，并展示了零样本分割等新能力。

Conclusion: MRI-CORE作为通用MRI基础模型，有望降低数据标注门槛，推动更多应用。

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep
learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide
range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object
segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high
annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we
introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision
foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000
MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object
segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve
segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data
availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only
10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in
MRI such as classification of image properties including body location,
sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results
highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for
MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率在视频会议中具有重要意义，尤其是针对低分辨率视频编码（如H.265）的场景，需要提升视频的感知质量。

Method: 采用了局部、单向、双向传播或传统上采样后恢复等方法，并设计了三个赛道（通用视频、头部视频和屏幕内容视频）来评估不同场景下的VSR效果。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛为视频超分辨率领域提供了新的数据集和评估方法，推动了低延迟场景下VSR技术的发展。

Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on
reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The
field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in
single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal
domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-,
bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration.
This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with
H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor,
providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay
scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks:
general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with
separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and
testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this
challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a
crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

TL;DR: 提出Shapeaware Sampling (SAS)方法，通过优化采样策略和拓扑保留骨架表示，提升多类管状结构的建模精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法注重体积重叠精度，但忽略了细粒度语义管状结构的拓扑完整性。

Method: 引入FDPS量化形状复杂度，MPC-Skel生成拓扑一致骨架，优化采样策略和目标函数。

Result: 在两个数据集上，体积重叠和拓扑完整性指标均显著提升。

Conclusion: SAS方法高效且易于集成，显著改善了管状结构的建模效果。

Abstract: Accurate multi-class tubular modeling is critical for precise lesion
localization and optimal treatment planning. Deep learning methods enable
automated shape modeling by prioritizing volumetric overlap accuracy. However,
the inherent complexity of fine-grained semantic tubular shapes is not fully
emphasized by overlap accuracy, resulting in reduced topological preservation.
To address this, we propose the Shapeaware Sampling (SAS), which optimizes
patchsize allocation for online sampling and extracts a topology-preserved
skeletal representation for the objective function. Fractal Dimension-based
Patchsize (FDPS) is first introduced to quantify semantic tubular shape
complexity through axis-specific fractal dimension analysis. Axes with higher
fractal complexity are then sampled with smaller patchsizes to capture
fine-grained features and resolve structural intricacies. In addition, Minimum
Path-Cost Skeletonization (MPC-Skel) is employed to sample topologically
consistent skeletal representations of semantic tubular shapes for
skeleton-weighted objective functions. MPC-Skel reduces artifacts from
conventional skeletonization methods and directs the focus to critical
topological regions, enhancing tubular topology preservation. SAS is
computationally efficient and easily integrable into optimization pipelines.
Evaluation on two semantic tubular datasets showed consistent improvements in
both volumetric overlap and topological integrity metrics.

### [182] [Adaptive Multi-resolution Hash-Encoding Framework for INR-based Dental CBCT Reconstruction with Truncated FOV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12471)
*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）和哈希编码的高效3D牙科CBCT重建框架，通过扩展重建域和自适应训练策略减少截断伪影，同时显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用INR技术到具有截断视野（FOV）的3D牙科CBCT重建时，测量投影与截断域内的前向投影不匹配，导致重建图像出现严重伪影。

Method: 采用多分辨率哈希编码和自适应训练策略，在扩展的重建域内训练网络，内部使用高分辨率采样，外部使用低分辨率采样，并通过自适应哈希编码器保持输入维度一致。

Result: 扩展FOV有效减少了截断伪影，自适应策略在800x800x600图像体积下减少60%以上的计算时间，同时保持PSNR。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算效率和重建质量上均优于固定分辨率扩展域的方法，适用于3D牙科CBCT重建。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR), particularly in combination with hash
encoding, has recently emerged as a promising approach for computed tomography
(CT) image reconstruction. However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D
dental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.
During the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's
head, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward
projections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the
network to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts
in the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally
efficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution
hash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation
artifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that
fully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an
adaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution
levels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution
levels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input
dimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we
introduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level
features of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The
proposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation
artifacts. Compared with a naive domain extension using fixed resolution levels
and a fixed sampling rate, the adaptive strategy reduces computational time by
over 60% for an image volume of 800x800x600, while preserving the PSNR within
the truncated FOV.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的轻量级单图像超分辨率（SISR）方法，通过Star Distillation Module（SDM）和Multi-shape Multi-scale Large Kernel Attention（MM-LKA）模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级SISR方法在映射高维非线性特征空间和捕捉多形状多尺度信息方面存在不足，计算负担也较大。

Method: 提出SDM增强特征表示学习，MM-LKA模块高效捕捉长程依赖，结合两者构建RSDAM模块，最终形成SDAN网络。

Result: 实验表明，SDAN在低模型复杂度下，定量和视觉上均优于其他轻量级SISR方法。

Conclusion: SDAN通过高效的特征学习和注意力机制，显著提升了轻量级SISR的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the performance of lightweight Single-Image Super-Resolution
(SISR) has been improved significantly with the application of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Large Kernel Attention (LKA). However, existing
information distillation modules for lightweight SISR struggle to map inputs
into High-Dimensional Non-Linear (HDNL) feature spaces, limiting their
representation learning. And their LKA modules possess restricted ability to
capture the multi-shape multi-scale information for long-range dependencies
while encountering a quadratic increase in the computational burden with
increasing convolutional kernel size of its depth-wise convolutional layer. To
address these issues, we firstly propose a Star Distillation Module (SDM) to
enhance the discriminative representation learning via information distillation
in the HDNL feature spaces. Besides, we present a Multi-shape Multi-scale Large
Kernel Attention (MM-LKA) module to learn representative long-range
dependencies while incurring low computational and memory footprints, leading
to improving the performance of CNN-based self-attention significantly.
Integrating SDM and MM-LKA, we develop a Residual Star Distillation Attention
Module (RSDAM) and take it as the building block of the proposed efficient Star
Distillation Attention Network (SDAN) which possesses high reconstruction
efficiency to recover a higher-quality image from the corresponding
low-resolution (LR) counterpart. When compared with other lightweight
state-of-the-art SISR methods, extensive experiments show that our SDAN with
low model complexity yields superior performance quantitatively and visually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ZS-NCD是一种基于神经压缩的零样本去噪框架，无需训练样本或干净参考图像，适用于医学成像等专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本去噪问题，特别是在专业成像领域（如医学或生物学）中缺乏训练数据的情况。

Method: 利用神经压缩网络作为未经训练的模型，直接在单个噪声图像的补丁上进行优化，并通过聚合重叠补丁的输出获得最终重建。

Result: ZS-NCD在零样本去噪中实现了最先进的性能，适用于高斯和泊松噪声，并能泛化到自然和非自然图像。

Conclusion: ZS-NCD通过内置的熵约束避免了过拟合，无需手动正则化或提前停止，同时提供了压缩去噪的理论基础。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training
samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in
practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical
imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression
Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression.
ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized
directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final
reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model
over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of
compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not
require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments,
we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot
denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both
natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample
theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable
reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers.
These results further establish the theoretical foundations of
compression-based denoising. Our code is available at:

that leverages the latent diffusion model (LDM) to enhance the efficiency and
precision of MRI generation tasks. GM-LDM integrates a 3D autoencoder,
pre-trained on the large-scale ABCD MRI dataset, achieving statistical
consistency through KL divergence loss. We employ a Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based encoder-decoder as the denoising network to optimize generation
quality. The framework flexibly incorporates conditional data, such as
functional network connectivity (FNC) data, enabling personalized brain
imaging, biomarker identification, and functional-to-structural information
translation for brain diseases like schizophrenia.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust methodology for identification of myeloid
blasts followed by prediction of genetic mutation in single-cell images of
blasts, tackling challenges associated with label accuracy and data noise. We
trained an initial binary classifier to distinguish between leukemic (blasts)
and non-leukemic cells images, achieving 90 percent accuracy. To evaluate the
models generalization, we applied this model to a separate large unlabeled
dataset and validated the predictions with two haemato-pathologists, finding an
approximate error rate of 20 percent in the leukemic and non-leukemic labels.
Assuming this level of label noise, we further trained a four-class model on
images predicted as blasts to classify specific mutations. The mutation labels
were known for only a bag of cell images extracted from a single slide. Despite
the tumor label noise, our mutation classification model achieved 85 percent
accuracy across four mutation classes, demonstrating resilience to label
inconsistencies. This study highlights the capability of machine learning
models to work with noisy labels effectively while providing accurate,
clinically relevant mutation predictions, which is promising for diagnostic
applications in areas such as haemato-pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景X光片（PX）成本低但缺乏深度信息，而CBCT虽提供3D信息但成本高且辐射大。现有重建模型需要CBCT扁平化或先验牙弓信息，临床中往往不可行。

Method: ViT-NeBLa结合Vision Transformers和NeBLa框架，采用马蹄形点采样策略和混合ViT-CNN架构，无需CBCT扁平化或先验信息。

Result: 实验表明，ViT-NeBLa在定量和定性上均显著优于现有方法，计算采样点减少52%。

Conclusion: ViT-NeBLa为牙科诊断提供了一种成本低、辐射少的3D重建替代方案。

Abstract: Dental diagnosis relies on two primary imaging modalities: panoramic
radiographs (PX) providing 2D oral cavity representations, and Cone-Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) offering detailed 3D anatomical information. While
PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information
limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks
including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited
accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by
requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable
clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural
Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX.
Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision
Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT
flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel
horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that
eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to
intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3)
replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior
global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash
positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample
points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding.
Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a
cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental
diagnostics.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), large neural networks pretrained on extensive and
diverse datasets, have revolutionized artificial intelligence and shown
significant promise in medical imaging by enabling robust performance with
limited labeled data. Although numerous surveys have reviewed the application
of FM in healthcare care, brain imaging remains underrepresented, despite its
critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases using
modalities such as MRI, CT, and PET. Existing reviews either marginalize brain
imaging or lack depth on the unique challenges and requirements of FM in this
domain, such as multimodal data integration, support for diverse clinical
tasks, and handling of heterogeneous, fragmented datasets.
  To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive and curated review of
FMs for brain imaging. We systematically analyze 161 brain imaging datasets and
86 FM architectures, providing information on key design choices, training
paradigms, and optimizations driving recent advances. Our review highlights the
leading models for various brain imaging tasks, summarizes their innovations,
and critically examines current limitations and blind spots in the literature.
We conclude by outlining future research directions to advance FM applications
in brain imaging, with the aim of fostering progress in both clinical and

Motivation: 解决高质量CT图像合成中标注数据有限和CT成像复杂性带来的挑战。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据显著提升了低剂量和稀疏视图重建等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 投影域合成是一种强大的数据增强工具，PRO展现了在多种CT应用中的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT images remains a signifi-cant challenge due to
the limited availability of annotat-ed data and the complex nature of CT
imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a novel framework that, to the best of
our knowledge, is the first to perform CT image synthesis in the projection
domain using latent diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches that operate
in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representa-tions from raw
projection data and leverages anatomi-cal text prompts for controllable
synthesis. This projec-tion domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of
underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions
as a foundation model, capa-ble of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks
by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results
demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves
perfor-mance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and
sparse-view reconstruction, even with limited training data. These findings
underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for
various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection
domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT
imaging. Our source code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging integrates diverse data types, such as structural

deep learning predictions and improve outcomes. This study focuses on a
neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional
neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model,
\textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base
model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally,
we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model
that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby
enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved
generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the
first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and
demonstrates strong scalability and portability.

*Stanley Lewis,Vishal Chandra,Tom Gao,Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPLATART是一种从姿态图像中学习高斯溅射表示的新方法，用于解决复杂铰接物体的表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接物体（如钳子、夹子、机器人手臂）的表示需要捕捉几何、颜色、部件分离和关节参数化，现有方法难以处理高自由度和深层运动树结构。

Method: SPLATART通过分离部件分割和关节估计任务，利用高斯溅射表示学习铰接物体的几何和运动特性。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实物体上展示了SPLATART的有效性，尤其适用于深层运动树结构。

Conclusion: SPLATART为复杂铰接物体的表示提供了一种新方法，扩展了现有技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Representing articulated objects remains a difficult problem within the field
of robotics. Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require
representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also
part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning
these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree
of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or
more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably
greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of
articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART -
a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects
from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations.
SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation
task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and
representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than
previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as
applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a
real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present
on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper
kinematic tree structures.

Motivation: 在部分和噪声观测下，精确估计物体姿态和接触点对灵巧操作至关重要。

Abstract: Mastering dexterous, contact-rich object manipulation demands precise
estimation of both in-hand object poses and external contact
locations$\unicode{x2013}$tasks particularly challenging due to partial and
noisy observations. We present ViTaSCOPE: Visuo-Tactile Simultaneous Contact
and Object Pose Estimation, an object-centric neural implicit representation
that fuses vision and high-resolution tactile feedback. By representing objects
as signed distance fields and distributed tactile feedback as neural shear
fields, ViTaSCOPE accurately localizes objects and registers extrinsic contacts
onto their 3D geometry as contact fields. Our method enables seamless reasoning
over complementary visuo-tactile cues by leveraging simulation for scalable
training and zero-shot transfers to the real-world by bridging the sim-to-real
gap. We evaluate our method through comprehensive simulated and real-world
experiments, demonstrating its capabilities in dexterous manipulation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过功能对应反馈提升视觉运动策略在分布外条件下泛化能力的方法，减少了重新训练的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端视觉运动策略在分布外（OOD）条件下表现不佳，而传统交互式模仿学习需要大量专家纠正演示，成本高且效率低。

Method: 通过检测OOD观察、请求功能对应反馈，并用分布内（ID）观察干预OOD观察，实现部署时泛化。

Result: 在真实机器人操作任务中验证了方法有效性，显著提升了视觉扩散策略对OOD对象和环境条件的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 功能对应反馈是一种低成本、高效的方法，可提升策略在OOD条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a
remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds,
or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit
corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be
costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does
not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can
directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities
with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with
in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.
The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally
correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an
expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of
collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our
method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current
observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training
observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence
feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD
observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse
real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.
Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the
generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and
environment conditions with low feedback.

Abstract: In the field of multi-sensor fusion for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), monocular cameras and IMUs are widely used to build simple and
effective visual-inertial systems. However, limited research has explored the
integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By
incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active
capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural
complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled
odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR
calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In
addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that
the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame
co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally,
the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform
motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further
enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh
insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active
SLAM systems in complex environments.

Result: 实验表明方法表现良好，但完全无误差的解决方案仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 方法在建筑场景的砖块抓取应用中展示了实际效果。

Abstract: Vision-based robotic object grasping is typically investigated in the context
of isolated objects or unstructured object sets in bin picking scenarios.
However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse
automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation
such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable
objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these
objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that
prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a
dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation
metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results
show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging
problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results
from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a
construction scenario.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接微调VLM存在时空差距，导致数据效率低且依赖人工。ROSA旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的实验表明，ROSA在低数据情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: ROSA通过改进对齐，显著提升了VLA模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in
multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in
developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with
the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly
fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers
from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and
heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level
semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical
space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models
anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve
alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state
estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model
to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting
performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in
low-data regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning
requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning
yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local
(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation
tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a
vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the
object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,
scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric
vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that
while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across
task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they
can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%
success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to
distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)
foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via
behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies
learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts
performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these
insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,
enabling robust, reusable low-level skills. Results and videos are available at

Motivation: 当前多模态重排序方法在训练策略和效果上仍有改进空间，且缺乏显式推理，难以进一步分析和优化。

Method: MM-R5采用两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），引入高质量推理数据构造策略和任务特定奖励框架。

Result: 在MMDocIR基准测试中，MM-R5在大多数指标上达到最优性能，召回率@1提升超过4%。

Conclusion: MM-R5通过推理增强的训练流程，为多模态重排序任务提供了更有效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text,
images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question
answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers
improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However,
current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant
room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.
Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and
optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal
Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,
aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal
reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving
instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and
high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data
construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the
RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking
reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward
to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5
achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable
results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the
best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results
validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and

Motivation: 现有方法中，仅使用RL的方法样本效率低且难以激活推理能力，而传统SFT-RL流程则限制了模型的探索能力并导致收敛不佳。

Method: Metis-RISE跳过初始SFT阶段，先通过RL（如GRPO变体）激活模型的潜在推理能力，再通过SFT解决RL阶段发现的两个关键问题：低效轨迹采样和基础能力缺失。

Conclusion: Metis-RISE通过RL激励和SFT增强的策略，显著提升了多模态推理模型的性能，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in
the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches
often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can
struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning
capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's
exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we
introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and
\textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike
conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,
beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy
Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning
capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges
identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks
where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which
we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;
and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting
expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This
strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement
forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B
parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard
demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

Conclusion: Stream-Omni通过关系驱动的模态对齐方法，实现了高效的多模态交互，减少数据依赖，同时支持多种模态组合的灵活交互。

Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the
exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more
flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate
representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a
large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is
straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on
large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model
the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more
efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose
Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality
alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various
modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the
vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is
semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension
concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically
consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension
mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve
modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer
of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual
understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction
tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously
provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model
responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal
experience.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature
on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic
music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and
reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed
papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to
evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,
computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting
significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing
research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on
simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the
credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like
Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results
is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the
evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship
attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin
Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the
opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve
disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable
guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed
to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological
validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies,
fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering
by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering
algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a
finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type
level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between
different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by
using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual
features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using
embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models,
including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance
document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent
document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document
classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and
limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues
for future research to understand and organize document collections.

Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and
train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However,
these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key
limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with
the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by
loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment
synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,
leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we
extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This
representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the
semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under
loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,
we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal
dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time
performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image
quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent
synthesis framework.

Abstract: Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education
and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing
technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex
dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.
Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues
such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and
orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and
importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper
presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment
generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process
method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)
model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object
into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second
stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The
key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context
perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling
strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed
paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in
challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless
hand-object interactions.

Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in
recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological
flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,
especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),
with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape
control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve
sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve
network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or
curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied
topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve
constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape
modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape
control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve
networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of
surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of
a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp
feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant
advantages of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在高反射场景中表现出色，通过硬件加速实现了高效的渲染。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis
performance at high rendering frame rates. Optimization-based inverse rendering
within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A
particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly
reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance
components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from
increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this
issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne
radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in
the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose,
we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test
time via unified material texture atlas.

Method: 利用预训练生成模型学习对象特定的分辨率映射，并通过滑动窗口应用模型。

Conclusion: UltraZoom系统在最小输入下实现了高质量的超高分辨率图像生成。

Abstract: We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of
objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a
full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,
high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and
scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance
paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to
learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply
the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these
pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full
image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,
robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,
in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables
seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,
photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.
