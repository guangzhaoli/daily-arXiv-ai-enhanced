*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结构化标注提升生成模型的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集（如LAION-5B）的噪声和无结构特性导致生成模型难以遵循提示，用户需依赖复杂的提示工程。

Method: 提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，包含19M高质量图像，标注采用四部分模板（主题、场景、美学、相机细节），并基于此微调PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2。

Result: 结构化标注显著提升了文本-图像对齐分数（通过VQA模型评估）。

Conclusion: 结构化标注是提升生成模型可控性和对齐性的有效方法。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/supermodelresearch/Re-LAION-Caption19M.

### [2] [CorrDetail: Visual Detail Enhanced Self-Correction for Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05302)
*Binjia Zhou,Hengrui Lou,Lizhe Chen,Haoyuan Li,Dawei Luo,Shuai Chen,Jie Lei,Zunlei Feng,Yijun Bei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CorrDetail的视觉细节增强自校正框架，用于可解释的人脸伪造检测，解决了现有方法在伪造细节解释和幻觉问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，人脸深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，亟需有效的深度伪造检测方法。现有方法在伪造细节解释和幻觉问题上存在不足。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误引导问题校正真实伪造细节，并引入视觉细粒度细节增强模块和融合决策策略。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节，并表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail框架在可解释性和性能上均表现出色，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

*Aquino Joctum,John Kandiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-APD是一种基于YOLOv8改进的深度学习架构，专为复杂道路上的行人检测设计，通过多种模块优化实现了高精度和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在几何复杂的道路（如Type-S曲面）上，传统RGB摄像头方法在行人检测中的局限性。

Method: 结合了SimAM注意力机制、C3Ghost模块、SimSPPF模块、Mish激活函数和IGD模块，并利用车辆转向动力学进行自适应ROI处理。

Result: 在CARLA数据集上达到77.7% mAP@0.5:0.95和96%的召回率，实时处理速度为100 FPS。

Conclusion: YOLO-APD在复杂环境中表现出高精度和高效性，为低成本传感器的感知系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

### [4] [Foreground-aware Virtual Staining for Accurate 3D Cell Morphological Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05383)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlight是一种虚拟染色方法，通过引导模型关注相关细胞结构，改进了形态学表示，同时保持像素级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法通常对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影的复制，而非关注生物意义信号。

Method: Spotlight使用基于直方图的前景估计来掩蔽像素级损失，并在软阈值预测上计算Dice损失，实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改进了形态学表示，同时保持像素级精度，更适合下游任务（如分割和分析）。

Conclusion: Spotlight提供了一种简单而强大的虚拟染色方法，显著提升了虚拟染色的质量和对下游任务的适用性。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了现有基础模型在农业任务中的有效性，提出了农业基础模型（CropFM）的需求框架，并呼吁开发专门针对农业的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人口增长和气候变化加剧，粮食安全成为全球关注问题，需要创新解决方案。基础模型在农业监测中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 定量评估现有基础模型，提出CropFM需求框架，并实证评估两个模型在三个农业任务中的表现。

Result: 现有通用基础模型在农业任务中表现有限，需开发专门针对农业的基础模型。

Conclusion: 农业领域需要专门的基础模型（CropFM）以提升农业监测效果。

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用深度学习改进水下图像质量，并整合人类主观评估以提升效果。

Method: 使用分类器网络区分高低质量图像，再用GAN模型基于多种增强标准优化低质量图像。

Result: 模型在颜色保真度和图像清晰度等标准下，显著提升了感知和测量的图像质量。

Conclusion: 结合人类主观评估的深度学习方法能有效提升水下图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

### [7] [pFedMMA: Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning with Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05394)
*Sajjad Ghiasvand,Mahnoosh Alizadeh,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pFedMMA是一个个性化的联邦学习框架，利用多模态适配器解决视觉语言任务中的泛化与个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在个性化联邦学习中往往牺牲泛化能力，难以处理未见过的类别或领域。

Method: pFedMMA采用多模态适配器，包含模态特定的上下投影层和全局共享的跨模态特征对齐投影层，并通过非对称优化策略实现本地个性化与全局泛化的平衡。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，pFedMMA在个性化和泛化之间取得了最佳平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA通过多模态适配器和共享投影层设计，有效解决了联邦学习中个性化和泛化的矛盾。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

TL;DR: LoongX是一种基于多模态神经生理信号的无手图像编辑方法，结合了BCI和生成模型，性能接近文本驱动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力有限的人群不友好，因此提出基于神经信号的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散模型和多种神经信号（EEG、fNIRS等），通过CS3和DGF模块处理信号，并与DiT对齐。

Result: 性能接近文本驱动方法（CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558），结合语音时表现更优（CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549）。

Conclusion: 神经驱动的生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，推动了认知驱动技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

*Lanqing Guo,Yufei Wang,Hezhen Hu,Yan Zheng,Yeying Jin,Siyu Huang,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D扩散编辑和逆渲染的3D高斯溅射场景局部编辑方法，解决了3D语义解析性能不足的问题，实现了高效且一致的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义解析在局部编辑中表现不佳，限制了编辑的精确性和一致性。

Method: 利用2D扩散编辑识别修改区域，通过逆渲染进行3D定位，结合深度图初始化粗粒度3DGS，迭代优化视图一致性和细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上达到最优，且速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景局部编辑提供了更高效和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Motivation: 解决基于开放语言提示的对象分割问题，需要模型将文本语义精确地映射到空间掩码，并处理多样化和未见过的类别。

Method: 结合SAM2和VLM的预训练组件，仅训练少量参数，引入位置嵌入和交叉注意力层增强空间理解。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的开放词汇语义、实例和全景分割性能。

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前诊断认知衰退（如阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍）的方法耗时且昂贵，导致许多病例未被及时发现。通过分析真实驾驶行为，提取与认知衰退相关的“数字指纹”，以早期识别和干预。

Method: 提出一个框架，结合大视觉模型和自然驾驶视频，分析驾驶员行为，分类认知状态并预测疾病进展。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于早期检测认知衰退，开发可扩展、非侵入性的监测系统，减轻老龄化社会中认知衰退的社会和经济负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

### [14] [Cloud Diffusion Part 1: Theory and Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05496)
*Andrew Randono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度不变噪声的扩散模型（Cloud Diffusion Model），以替代传统的白噪声扩散模型，旨在提升推理速度、高频细节和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像的低阶统计特性表现出尺度不变性，而传统扩散模型使用的白噪声不具备这种特性。因此，提出使用尺度不变噪声来更好地匹配自然图像的统计特性。

Method: 通过将尺度不变噪声（而非白噪声）引入扩散模型，构建Cloud Diffusion Model。

Result: 预期该模型能实现更快的推理速度、更好的高频细节和更高的可控性。

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Model有望改进传统扩散模型的性能，后续研究将具体实现并对比验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare

*Giulio Federico,Fabio Carrara,Claudio Gennaro,Giuseppe Amato,Marco Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet是一种新颖的多视图扩散架构，通过并行应用相同的扩散模型生成一致的多视图图像，解决了单图像生成多视图时的空间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像生成多视图时缺乏空间一致性会降低3D网格质量，因此需要一种能够生成高质量且一致的多视图图像的方法。

Method: LoomNet通过并行运行扩散模型，构建共享潜在空间以确保视图一致性。每个视图的推理生成编码，投影到三个正交平面并融合，最终生成一致的多视图图像。

Result: LoomNet在15秒内生成16个高质量且一致的多视图图像，在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有方法，并能生成多样且合理的新视图。

Conclusion: LoomNet通过共享潜在空间和并行扩散模型，有效解决了多视图图像生成的一致性问题，并在质量和效率上表现出色。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

Result: 3B模型在ViDoRe V1和V2上取得领先成绩（NDCG@5分别为91.0和63.5）。

Conclusion: 模型在多模态检索中表现优异，但需权衡存储和效率。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across
modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image
retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves
state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,
particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a
key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a
procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam
footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts
tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

TL;DR: ReLayout利用relation-CoT改进内容感知布局生成，解决现有LLM方法在空间关系解释和多样性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在布局生成中未能充分理解视觉主题与设计元素的空间关系，导致结构性和多样性问题。

Method: 通过引入显式关系定义（如区域、显著性和边距）增强布局标注，并设计布局原型再平衡采样器。

Result: 实验表明ReLayout优于基线方法，生成更结构化、多样且符合人类审美的布局。

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系分解和原型再平衡，显著提升了布局生成的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态转换引导网络（CTNet），用于解决多模态人脸防伪（FAS）中的分布差异和模态缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态FAS中，不同模态的数据分布差异大，且模态缺失时检测困难。活体样本的跨模态特征转换更一致，而活体与伪造样本的转换不一致。

Method: 通过学习活体样本的跨模态特征转换构建通用特征空间，并学习活体与伪造样本的不一致转换以检测OOD攻击。同时，从RGB模态学习补充IR和深度特征。

Result: CTNet在大多数协议中优于之前的两类多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet有效解决了多模态FAS中的分布差异和模态缺失问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缺陷检测方法效率低、成本高且鲁棒性有限，尤其在汽车、航空航天和医疗设备等高精度领域。

Method: 采用半监督框架，结合条件扩散模型生成多尺度伪缺陷样本，并利用CLIP跨模态特征过滤噪声。

Result: 在NEU-DET数据集上，使用相同标签数据时mAP@0.5达78.4%，仅需40%标签数据时达75.1%。

Conclusion: DSYM框架为工业质检提供了高精度、低标签依赖的解决方案，已开源。

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

Motivation: 现有方法在视频重建质量上表现良好，但解码速度慢且训练时间长，GSVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合变形场建模视频动态，动态感知时间切片策略自适应分组，以及量化感知微调优化压缩性能。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR解码速度提升10倍，训练时间大幅缩短，视频压缩性能优于NeRV。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频表示中实现了高效解码和快速训练，同时保持了高质量重建和压缩性能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的平面设计通常缺乏可编辑性，但非分层设计仍能启发设计师。因此，提出Accordion框架以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（VLM）分三个阶段执行任务，结合SAM和元素移除模型等视觉专家，以自上而下的方式分解图层。

Result: 在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，包括文本到模板、背景添加文本和文本去渲染等任务，并能生成设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion成功地将AI生成的设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像恢复中常出现不一致的保真度和不良伪影，KDS 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: KDS 使用 N 粒子集合的扩散样本，通过计算其输出的局部核密度估计梯度，引导样本朝向高密度区域。

Result: KDS 显著提升了超分辨率和图像修复任务的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS 是一种即插即用框架，无需重新训练或外部验证器，可无缝集成到各种扩散采样器中。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

Result: 生成图像更准确，支持未见过的身份，提升了数据效率和准确性。

Conclusion: GenHMC为虚拟形象动画提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应，有效解决了领域特定图像生成中的关键问题。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

Motivation: 现有CIR方法忽略了视觉数据中主导部分与噪声部分的不均匀性，以及文本数据在图像修改过程中的优先级，导致查询特征退化和视觉焦点偏差。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了OFFSET的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过减少噪声干扰和增强文本引导的焦点修正，显著提升了组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The
codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在边缘细节保留和区域同质性方面。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了PolSAR图像分类的精度和结构细节保留能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

Conclusion: DRA有效解决了新类别泛化问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，用于分析和逆转脑损伤过程，提高了病变分割和表征的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病变分割方法忽略了损伤与变形组织的区别，需要更精确的工具用于临床和研究。

Method: 使用扩散模型框架，先分割异常区域，再估计并逆转组织变形，最后修复核心病变区域。

Result: 与传统方法相比，提高了病变分割和表征的准确性，为脑损伤分析提供了可靠工具。

Conclusion: 该框架在脑损伤分析中表现出色，适用于临床和研究，但需进一步验证逆向过程的准确性。

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Conclusion: R-VLM通过结合视觉语言模型与传统目标检测技术，显著提升了GUI自动化的性能。

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Conclusion: 数据集和模型为医学视频生成研究提供了宝贵资源，有望推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

Result: 在基类到新类泛化、跨数据集评估和领域泛化三个任务上，ISP表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ISP通过结构建模和动态损失调整，显著提升了VLMs的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiON-LoRA是一种新型框架，通过线性可扩展性、正交性和范数一致性改进LoRA融合，实现对视频扩散模型中相机轨迹和物体运动的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LoRA可以在受限数据下学习特定的空间或时间运动，但实现相机轨迹和物体运动的精确控制仍然具有挑战性，主要由于融合不稳定和非线性可扩展性。

Method: LiON-LoRA通过分析浅层VDM中LoRA特征的正交性、强制层间范数一致性以及集成可控令牌到扩散变换器中，实现解耦控制和线性调整运动幅度。

Result: 实验表明，LiON-LoRA在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整方面优于现有方法，且能以最少训练数据实现卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA通过其核心原则显著提升了视频扩散模型的控制能力，为空间和时间可控性提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RGB和事件传感器的融合方法，用于航天器姿态估计，解决了极端光照条件下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB传感器在极端光照条件下表现不佳，而事件传感器动态范围高但分辨率低，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 使用光束分束棱镜实现光学和时间对齐，开发了RANSAC融合技术，并引入dropout不确定性估计。

Result: 在实验室多种光照条件下收集的数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 事件-RGB融合方法有效，支持事件传感器在航天器姿态估计中的应用，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是一个新的RGB-D数据集，用于研究6D物体姿态估计在真实世界光照和传感器变化下的性能，并探索测试时传感器控制的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在固定光照和相机设置下采集，未考虑真实世界的光照和传感器变化，限制了模型的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度捕捉模式和5种光照水平，生成101.9k RGB和10k深度图像。

Result: 实验表明，测试时传感器控制比数字数据增强更有效，性能接近或优于增加真实训练数据。多模态RGB-D配置联合调整效果最佳。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D扩展了6D姿态评估范式，为自适应感知系统在不确定环境中的鲁棒性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical

article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text

primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）时，忽视了其在空间关系推理中的固有局限性，导致关系预测不理想。

Method: SPADE框架包括两个关键步骤：(1) 基于反演引导的UNet校准，(2) 空间感知上下文推理。

Result: 在PSG和Visual Genome数据集上的实验表明，SPADE在封闭和开放场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知设计，显著提升了PSG任务中的关系预测能力。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

*Yuhuan Xie,Aoxuan Pan,Ming-Xian Lin,Wei Huang,Yi-Hua Huang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的“2D-3D-2D”框架，通过将2D对象提升为3D表示进行编辑，解决了现有2D图像编辑方法在一致性和对象身份保持上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在2D图像编辑中虽表现优异，但在一致性和对象身份保持上存在局限，主要因其基于像素操作的特性。

Method: 通过“2D-3D-2D”框架，先将2D对象转换为3D表示，在物理合理的3D环境中编辑，再将编辑后的3D对象重新投影并无缝修复回2D图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在整体性能和一致性上优于现有方法（如DragGAN和DragDiffusion），并能有效保持对象身份。

Conclusion: 该框架通过3D环境直接操作对象，显著提升了编辑的一致性和对象身份保持能力。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉基础模型（VFM）和大语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于提升视频理解中的因果推理和未来预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型缺乏常识性世界知识，难以完成高级认知任务。

Method: 通过Q-Former启发的融合模块，将视觉特征转化为语言对齐表示，结合两阶段训练策略（预训练和指令微调）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作将机器感知从简单识别推向认知理解，为更智能的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Conclusion: I²R方法通过解决语义差距和视觉相似性问题，显著提升了小样本分割的性能。

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在弱配对条件下，相邻切片间的空间异质性导致不准确的一对多映射，影响病理语义一致性。

Method: 采用不平衡自信息特征传输（USIGAN），结合UOT-CTM和PC-SCM机制，提取全局形态语义并构建相关性矩阵。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在IoD和Pearson-R相关性等临床指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: USIGAN方法有效解决了弱配对问题，提高了虚拟染色结果的临床相关性。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

TL;DR: DFYP是一种动态融合框架，通过结合光谱通道注意力、边缘自适应空间建模和可学习融合机制，提高了作物产量预测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在空间建模能力和跨作物类型及年份的泛化能力上存在不足，DFYP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DFYP包含三个关键组件：分辨率感知通道注意力模块、自适应算子学习网络和双分支架构的可学习融合机制。

Result: 在MODIS和Sentinel-2数据集上的实验表明，DFYP在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFYP在多种农业场景下表现出色，适用于实际农业监测。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D高斯点云序列的压缩是自由视点视频（FVV）中的关键挑战，现有方法通常依赖于优化依赖的编码，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用Group-of-Frames（GoF）结构和I-P帧编码，通过稀疏控制点提取帧间运动，并利用双先验感知熵模型压缩运动张量。

Result: 在保持视觉质量的同时，实现了超过40倍的压缩，且处理时间低于2秒，与基于优化的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3DGS的前馈压缩提供了新思路，推动了沉浸式应用中FVV的可扩展传输和存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型（RS-VLMs）局限于图像级和区域级任务，缺乏像素级任务处理能力，且在小目标识别和计算资源消耗方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出GeoMag框架，结合任务驱动的多粒度分辨率调整（TMRA）和提示引导的语义感知裁剪（PSC），动态优化任务相关区域的视觉表示并降低无关区域的分辨率。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，GeoMag在像素级任务中表现优异，同时在其他粒度任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag通过多粒度动态优化，显著提升了遥感图像解析的效率和性能，为高分辨率遥感图像处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Result: 模型在9个基准测试中表现最佳，适应不同缺失率和场景复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态数据缺失情况下表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

Method: 通过方法论和实验分析了五类十种解释指标（如忠实性、鲁棒性等）在五种特征归因方法（如Occlusion、LIME等）和三个RS数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RS场景分类中解释方法和指标的局限性，并提供了选择方法和参数的实用指南。

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Motivation: 现有大模型处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量无关视觉标记，影响性能。

Result: 在无标注数据上训练后，MGPO在多个基准测试中表现优于基线模型，甚至超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MGPO展示了强化学习在提升大模型视觉定位能力上的潜力，且无需额外标注成本。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Result: EDC和SV显著提升了VIS的鲁棒性，EDC在Swin-L骨干网上达到56.2 AP，创下OVIS基准的新记录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是提升视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率（通常为128^3），重建精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升了重建分辨率和效率，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有CIR方法依赖昂贵人工标注三元组的问题，提升可扩展性和零样本能力。

Method: 利用LLM生成多样化提示，控制文本到图像生成模型生成图像对，形成CIRHS数据集；提出CoAlign框架实现全局对齐和局部推理。

Result: 在零样本和监督训练中均表现优异，首次证明完全合成数据集训练CIR模型的可行性。

Conclusion: CIRHS和CoAlign为CIR任务提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现和跨模态融合有效提升了部分多标签学习的性能。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery
type or quality is often unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不依赖GNSS的点云地理配准方法，通过道路骨架和交叉点对齐点云与卫星图像，显著提升了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS信号受限的密集城区，现有方法依赖实时GNSS和IMU数据，但校准和稳定性假设常失效，导致定位误差。

Method: 使用预训练的Point Transformer分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局刚性对齐，再通过RBF插值局部优化，并基于SRTM地形数据校正高程。

Result: 在KITTI和Perth数据集上，平面配准精度分别提升55.3%和77.4%，高程相关性分别提升30.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无GNSS支持下的点云地理配准问题，适用于城市规模3D地图重建。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型无法生成清晰、准确的文本，限制了其在广告、教育等领域的应用。

Method: GCDA框架包含双流文本编码器、字符感知注意力机制和OCR微调阶段。

Result: GCDA在MARIO-10M和T2I-CompBench数据集上表现优异，字符错误率和词错误率显著降低。

Conclusion: GCDA为文本到图像模型中的文本生成问题提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Method: 提出VisualSpeaker，通过光真实感3D高斯点渲染和预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型，引入感知唇读损失。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，Lip Vertex Error降低56.1%，生成动画的感知质量显著提升，同时保留网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker在提升3D面部动画质量和准确性方面表现出色，尤其适用于手语虚拟角色中的口型准确性。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

Conclusion: MCAM在自动驾驶应用中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Conclusion: CAST-Phys数据集为非接触式情感识别技术提供了重要支持，展示了多模态融合在情绪识别中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production

images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all
trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum
training loss and maximum validation accuracy. Results showed that SoftReMish
achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%),
outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that
SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability,
making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于相似性矩阵的平滑算子，通过Sinkhorn算法归一化，适用于不规则数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拉普拉斯算子需要严格定义域结构，而简单卷积核和消息传递层对边界有偏置，需要更通用的平滑方法。

Method: 利用对称Sinkhorn算法将正平滑算子归一化为扩散类算子，继承拉普拉斯算子的优良性质。

Result: 新算子不仅能近似热扩散，还能保留拉普拉斯算子的谱信息，适用于点云等不规则数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为不规则数据提供了拉普拉斯式的平滑和处理能力，扩展了形状分析和匹配的应用。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

TL;DR: OmniPart是一个用于生成具有可编辑部分结构的3D对象的新框架，通过两阶段协同工作实现高语义解耦和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数生成方法只能生成整体形状，限制了交互应用的实用性，因此需要一种能够生成具有明确部分结构的3D资产的方法。

Method: OmniPart分为两个阶段：(1) 自回归结构规划模块生成可控的3D部分边界框；(2) 空间条件化的修正流模型在规划布局中同时合成所有3D部分。

Result: 实验表明，OmniPart在性能上达到最先进水平，支持用户定义的部分粒度、精确定位和多样化下游应用。

Conclusion: OmniPart为更可解释、可编辑和通用的3D内容铺平了道路。

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D
content.

Motivation: 当前视觉问答方法在科学数据解释中精度不足，特别是在数值处理和多步推理方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用5B到8B参数的模型进行实验，包括InternVL3和集成多个视觉语言模型。

Result: InternVL3在SciVQA测试集上ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L F1得分为0.740，BERTScore为0.983。集成模型进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 优化提示、链式推理和集成模型能有效提升科学视觉问答的能力。

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过合成文化数据集CulTwin和定制对比学习微调CLIP的方法，显著提升了模型在文化相关任务中的细粒度概念识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解方面表现优异，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难，主要原因是缺乏高质量的文化特定数据集和上下文知识。

Method: 设计了数据收集流程，利用开源视觉语言模型和文本到图像扩散模型构建合成文化数据集CulTwin，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，创建了CultureCLIP。

Result: 在文化相关基准测试中，CultureCLIP比基础CLIP表现更好，某些任务的细粒度概念识别能力提升了5.49%，同时保留了CLIP的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据合成和视觉语言模型训练范式，CultureCLIP能够有效捕捉细微的文化差异，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

Motivation: 传统语义场景补全方法依赖昂贵的标注数据，本文旨在探索无监督方法，减少对标注的依赖。

Method: 采用自监督表示学习和2D无监督场景理解技术，通过多视角一致性自监督训练，结合3D特征蒸馏获取无监督3D语义。

Result: 在3D和2D无监督场景理解中达到最先进的分割精度，线性探测3D特征与当前监督方法相当，并展示了领域泛化和多视角一致性。

Conclusion: SceneDINO为单图像3D场景理解提供了强大的基础，展示了无监督方法的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2提出了一种解耦范式，通过粗定位和精细分割的双阶段框架，结合CLIP和SAM的优势，显著提升了遥感图像分割的精度和语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂语义关系和跨模态对齐时存在局限性，主要原因是目标定位与边界划分的耦合机制导致误差传播和模型泛化性受限。

Method: RSRefSeg 2采用双阶段框架：CLIP用于粗定位和生成语义提示，SAM用于精细分割。通过级联二阶提示器优化语义提示，提升多实体场景下的精度。

Result: 在多个数据集（RefSegRS、RRSIS-D、RISBench）上，RSRefSeg 2的分割精度（gIoU）提升了约3%，且在复杂语义理解上表现更优。

Conclusion: RSRefSeg 2通过解耦设计和基础模型协作，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能和可解释性，为跨模态分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

Conclusion: AnthroTAP提供了一种高效且自动化的数据生成方法，显著提升了点跟踪模型的性能，同时降低了数据需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 软组织的模拟在医疗应用中越来越重要，但其高变形性带来了挑战，现有方法依赖分割、网格化和刚度估计，且需要精确的力反馈。

Method: 使用条件图神经网络（cGNN），输入表面点和施力位置，预测变形和受力；通过迁移学习（先模拟数据训练，再实验数据微调）解决数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟环境中软组织模拟提供了有效解决方案，不仅适用于医疗模拟，还可推广到其他需要真实软组织模拟的领域。

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Result: 揭示了模型决策中的潜在电路和信息流，帮助识别虚假相关性并增强模型可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架是模型无关且可扩展的，有助于深入理解深度学习模型在数据偏差下的泛化行为。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域泛化（DG）方法未考虑算法公平性，而公平性方法未考虑领域偏移，因此需要结合两者。

Method: 通过信息论视角推导多类分类任务中预期风险和公平性违规的上界，并设计PAFDG框架进行帕累托优化。

Result: 实验表明PAFDG在真实数据集上优于现有方法，实现了更好的效用-公平性权衡。

Conclusion: PAFDG成功解决了FairDG问题，为领域泛化和算法公平性的结合提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实中双因素认证因头戴显示器遮挡视线而难以实现，需要一种无需摘除设备的解决方案。

Method: 提出NRXR-ID技术，利用智能手机完成认证挑战，包括四种挑战类型（如棋盘式挑战）和三种配置（如基于凝视的选择）。

Result: 棋盘式视觉匹配挑战表现最佳，其次是智能手机输入PIN码并在VR环境中提交。

Conclusion: NRXR-ID技术可行，棋盘式挑战是最优选择，为VR环境下的双因素认证提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

Conclusion: PWD通过先验信息嵌入和小波特征融合，显著提高了LACT重建的效率和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

TL;DR: HA2HA是一种自监督去噪框架，显著提升超声微血管成像的信噪比和对比噪声比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声微血管成像中低信噪比的问题，尤其是在无对比剂或深部组织场景下。

Method: 利用互补角度的射频血流数据构建训练对，血管信号一致而噪声变化。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，信噪比和对比噪声比提升超过15 dB，改善了微血管血流可视化。

Conclusion: HA2HA为无对比剂和对比增强的超声微血管成像提供了无标签、通用且临床适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割在CT扫描中至关重要，但分割标注稀缺且耗时，而放射学报告数量庞大，如何利用报告提升分割性能是关键。

Method: 通过R-Super将放射学报告转化为体素监督，结合公开和内部数据集进行训练。

Result: 在内部和外部验证中，F1分数最高提升16%，尤其在标注稀缺时效果显著。

Conclusion: R-Super通过利用放射学报告，显著提升了肿瘤分割AI的性能，适用于标注稀缺或丰富的情况。

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

Motivation: 现有方法在噪声测量下表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的重建方法。

Method: 将LACT视为正弦图修复任务，采用MR-SDE扩散框架和RNSD+噪声感知机制。

Result: 在数据一致性和感知质量上优于基线模型，且适应不同噪声强度和采集场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下表现出色，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

Conclusion: ADPv2数据集支持器官特异性深入研究，并公开可用。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared
trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across
different tasks.

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.
These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale
data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to
characterize plaque composition.

TL;DR: 通过多模态学习和可学习配准模块提升CBCT到sCT的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像存在伪影和视觉质量低的问题，而合成CT（sCT）生成是一种解决方案。

Method: 提出一种端到端可学习的配准模块，结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据进行多模态学习。

Result: 在90种评估设置中，79种优于基线方法，尤其在CBCT质量低且CT配准中度偏差时效果显著。

Conclusion: 多模态学习结合配准模块能显著提升sCT生成质量。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LangMamba利用语言驱动的Mamba框架和视觉语言模型（VLM）提升低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪效果，通过语义增强和双空间对齐显著提高图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射但图像质量下降，现有深度学习方法忽略高层语义信息，而语言模型能提供结构化语义指导。

Method: 两阶段学习：1）预训练语言引导自编码器（LangAE）将正常剂量CT映射到语义空间；2）结合SEED模块和LangDA损失，增强语义并对齐感知与语义空间。

Result: LangMamba在公开数据集上优于现有方法，提升细节保留和视觉保真度，LangAE具强泛化性，LangDA损失增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 语言作为监督信号在LDCT去噪中潜力巨大，LangMamba为语言引导图像重建提供新思路。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on
https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Result: 在BCIC IV 2a数据集上验证，性能提升3.28%。

Conclusion: 首次提出提取纯共同特征并构建跨被试通用模型的方法，推动了BCI技术的广泛应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Motivation: 由于3D网格的非欧几里得性质，传统CNN难以处理，而现有GCN方法因使用各向同性滤波器或谱分解，无法同时捕捉局部和全局特征。

Method: 提出3DGeoMeshNet，采用多尺度编码器-解码器结构，保留原始多边形网格格式，通过全局和局部路径分别捕捉大尺度几何结构和细粒度细节。

Result: 在COMA数据集上的实验表明，3DGeoMeshNet在重建精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接在空间域中学习特征，避免了中间表示转换，实现了更准确的3D网格重建。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅需要精心拍摄的图像覆盖整个场景，限制了普通用户的可用性。LighthouseGS旨在通过简单的全景运动实现高质量渲染。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力，为普通用户提供了便捷的高质量新视角合成方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

TL;DR: 提出TigAug方法，自动增强交通灯图像以测试ADS中的交通灯检测模型，解决了手动数据收集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通灯检测模型测试方法依赖手动数据收集，效率低且难以覆盖多样环境。

Method: 基于天气、相机和交通灯特性，构建蜕变关系和变换家族，自动生成增强图像。

Result: 实验证明TigAug能有效测试模型、高效合成图像且生成图像自然度可接受。

Conclusion: TigAug为交通灯检测模型的自动化测试和性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamGrasp利用预训练图像生成模型的想象力推断场景未观察部分，实现复杂环境下的鲁棒3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏RGB图像下部分视图3D识别的挑战，特别是在杂乱、遮挡的真实场景中。

Method: 结合粗粒度3D重建、对比学习的实例分割和文本引导的实例级细化。

Result: 实验显示DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何形状，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp克服了现有方法的局限性，适用于复杂多对象环境。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

TL;DR: 3DGS-LSR是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的大规模重定位框架，仅需单目RGB图像即可实现厘米级定位，适用于复杂城市环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNSS在复杂城市环境中信号遮挡和多径效应导致的不可靠定位问题，同时克服传统地图方法在存储和计算效率上的限制。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，使用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，平均定位精度在城镇道路、林荫道和交通密集高速公路上分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人提供了在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中可靠的定位能力，仅需单目RGB输入。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

TL;DR: ECORE框架通过动态路由策略优化边缘设备上的能耗与检测精度，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中实时视觉分析任务对资源受限设备的高需求，需平衡能耗与检测精度。

Method: 提出ECORE框架，集成动态路由策略（估计技术和贪婪算法）选择最佳设备-模型对。

Result: 实验显示能耗降低45%，延迟减少49%，检测精度仅损失2%。

Conclusion: ECORE有效平衡能耗与性能，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.
