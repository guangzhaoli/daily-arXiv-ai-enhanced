Result: 提供了在遥感数据价值链中应用降维技术的实用手册，识别了尚未充分探索的降维算法及其在未来研究中的应用机会。

Conclusion: 降维技术是解决地球观测数据高维挑战的关键工具，本综述为相关研究提供了系统指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的视觉标记，能够自然地融入现实环境，通过微小视觉修改实现隐蔽的6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉标记在美学等方面过于显眼，需要一种能够隐蔽融入环境的标记方案。

Method: 使用端到端深度学习方法，训练编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，通过微小视觉修改实现隐蔽标记。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在需要隐蔽标记的场景中具有重要价值，适用于增强现实、机器人技术等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动驾驶的两阶段视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了高级驾驶问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的问答需求，利用预训练视觉语言模型的能力，通过多模态输入和上下文增强来提高问答准确性。

Method: 第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和少样本提示链；第二阶段加入nuScenes场景元数据和任务特定提示。采用自一致性集成提高答案可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中，第一阶段使用5帧历史和10样本提示达到65.1%准确率（零样本为62.61%），自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%总体准确率，在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的表现，证明了该方法在自动驾驶领域的有效性。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，解决纵向医学影像序列中不规则时间间隔的高分辨率图像建模问题，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法充分利用纵向医学影像序列中的空间和时间信息，要么将空间信息压缩为向量，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 采用连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差显式集成到状态转移中，并配合多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕捉时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分优于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型的时序一致性和物理合理性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在生成复杂运动时缺乏时序一致性和物理合理性，而现有方法使用的视频编码器特征将外观和动态信息混在一起，限制了改进效果

Method: 学习解耦的运动子空间来预测真实光流，然后将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与该运动子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识

Result: 在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上，该方法显著提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了对文本提示的遵循

Conclusion: 该运动中心对齐框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动质量问题，为文本到视频模型提供了更好的运动理解能力

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，比现有指标更好地反映人类评分。同时提出了DOCENT数据集来验证PoSh的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误。需要一种能够定位具体文本错误并评估组合理解的指标。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，通过LLM作为评判者来生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。DOCENT数据集包含艺术作品、专家撰写的参考描述以及模型生成的描述，并附有艺术史学生的质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断的相关性比最佳开放权重替代方案强0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且是一个有效的奖励函数，优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为评估详细图像描述提供了更好的工具，发现基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时难以实现完整、无错误的覆盖，这为VLM进展设定了具有挑战性的新任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR是一个统一的人体姿态表示学习管道，通过对比学习对齐图像、2D和3D姿态表示，在多模态融合和生成任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体姿态表示在人机交互、动作识别等应用中至关重要，但不同模态（图像、2D关键点、3D骨架等）之间的关联性研究有限，缺乏统一的多模态对齐方法。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，采用基于奇异值的新型对比学习损失函数，同时对齐多个数据表示。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE为51.6mm；在Human3.6M上实现2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过有效的多模态对齐方法，为人体姿态相关任务提供了统一的表示学习解决方案，在姿态估计和检索任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中难以准确描绘不规则形状和模糊边界，且高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕获复杂细节并优先处理信息区域；同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

*Eyad Gad,Mustafa Abou Khatwa,Mustafa A. Elattar,Sahar Selim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究针对乳腺癌超声图像分割中非独立同分布数据带来的挑战，提出结合FedProx联邦学习方法和改进U-Net模型的方法，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像作为可靠且成本效益高的工具，但医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且私密的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但非独立同分布数据会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌数据集，并采用带有注意力机制的改进U-Net模型来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法实现了全局模型96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割精度同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有潜力，是解决隐私保护和模型准确性平衡问题的有前景方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流来促进团队战术学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了同步的自我中心多智能体学习特性，需要从个体视角建模团队战术

Method: 引入X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时职业CS2比赛录像）和跨自我中心对比学习（CECL）方法，对齐队友的自我中心视觉流以培养团队战术意识

Result: CECL在队友-对手位置预测任务上表现优异，能够从单一第一人称视角有效推断队友和对手位置

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文应用深度网络自动检测疟疾感染细胞，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet在公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率分别达97.28%和97.55%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断依赖人工显微镜观察血涂片图像，存在专业知识不足和人为错误风险，需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统提高准确性和可靠性。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深层特征并进行分类。

Result: 残差注意力网络和XceptionNet在疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最优，准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的方法能够实现疟疾的自动可靠检测，最小化人工参与，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存剪枝来缓解多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，减少对冗余视觉token的关注，提高对关键视觉信息的注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题严重，现有方法通常需要额外训练或引入额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与对视觉token的注意力分配不足密切相关，冗余视觉token分散了模型注意力。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存剪枝技术，增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流幻觉评估基准上使用四种主流MLLMs进行评估，取得了稳健且优异的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token剪枝应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性、无需训练、成本低等优势，为幻觉问题提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强图像到视频生成任务的时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注视频整体质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中时序一致性往往表现不佳，需要专门解决时序一致性问题。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，然后使用基于奖励的微调框架对视频生成模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不会降低其他性能表现。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强指标，能够在不牺牲其他性能的前提下显著改善图像到视频生成任务的时序连贯性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知视频编辑生成多视角真实视频，显著提升角点案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽略了自动驾驶性能关键的下游感知任务评估。现有合成数据训练策略需要两倍epoch，当基线也使用双倍epoch时，合成数据的优势变得微不足道。

Method: 首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资源渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型生成编辑后的多视角真实视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够大规模生成多视角角点案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角点案例感知能力。实验表明该框架能有效提升下游感知模型在不同训练epoch下的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶感知任务提供了前所未有的灵活性，并贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资源数据集，促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: MoE-GS是一个统一框架，通过集成多个专门专家和体积感知像素路由器来改进动态3D高斯溅射，提高渲染质量但降低了效率，因此提出了优化策略和蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景中表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，集成多个专门专家，使用体积感知像素路由器通过可微分权重溅射将体积高斯级权重投影到像素空间，确保时空一致性。同时探索单通道多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoE-GS在提高效率的同时持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术引入动态高斯溅射的方法，通过专家集成和优化策略实现了更好的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和准确速度测量的优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示并阻碍了多模态融合

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体的二次表面参数，生成表面伪点云来缓解雷达点稀疏性；使用预测的深度将图像特征从透视视图转换到统一的鸟瞰视图进行多模态融合；采用基于柱体的方法处理点云特征

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft(VoD)物体检测基准测试中实现了优越性能

Conclusion: SFGFusion能够有效融合相机和4D雷达特征，提高物体检测的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景感知协作感知框架，通过课程学习策略将背景上下文信息压缩到前景特征中，在不传输背景的情况下提高感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的协作感知方法为了节省带宽只传输前景区域特征，但丢弃了包含重要上下文信息的背景，限制了感知性能。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索，后期逐步剪除背景，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将背景上下文封装到紧凑的前景特征中，实现了有效的上下文丰富的前景共享，提高了协作感知性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保持单步生成效率的同时，显著提升了超分辨率图像的结构质量和感知质量，为真实图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法大多依赖计算密集型模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏策略，集成参数无关的注意力机制，并开发混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别准确率达92.12%，能耗仅136.16 pJ，处理速度为8.84个动作/秒，解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct框架在保持高识别精度的同时显著提升了效率，特别适合资源受限的MAV平台，实现了低能耗、低计算的实时动作识别。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: D2D是一个新颖框架，将不可微分的检测模型转化为可微分的批评器，利用其优越的计数能力来指导文本到图像扩散模型生成正确数量的对象。

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成提示中指定数量的对象时存在困难。现有方法通常使用回归模型作为外部批评器，但排除了计数能力更强的检测器模型，因为它们的枚举计数本质是不可微分的。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等多个模型上，在四个不同复杂度的基准测试中（低密度、高密度和多对象场景）都实现了对象计数准确性的显著提升（例如在D2D-Small基准上提升高达13.7%），同时图像质量和计算开销几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将检测模型的强大计数能力整合到文本到图像生成过程中，显著提高了对象计数的准确性，为解决扩散模型中的计数问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Result: 在MSDS和DeepSignDB等基准数据集上的实验表明，TS-GATR超越了当前最先进的方法，在各种场景下都实现了更低的等错误率。

Conclusion: TS-GATR通过有效的时空建模为动态签名验证提供了强大的解决方案，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

### [28] [Seabed-Net: A multi-task network for joint bathymetry estimation and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery in shallow waters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19329)
*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，可同时从遥感图像预测水深和海底分类，通过跨任务特征融合和动态任务权重平衡，显著提升浅水环境测绘精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互促进作用，限制了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质海岸站点评估中，比传统方法降低75% RMSE，比最先进的单任务和多任务基线降低10-30%水深RMSE，提高海底分类精度达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底栖息地可产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供鲁棒的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了尺度偏移领域泛化这一新颖且具有应用价值的研究方向的重要性，并为未来研究提供了四个重要见解。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

### [30] [BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332)
*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，避免了传统VAE管道的使用，在减少71.7%参数的同时实现了竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将fMRI映射到CLIP最终语义层并添加VAE管道来捕获细节，但忽视了CLIP中间层的丰富对象信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将功能不同视觉区域（低/高层次）的fMRI信号对齐到对应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和新型多粒度损失函数。

Result: BrainMCLIP在高层语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法性能，同时参数减少71.7%，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP有效捕获了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节，无需单独VAE管道即可实现语义准确性和细节保真度的平衡。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

### [31] [A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333)
*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集图像分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开放词汇识别，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分割方法需要大量标注数据且难以处理开放词汇场景，本文旨在开发一种无需训练即可实现开集分割与识别的灵活框架。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）使用EfficientNetB0提取特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2）利用CLIP的视觉和文本编码器进行跨模态对齐，通过投影后的嵌入相似度进行识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等基准测试中，在匈牙利mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练即可实现有效、灵活和可泛化的开集图像分割与识别的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DaMo展示了强大的预测能力和泛化性，在不同模型架构上保持有效性，为移动手机代理的多任务学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

*Ahsan Raza Siyal,Markus Haltmeier,Ruth Steiger,Malik Galijasevic,Elke Ruth Gizewski,Astrid Ellen Grams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE是一个新颖的医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来平衡配准的稳定性和灵活性，同时防止非物理变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中忽略了正则化对鲁棒性和解剖学合理性的重要作用，容易产生非物理伪影和过度平滑问题。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制来惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠现象，避免了过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE框架通过自适应正则化策略在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖学合理性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

*Woo Jae Kim,Kyu Beom Han,Yoonki Cho,Youngju Na,Junsik Jung,Sooel Son,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF通过引入可学习的敏感度场来量化几何扰动对渲染质量的影响，从而在保护NeRF模型知识产权的同时保持高质量的视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的重要工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权的使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间（如网格）中，因为扰动3D几何容易导致场景结构变形和渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场在NeRF模型的预渲染输出（颜色和体积密度）中注入对抗性扰动以欺骗未经授权的下游目标模型；敏感度场学习敏感度来自适应约束几何扰动，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的使用。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态（包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位）中具有通用适用性，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF通过创新的敏感度场机制，有效解决了NeRF模型知识产权保护中几何扰动与渲染质量之间的平衡问题，为NeRF模型的商业化应用提供了可靠的安全保障。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要集中在单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台的标配，但VLM能否有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 构建了包含8个子任务的MV-RoboBench基准，评估了包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM，并采用了CoT启发技术增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的性能远低于人类水平，多视角机器人感知面临重大挑战；空间智能与机器人任务执行呈正相关；现有单视角基准的强性能不能可靠地转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的进步，提供标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于脚部位置对齐的方法能有效克服广角摄像头畸变问题，显著提高多摄像头系统中工人位置追踪的准确性。

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务上表现出色，但在主观情感分析领域应用不足，特别是在心理分析这样的专业领域存在空白

Method: 采用分层分析方法：1）将复杂图像分解为语义子图；2）三个层次分析（单对象、多对象、整体）；3）引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块；4）使用强化学习训练生成心理特征档案；5）整合多层面信息进行综合评估

Conclusion: PICK填补了MLLMs与专业领域之间的鸿沟，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决工业场景下高度不平衡数据分类问题提供了有效解决方案，推动了自动光学检测技术在IC制造中的应用。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的四个深度薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，捕获通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197，生成的图像显示出比随机提取的真实子图像更优的代表性（双约束误差1.9-11.3% vs 36.4-578%）。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描时间过长限制临床效率，需要创新方法来加速成像过程

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为先验信息，用于重建高度欠采样的k空间数据，模型可基于多种数据源进行条件生成

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，该方法在4倍、8倍和12倍高加速因子下均显著优于其他方法

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN提出了一种基于模式重用图卷积网络的单目3D人体姿态估计方法，通过跨序列的模式检索和适应来解决深度模糊问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视频的方法在处理每个序列时都是孤立的，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的强结构规律性和重复运动模式。本文旨在通过跨序列模式重用的机制来推进该领域发展。

Method: PRGCN框架包含一个图记忆库，学习并存储紧凑的姿势原型作为关系图，通过注意力机制动态检索这些原型作为结构化先验，并通过记忆驱动的图卷积与硬编码的解剖约束自适应融合。采用双流混合架构，结合Mamba状态空间模型的线性复杂度局部时间建模和自注意力的全局关系能力。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，建立了新的最先进性能，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用这一长期被忽视的机制对于推进单目3D人体姿态估计领域至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过重采样和插补方法解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的甲烷羽流检测偏差问题，提高低覆盖率图像中的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像存在系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡），这些非随机缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联，导致低覆盖率图像中的检测不足。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系，并提出了一种加权重采样方案，通过在训练过程中强制每个覆盖率区间内的类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 实验结果表明，重采样和插补方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中评估显示，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏技术能有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的检测偏差问题，提高甲烷羽流检测在低覆盖率图像中的可靠性。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 单源域泛化目标检测中，模型容易陷入虚假相关性的陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征（如颜色）而非本质的域不变表示（如物体轮廓）。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）跨注意力提示模块通过视觉提示与跨注意力结合减轻虚假特征偏差；2）双分支适配器通过高频特征提取实现因果-虚假特征解耦和域适应。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上比现有域泛化方法提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化中的虚假相关性问题，实现了状态领先的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: CARES是一个轻量级预处理模块，通过预测最小足够输入分辨率来减少视觉语言模型的计算开销和延迟，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉令牌占总令牌的97-99%，即使低分辨率图像足够时也会造成高计算成本和延迟。

Method: CARES使用紧凑的VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM的响应何时收敛到其峰值回答能力。虽然作为离散分类器训练，但在推理时可以对连续分辨率进行插值以实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个涵盖文档和自然图像的多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，将计算量减少了高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能分辨率选择有效解决了VLM中视觉令牌过多的问题，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理重叠度小或无重叠的图像对时效果不佳，视频插值方法生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低。

Method: 提出Hybrid Video Generation（HVG）结合视频插值模型和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，使用Feature Matching Selector（FMS）基于特征对应选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，PoseCrafter相比现有SOTA方法显著提升了姿态估计性能。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的姿态估计挑战，特别是在困难场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现出色，但在视觉推理方面仍存在明显缺陷，如难以识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体。本研究旨在深入探究VLMs失败的根本原因，并提出针对性改进方法。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究7个SOTA VLMs的计数能力，进行分层分析，发现错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。通过仅微调输出层进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验表明VLMs对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。仅微调输出层即可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: VLMs的视觉推理能力存在根本性限制，但通过针对输出层的简单微调可以显著改善性能。分层分析揭示了模型失败的深层原因，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 尽管提示工程是T2I模型的主要交互方式，但提示复杂度对合成数据质量、多样性和一致性等关键效用维度的系统性影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 首先通过合成实验验证泛化难度，然后引入新的评估框架比较真实数据和合成数据的效用，并在多个数据集上分析提示复杂度的影响。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少分布偏移；提示扩展方法在图像多样性和美学方面表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 当前推理时干预方法可以增加生成多样性但会偏离真实数据支持，提示扩展通过使用预训练语言模型作为似然估计器，在多样性和美学方面表现最优。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）具有通用化和表达性强的多模态表示能力，但它们在时间感知方面的能力尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在评估VLMs对视觉内容进行时间定位的能力。

Method: 引入了TIME10k基准数据集（包含10,000多张带时间真实标签的图像），评估了37个VLMs的时间感知能力，发现时间信息在嵌入空间中沿低维非线性流形结构化，并提出了从嵌入空间推导明确时间线表示的方法。

Result: 时间线表示方法在时间推理任务中达到了与基于提示的基线方法相当或更优的准确率，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: VLMs的嵌入空间中存在结构化的时间信息，可以通过提出的时间线表示方法有效建模时间及其时间顺序，为时间推理任务提供支持。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: HAD框架采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失，明确建模和缓解时空不对称性。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多模态融合中的时空不对称问题，为挑战性条件下的目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 揭示了视频感知系统中一个未被探索的漏洞，强调需要开发考虑alpha通道的防御机制

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD框架验证了其在环绕视图重建中的可扩展性和高保真度，通过显式几何学习和语义质量提升的协同作用实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在多焦点图像融合领域取得了重要进展，为解决复杂融合挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的不确定性估计相比标准图像分类面临独特挑战，需要可扩展的逐像素估计方法。现有研究主要集中在场景理解或医学影像领域，缺乏针对遥感应用的专门评估。

Method: 在两个遥感数据集（PASTIS和ForTy）上进行实验，评估了随机分割网络、集成方法等多种模型，结合不同神经网络架构和不确定性度量指标进行综合分析。

Result: 通过大量实验评估，发现不同方法在识别预测错误和噪声区域方面的表现差异，为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了多项实用建议，为遥感图像语义分割中的不确定性估计提供了具体指导。

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecAF是一种无需训练的注意力融合方法，通过对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合机制，将多模态大语言模型的注意力图转换为视频分割掩码，性能优于其他免训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要联合训练MLLMs和SAM，而本文希望开发一种完全无需重新训练的方法来实现视频理解分割。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)：1)对比性对象-背景融合抑制无关激活；2)互补视频帧融合增强对象聚焦线索；结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获取精细掩码。

Result: DecAF在引用和推理VOS基准测试中优于免训练方法，性能与基于训练的方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了无需训练即可有效利用MLLMs注意力进行视频分割的可行性，为训练自由的视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: CBDiff采用条件伯努利扩散模型，在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以更好地反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制利用语义特征指导。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多样化的伪造定位图有效解决了伪造区域的不确定性问题，为图像伪造检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准测试XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像定位能力上存在不足，特别是在小病灶或弥散性病变上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在医学图像理解方面表现出卓越的零样本性能，但其在医学领域的定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未得到充分探索，而可靠的定位对于临床可解释性和应用至关重要。

Method: 研究使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多病理学上的对齐程度。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型变体在大而明确的病变上表现出合理的定位能力，但在小或弥散性病变上性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型表现出更好的对齐；(3)模型的整体识别能力与定位能力高度相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管具有较强的识别能力，但在临床可靠的定位方面仍存在不足，强调了在医疗实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来捕捉图像几何规律性，达到卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的渐近极小极大界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的稀疏估计器无法适应复杂信号规律性，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当α≤2时，小波、曲波等帧方法都是次优的。深度学习卷积网络虽然取得了更好结果，但需要更简化的谐波分析方法。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化卷积神经网络模型，通过第二次小波变换计算小波系数模值。提出联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集ℓ¹范数的去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明该去噪估计器达到了卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的渐近极小极大界，并将此数值结果表述为数学猜想。

Conclusion: 该方法为信号去噪和函数几何规律性描述提供了不同的谐波分析途径，在谐波分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Motivation: 解决异构智能体协作中的领域差距问题，现有方法因需要重新训练编码器或核心模块而破坏语义一致性，且整合新智能体计算成本高。

Method: 使用可变形消息提取器提取空间信息，通过条件扩散模型生成与自我智能体语义空间对齐的特征，最后通过通道增强器进行特征融合。

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、轻量级的异构多智能体协作解决方案，显著提升了感知能力并降低了系统扩展成本。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR是一个无需外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架，通过两阶段训练解决现有方法的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分不足问题，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法面临三个关键瓶颈：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间的边界模糊性、以及细粒度语义区分不足。这些问题导致模型陷入局部最优，缺乏鲁棒的边界和语义区分能力。

Method: 提出AMR框架，采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。原始查询使用冻结的基础查询进行DETR定位，主动查询动态适应真实数据分布。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，AMR实现了比先前最先进方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不增加额外数据的情况下解决现有标注中的模糊边界信息和语义混淆问题，同时保持边界和语义区分能力，并推广到真实世界场景，显著提高了时刻检索的性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医疗领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏大规模高质量医疗影像数据集以及忽视了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建了84K QA对的CT-RATE-VQA数据集；提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域来突出全局定位和疾病细节；引入GRPO强化学习框架实现无需人工标注的有效推理。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据集构建和显式推理策略，显著提升了医疗VLM的诊断性能，为医疗AI诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的密度化准则和重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除过重建伪影，在复杂场景中实现更优的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法认为这是大尺度高斯分布分裂不足导致的，但作者发现根本原因是密度化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法：1）重要性感知密度化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域停滞的基元生长；2）重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视角合成指标上达到最优性能，同时保留了精细的几何细节。该方法还能与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成，带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中的根本问题，具有广泛的适用性，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in

TL;DR: 提出了CST框架，在无配对图像翻译中显式保留细曲线结构，通过集成结构一致性训练来增强现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学图像翻译中常扭曲细曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线提取模块进行拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中，在CycleGAN和UNSB两个代表性骨干网络上进行了验证

Result: 在三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过增强学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学图像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了原则性途径

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，用于为基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统提供视觉解释，以提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度学习模型在呈现攻击检测中虽然有效，但大多作为黑箱运行，决策过程不透明。解释性技术旨在提供DL模型行为或决策背后的详细信息，特别是视觉解释对于理解DL-based PAD系统的决策至关重要。

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，通过集成多个类激活映射来生成视觉解释，确定导致生物识别图像被系统判定为真实或伪造的关键区域。

Result: 该方法能够为基于深度学习的面部PAD系统提供详细的视觉解释，帮助用户理解模型的决策依据。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够增强DL-based面部PAD系统的透明度和可信度，通过提供更好的行为理解来改进系统性能。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态变量，在多种动态系统上实现准确且物理可解释的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够学习鲁棒稳定潜在表示的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动具有不变性，在预测误差上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ框架解决QAT中激活分布非均匀和权重量化码本不匹配问题，通过自适应权重量化方案和硬件友好的非均匀-均匀映射，在低比特量化下实现优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的非均匀分布特性，以及权重量化中使用的静态不匹配码本问题

Method: 提出自适应分布感知量化(ADQ)框架，包含三个核心创新：基于分位数的码本初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及灵敏度感知的混合精度分配策略

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18在平均2.81比特宽度下达到71.512%的Top-1准确率，优于同类先进方法；CIFAR-10上的消融实验验证了各组件贡献

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应量化方案有效解决了QAT中的关键挑战，在保持低比特量化的同时实现了优越性能

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器，支持文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并引入参考运动作为新条件信号提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多模态人体运动生成中任务单一、生成内容一致性不足的问题，构建一个统一框架支持多样化任务和高质量运动生成。

Method: 提出自回归扩散变换器的序列到序列框架，引入参考运动条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，并构建大规模多模态数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现最先进性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动序列。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X为多模态人体运动生成提供了一个强大且统一的解决方案，通过创新的条件信号和训练策略实现了高质量的交互式运动生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法忽略长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类间的混淆问题，导致模型在分布偏移时性能下降

Method: CPL-NC包含类感知原型缓存模块（动态调整每类容量并包含罕见类别知识恢复机制）和负对比学习机制（识别并约束难视觉-文本负样本），采用非对称优化仅优化文本原型

Result: 在15个基准测试上，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有TTA方法

Conclusion: CPL-NC是轻量级TTA框架，能有效解决原型退化和类间混淆问题，显著提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化性能

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为下一代文本引导图像编辑模型的训练和基准测试提供了坚实基础，推动了多模态编辑研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有评估指标的选择多样且其权衡和行为未被充分理解，需要定量分析这些指标对地面真实值扰动的敏感性。

Method: 通过定量分析现有指标对各种地面真实值扰动的敏感性，特别是与人类判断的比较，提出了基于相对表面法向量的新指标、新的深度可视化工具以及创建更好人类对齐的复合指标的原理性方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感，新提出的指标能够更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进单目深度估计评估的新指标和工具，解决了现有评估方法的不足，为更准确的深度估计评估提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in

Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人和计算机视觉中的下游任务提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision

second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in
fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical
imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and
time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure
reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance
segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of
stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually
annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy,
exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and
predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell
length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of
the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a
valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research,
reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise
quantification of neuron morphology.

TL;DR: 提出一种上下文感知的半监督框架，通过元学习从少量演示生成专家特定嵌入，解决学习延迟（L2D）系统中的数据稀缺问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际部署学习延迟系统时面临的关键数据稀缺问题，使自适应L2D系统更加实用和可扩展

Method: 使用元学习生成专家特定嵌入的双重用途机制：首先生成大量伪标签用于训练，然后在测试时实现对新专家的即时适应

Conclusion: 通过解决关键训练瓶颈，这项工作使自适应L2D系统更加实用，为现实环境中的人机协作铺平了道路

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate
reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main
text, we provide our source code and training configurations at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中提出了一种端到端架构，从瑞士德语手语视频到德语文本的翻译。系统结合了时空特征学习和翻译任务，但在测试集上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译系统通常使用序列到序列架构，但标准方法往往无法充分利用时间特征。作者希望开发一个能够同时学习时空特征表示和翻译的单一模型，实现真正的端到端架构，以更好地泛化到新数据集。

Method: 提出了一种端到端架构，该架构在一个模型中学习手语视频的时空特征表示和翻译任务，而不是使用预定义的特征提取方法。

Result: 在开发集上获得了5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 虽然端到端架构在开发集上表现良好，但在测试集上泛化能力不足，表明该方法需要进一步改进以提高稳健性。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一种基于Transformer的架构和训练方法，用于处理记忆密集型、长序列的强化学习任务，通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，相比传统长上下文Transformer更高效且泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的具身智能体在处理视觉输入时容易超出上下文限制，而人类能够利用压缩记忆来维持长期环境感知。现有方法要么使用固定大小的循环记忆，要么完全依赖完整上下文，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在训练过程中将周期性总结标记与模型输入交错排列，实现记忆的创建和检索。这种方法允许模型在长序列任务中有效管理记忆。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内多目标导航任务上，Memo优于简单的长上下文Transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高。Memo在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo通过创新的记忆机制成功解决了长序列强化学习任务中的上下文限制问题，为具身智能体在长期操作中的记忆管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

### [85] [MetaCluster: Enabling Deep Compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19105)
*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习和聚类技术，将KANs的参数存储量减少高达80倍而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 虽然提高了表达能力和准确性，但由于将标量权重替换为每边基系数向量，导致参数和内存呈乘性增长。需要一种方法在不牺牲精度的情况下实现高度压缩。

Method: 提出MetaCluster框架：1）使用轻量级元学习器与KAN联合训练，将低维嵌入映射到系数向量；2）在系数空间运行K-means聚类，用共享质心替换每边向量；3）丢弃元学习器，通过微调质心码本恢复精度损失。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，对标准KANs和ConvKANs使用多种基函数，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功利用了KAN参数的向量性质，通过跨多个系数分摊存储，实现了高效压缩，为KANs的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 本研究通过应用深度学习和数据插补技术增强了两栖动物物种分布模型（SDM）的准确性，使用数据平衡和特征选择显著提高了模型性能，多模态集成模型在蛙类计数和栖息地分类任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物种分布监测方法覆盖范围有限且不完整，需要更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测方法。物种分布建模（SDM）有助于填补这些空白，但数据稀疏或不完整时效果受限。

Method: 使用深度学习结合数据插补技术，应用数据平衡和特征选择方法，构建多模态集成模型整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量，融合图像和表格数据。

Result: 数据平衡使MAE从189降至29；多模态模型在蛙类计数和栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC；特征选择确定了关键环境因素。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著改善生态预测建模，为更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测做出贡献。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.
