While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds\nwatermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility.

It also allows users to embed\nunique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on\npost-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an\nensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of\nattack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains\nto investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the\nwatermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack\nnetwork in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the\nfrequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.\nExtensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the\nmetric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances\nthe robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests.

Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding.

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it\ndifficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically\nevolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic\nconditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general\nframework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the\ndiffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the\ndiffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by\nthe same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their\nstatistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and\nreduce the difficulty of network learning.

While deep learning has shown excellent\nperformance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and\nchange moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be\ninferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,\nnamed CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure\nconsistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers\nchange area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time\nseries analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key\nsteps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,\nand Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference\nExtraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking\nis designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features.

To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further\nenhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised\ncontrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations\nwithin crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\ncross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several\ndatasets.

The widespread use of\nopen-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the\nseverity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and\ndetection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially\nproblematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.\nIn this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military\nobject detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To\nsupport this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military\nvehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of\nmethods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a\nsimple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method.

The model leverages\ncomplementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and\nintroduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass\nFusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the\nmodel proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,\nand finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and\nupsampling.

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively\ndetect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level\ninformation. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel\ncorrespondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering\npixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D\nrepresentation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects\nthe inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose\nPointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing\nexplicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal\nspatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry\ninformation to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To\nsimultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes\nhierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit\nanomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the\nrendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy\ncontrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between\nthe rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.\nFinally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the\ngeneralized anomaly semantics.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.

In\nrecent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have\nemerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first\nsystematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic\nmanipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and\ndelineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,\nencompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of\nintegration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning\nfrom execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this\nfoundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:\n(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,\ntraining-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model\nintegration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating\narchitectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks\nthat support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,\nincluding memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent\ncooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent\nadvances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research\nfragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of\nstudies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.\n1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate\nclass balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic\ndata. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong\nperformance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving\nslightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.\nSynthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the\norganizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an\nout-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4\npercent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy.

Our framework is based on two key\nstrategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental\nSelection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general\nweather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing\ndiverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base\nmodel. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under\nchallenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and\nprediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the\nmodel to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across\ndatasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness.

However, the emergence of\nincreasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as\nDINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training\nremains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we\nsystematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image\napplications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and\nRETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and\nsystemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and\nlinear probing.

For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53d8\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u9053\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u9053\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002SAM-LLM\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6a2a\u5411\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff08SAM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "SAM-LLM\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.73%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1180%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM-LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose Robult, a scalable framework\ndesigned to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific\ninformation and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic\napproach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled\n(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while\neffectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)\na latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information\nis retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance\nperformance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete\nmodalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets\nvalidate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in\nboth semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts.
