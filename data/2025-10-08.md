TL;DR: 提出E-FPN框架用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制实现高效缺陷检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施检查中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，以及现有深度学习模型无法用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的局限性

Method: 使用增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)，包含自适应编码器、原型学习和注意力机制三个主要贡献：1) InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积的多尺度特征提取；2) 掩码平均池化的原型学习；3) 全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力的注意力特征表示

Result: 在基础设施检查数据集上取得优异性能，最佳配置为8-way 5-shot训练，在2-way分类测试中获得82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来最大性能提升

Conclusion: 该框架能够快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，仅需有限的新训练数据，为关键基础设施系统提供更高效经济的维护方案

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记（rPPG）方法，通过优先选择皮肤区域来增强信号质量，并在具有挑战性的条件下保持心率预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程光电容积描记（rPPG）是一种低成本、非接触式的心率和生命体征监测方法，但对光照和运动敏感。在无监督流程中，需要从视频中选择皮肤区域来提取rPPG信号。现有方法在真实世界条件下（如说话和头部旋转）表现不佳。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的区域（如嘴、眼睛和头发）。该方法在公开数据集上进行了评估，并提出了一个新的SYNC-rPPG数据集以更好地代表真实世界条件。

Result: 该模型在具有挑战性的条件（如说话和头部旋转）下表现出优先捕捉心跳的能力，并保持了预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差（MAE），而其他方法无法做到。此外，在检测各种肤色方面表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 该技术为真实世界应用提供了一个有前景的选择，特别是在运动条件下和不同肤色人群中的心率监测。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，将传统显微镜改造成低成本数字病理扫描系统，显著降低对焦时间和成本，同时保持诊断准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂的问题，克服现有低成本方案在自动对焦方面的局限性，包括传统方法耗时、深度学习需要多张输入或缺乏泛化能力

Method: 开发DeepAf自动对焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦距的距离并调整控制参数

Result: 对焦时间比基于堆栈的方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，与双图像方法相当但输入要求减半，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中达到0.90 AUC的癌症分类准确率

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个全面的硬件-软件设计，能够在资源受限的环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理，同时保持诊断准确性

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了动态引导方法，通过选择性锐化分数函数来减少扩散模型中的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成令人印象深刻的样本，但经常产生具有结构不一致性的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。这种幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，通过仅在已知会导致伪影的预定方向上选择性锐化分数函数来缓解幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉的方法。

Result: 动态引导在受控和自然图像数据集上都显著减少了幻觉，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态引导提供了一种细致的方法来解决扩散模型中的幻觉问题，能够在减少伪影的同时保持生成多样性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略，在保持加速收益的同时显著降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于缓存的加速方法在扩散模型推理的去噪和解码阶段会导致显著的内存激增，这限制了加速方法的实际应用效果。

Method: 1) 异步缓存交换 2) 特征分块 3) 切片潜在变量解码。这些策略针对不同推理阶段的特点进行优化，确保引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache通过阶段特定的内存优化策略，在保持视频生成质量的同时有效解决了缓存加速方法中的内存激增问题，为训练免费的扩散模型加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的时间反向重建框架，利用RGB和热成像配对图像来恢复几秒前的场景状态，通过视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义和结构一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能够捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消退的印记可以作为被动时间编码，推断超出RGB相机能力的近期事件，在法医学和场景分析中有应用潜力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明能够重建最多120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反向成像迈出第一步。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹中恢复过去场景状态的可行性，为时间反向成像技术提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过训练映射网络将图像中的对象实例嵌入转换为文本标记的方法，结合自然语言查询实现个性化图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决结合图像中特定对象实例信息和自然语言描述的复合查询进行图像检索的问题，例如检索包含特定对象（如独角兽）在特定场景（如某人头上）的图像。

Method: 设计了一个可训练的映射网络（pi-map），将对象实例的局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，然后与自然语言查询结合，使用冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器进行检索。

Result: 在两个个性化检索基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的训练过程为每个对象实例生成文本标记，有效提升了复合查询图像检索的效果。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯人头化身框架，通过2D UV特征空间参数化高斯点，实现渲染效率与视觉质量的动态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法使用固定数量的高斯点，无法满足实际应用中需要动态调整细节级别以平衡渲染效率和视觉质量的需求。

Method: 提出UV特征场和多层可学习特征图来编码高斯点的潜在特征，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图实现连续LOD控制。

Result: 在最高LOD下实现SOTA质量，最低LOD仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%，PSNR -0.97%，SSIM -0.6%，LPIPS损失+24.1%），渲染速度提升近一倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead框架成功实现了无需重新训练的连续LOD控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于3D点云视频的动作识别新方法，通过结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到了89.3%的准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法在3D点云动作识别方面表现出色，证明了结合点云特征和稀疏卷积网络的有效性，为动作识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [11] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于在扩散模型中实现更自然的数据流形感知插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量内容，但缺乏显式的低维潜在空间来参数化数据流形，这限制了流形感知的分析和操作（如插值和编辑）。现有的插值方法通常遵循高密度区域路径，但这些路径不一定与数据流形对齐，可能导致感知不自然的过渡。

Method: 基于分数函数雅可比矩阵能捕捉局部数据流形切空间的最新发现，提出了一种在噪声空间上的新颖黎曼度量。该度量鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度的方法和朴素基线产生了感知上更自然和忠实的过渡效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的黎曼度量方法能够有效利用扩散模型学习到的数据流形，实现更自然的流形感知插值操作。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [12] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork提出了一种灵活高效的统一解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，同时保持预训练扩散模型架构不变，适用于多种图形学任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对扩散模型通道扩展的解决方案往往是特定于应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务。需要一种灵活通用的方法来同时增加输入输出通道并适应新任务。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的LoRA（低秩适应）方法同时处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活和停用。

Result: Teamwork在多种生成和逆向图形学任务中表现出灵活性和高效性，包括修复、单图像SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种不改变预训练模型架构的统一通道扩展方案，能够有效适应多种图形学应用，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在批改手写数学作业方面表现不一：对于有明确答案的算术题准确率接近人类（95%），但对于需要视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图任务则表现较差，需要人类描述辅助才能达到人类间一致性水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在批改手写学生数学作业方面的潜力，特别是在小学和初中数学教育中，手工批改学生作业非常耗时，而了解学生的解题过程对教学有重要价值。

Method: 设计两个实验：实验A测试288份加纳中学生手写算术题（有客观答案）的批改能力；实验B评估150份美国小学生数学插图（无单一正确答案），分别测试模型直接批改和基于人类描述批改的表现。

Result: 实验A：模型准确率达95%（k=0.90），接近人类水平但存在人类不太可能犯的错误；实验B：直接批改插图时表现差（k=0.20），但基于人类描述后一致性显著提升至k=0.47，达到人类间一致性水平。

Conclusion: MLLM能够较好地"看到"和解释算术作业，但在"看到"学生数学插图方面仍有困难，视觉理解能力存在局限性，需要人类描述辅助才能达到有效教学评估水平。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，首次能够仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的强视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到这一领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要专注于获取识别或运动的丰富表示，而不是同时处理两者。虽然潜在动态建模已在决策制定中用于学习观察的潜在表示及其随时间的变化，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习领域。

Method: Midway Network采用中间自上而下路径来推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，使用密集前向预测目标和分层结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多物体场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。通过基于前向特征扰动的新颖分析方法，还展示了其学习到的动态能够捕捉高级对应关系。

Conclusion: Midway Network成功地将潜在动态建模应用于视觉表示学习，首次实现了仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的强表示，为多模态感知任务提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

TL;DR: HoloScene是一个新颖的交互式3D重建框架，通过基于能量的优化方法同时实现几何完整性、对象交互性、物理合理性和真实感渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、对象交互性、物理合理性、真实感渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，通过采样探索和梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的真实感渲染。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互式游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展示了广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过校准视觉和文本空间中的主导令牌来改善文本驱动图像检索任务中VLMs的结构限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器(CVE)，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间提出判别概念校准器(DCC)，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念，改善判别概念的表示。

Result: 在三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试上均取得了一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效解决了VLMs在文本驱动图像检索中的结构限制问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉推理中的冗余，将提示推理长度减少54%的同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于思维链的自动回归多模态大语言模型在图像生成中存在视觉过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和细节矛盾

Method: 引入自适应奖励函数，根据任务难度调整奖励，结合强化学习范式优化思维链推理的简洁性

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和GenEval等多个基准测试中，推理长度减少54%，质量指标保持或略有提升

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度和视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高了计算效率

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测方法依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂，而MLLM在HOI检测中的推理能力未被充分探索

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习方法训练MLLM，通过纯文本解决HOI检测任务

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，并具有很好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOI检测任务中的潜力，为简化HOI检测框架提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出轻量级控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络；引入早期中心采样策略，降低训练成本；在推理时使用温度调度补偿后期token训练不足。

Result: 在基于尺度的自回归模型上进行广泛实验，验证了该方法能够实现高保真度和多样性的图像生成控制，超越现有基线。

Conclusion: ECM框架在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率，为自回归模型在条件生成任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP是一种从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归模型因强加人工排序而无法捕捉长距离依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成模型由于对无序点集强加人工排序，导致模型过度关注局部连续性而忽视全局结构特性（如对称性、拓扑一致性等），性能一直落后于扩散模型。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，基于形状建模中的细节层次（LOD）原则，采用从粗到细的生成策略：在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化高尺度下的细粒度几何。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中实现了最先进的生成质量，并在参数、训练和推理效率方面超越了强扩散基线。在8192个点的密集生成任务中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，证明了自回归方法在点云生成中的潜力，具有出色的可扩展性。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星图像的工作流程，下游适配通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：(1)自动化数据整理将原始图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑高效模型；(3)无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Result: 在三个任务中复现数据集并训练模型，mIoU差异微小（-0.73pp至+1.79pp），蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少FLOPs和CO2排放。在作物分割任务上达到60.65% mIoU，比基线提升12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Method: 提出CHEST损失函数，包含双曲空间和欧几里得空间的代理损失，以及基于双曲层次聚类的正则化损失。通过结合两种空间来提高DML精度和学习稳定性

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估CHEST损失，实现了新的最先进性能

Conclusion: 双曲空间和欧几里得空间的结合能提高深度度量学习的准确性和学习稳定性，CHEST损失函数在多个数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位（AHP）是斜视等眼部错位引起的代偿机制，早期诊断可减少并发症。当前临床评估主观性强且医疗记录不完整，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 1. AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；2. 课程学习补全框架：逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据填补缺失值。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R²>0.93；补全框架准确率93.46-99.78%，临床依赖建模显著改善（p<0.001）。

Conclusion: 两种框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复具有有效性，为AHP的客观评估提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有教育AI方法大多关注短期或单智能体设置，难以系统研究真实课堂的复杂性（开放认知、动态社交互动、情感因素、多会话发展等），因此需要开发能够复现认知发展、群体互动和长期演化的虚拟课堂系统。

Method: 提出EduVerse系统，采用分层CIE（认知-交互-演化）架构，支持环境、智能体和会话的自定义，并包含人在环接口允许真实用户加入。系统确保个体一致性、真实互动以及认知、情感和行为的纵向适应性。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and

TL;DR: SD-MVSum方法扩展了基于脚本的视频摘要技术，通过加权跨模态注意力机制同时考虑视频视觉内容和语音内容与用户提供脚本的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脚本驱动视频摘要方法主要关注视频视觉内容与脚本的匹配，忽略了视频中语音内容的重要性。

Method: 提出SD-MVSum方法，使用加权跨模态注意力机制建模脚本-视频和脚本-转录本之间的依赖关系，利用语义相似性选择与脚本最相关的视频片段。

Result: 实验证明SD-MVSum在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，并扩展了两个大规模数据集S-VideoXum和MrHiSum。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合提升了视频摘要性能，相关代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: ARGUS是一个用于肝癌组织学分型的新方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌作为原发性肝癌的两种主要亚型，在组织形态和细胞结构上表现出极大的复杂性。现有的方法未能充分利用全切片图像中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息，导致对组织学表征的理解有限和分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS方法包含三个核心组件：1）构建微几何特征来表示细胞水平的精细模式；2）设计分层视野对齐模块来建模宏观和中观层次的相互作用；3）通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微几何和视野特征融合为联合表示。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的大量实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型方面达到了最先进的性能，为临床实践提供了有效的诊断工具。

Conclusion: ARGUS通过有效利用全切片图像中的多层次信息，显著提升了肝癌组织学分型的准确性和可靠性，在临床诊断中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的流程，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入到背景场景中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将人物真实插入背景场景的挑战，传统方法将位置确定和个性化处理视为独立问题且依赖训练，忽略了它们之间的相互联系

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保持人物身份特征

Result: 在复杂场景中实现了最先进的人物插入效果，无需特定任务训练，仅需单张参考图像即可保持人物身份、服装和身体特征

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需任务特定训练，首次实现了无需训练的真实人物插入

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像机录制自动编辑的多模态架构，将问题分解为"何时剪切"和"如何剪切"两个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍是一个未被充分探索的任务，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像机录制编辑方面存在研究空白。

Method: 1) 时序分割任务：使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道集成音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时序特征；2) 空间选择任务：采用CLIP编码器替代传统ResNet，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会的片段内。

Result: 模型在检测剪切点方面优于现有基线方法，在视觉镜头选择方面表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了多模态自动视频编辑的技术发展，为古典音乐会录制提供了有效的自动化编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究R. solani病原菌对生菜种子萌发和早期发育的影响，同时验证低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性表型数据采集的可行性。

Method: 使用多台相机连续拍摄感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了整合形态和空间特征的图像分析算法，特别采用了时空整合分析技术，即使在幼苗重叠的复杂条件下也能准确识别和量化个体幼苗。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了生菜种子的萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在幼苗计数方面表现出色，决定系数达到0.98，均方根误差为1.12，特别在实验后期传统分割技术失效时仍能准确计数。

Conclusion: 成功证明了低成本成像系统与先进计算工具结合的有效性，为植物病理学研究提供了非破坏性、可扩展的表型数据采集方法，特别是在复杂生长条件下具有显著优势。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和tokenizer的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

Method: 提出年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，利用衰老的线性特性减少对大量年龄标注数据的依赖

Result: AgeBooth能够从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量上优于现有最先进的编辑方法

Conclusion: AgeBooth是一种有效的年龄特定微调方法，无需昂贵年龄变化数据集即可增强基于适配器的身份个性化模型的年龄控制能力

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有检测器主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了跨视觉域泛化这一同等重要的挑战。需要更全面的评估方法和检测器来应对现实场景中的合成图像检测问题。

Method: 开发了FusionDetect方法，结合CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型的优势，构建统一特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还建立了新的基准和框架，为通用AI图像检测的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行特征学习。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到新SOTA，性能甚至超过使用真实2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法2.53%（50.95% vs 48.42% mAP）。

Conclusion: ALISE框架成功实现了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割，证明了无监督方法可以超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构，但查询图像和产品在不同阶段的表示差异导致难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）构建端到端生成框架，采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持强视觉相似性先验的同时有效融入用户特定信息。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 当前大多数OOD检测方法仅使用预训练模型的最终层表示，忽略了中间层可能包含的丰富分布偏移信号。本文旨在挑战这种传统做法。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则自动识别在训练免费设置下提供最互补信息的中间层，选择性地整合这些中间层表示来改进OOD检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了利用预训练模型中间层进行OOD检测的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于栅格化的优化策略，结合栅格化高斯核渲染的高效性和Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制，显著加速二维图像回归任务，同时保持模型稀疏性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用栅格化优化策略替代全局迭代优化，结合栅格化高斯核渲染和边缘感知门控机制，实现更快的参数更新和更内存高效的模型表示。

Result: 该方法实现了显著加速的参数更新，支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用，在计算效率和重建保真度之间取得了新的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为二维图像处理任务提供了计算效率和重建质量之间的优化平衡，扩展了栅格化方法的应用范围。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法来检测心脏磁共振图像中的五个关键帧，相比传统基于心室容积的方法在ED和ES检测准确率上提升30%-51%（SAX视图）和11%-47%（4CH视图）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入分析心肌运动模式。个体心脏周期的差异使得自动时间比较或亚相位分析变得复杂。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中基于简单规则确定关键帧。在三个公开多中心多疾病数据集上进行独立评估。

Result: SAX视图平均循环帧差低于1.31帧，LAX视图低于1.73帧。能够检测ED、ES以及三个额外关键帧，实现不依赖周期或相位长度的时空对齐分析。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了改进的关键帧检测精度，支持跨患者和患者内部的心脏动力学时空对齐分析，对罕见先天性心脏病患者也具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强基于LLM的长视频理解的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动令牌剪枝减少视频冗余，在多个视频理解基准上取得领先性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP语义先验，缺乏对运动信息的有效利用

Method: 提出Temporal Granularity Optimization和Motion Token Pruning两个核心模块：TGO利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似内容，再用语义先验过滤无关信息；MTP利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频令牌

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME 64.7%、MLVU 71.4%、LongVideoBench 60.4%

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余问题，为基于LLM的长视频理解提供了新思路

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: acia-workflows为活细胞成像分析提供了可访问、可复现且可扩展的工作流平台，支持生物研究的常规应用

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫复杂特征、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等挑战，该任务仍然困难。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用神经架构搜索自动学习每个细胞内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略联合更新网络权重和架构参数，使用零操作去除不重要连接。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别优于最先进的迁移学习、Transformer、AutoML和NAS方法约16%、10%和8%。在Insects-1M数据集上获得93.25%准确率、93.71%精确率、92.74%召回率和93.22% F1分数。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>

Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成领域取得突破，但与传统GAN或扩散模型不同，其通过离散token预测生成图像，具有独特的量化表示特征，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D3QE)方法，通过动态码本频率统计的注意力机制，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示来检测自回归生成图像。

Result: 在包含7种主流视觉自回归模型的ARForensics数据集上实验表明，D3QE具有优异的检测准确率和强泛化能力，对真实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D3QE方法有效利用了自回归模型生成图像的独特特征，为自回归生成图像的检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

TL;DR: WS-ICL是一种新的医学图像分割上下文学习范式，使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标注，显著降低标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习模型）虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要对每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签。为解决这些问题，提出了WS-ICL。

Method: 提出弱监督上下文学习（WS-ICL）范式，利用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，而不是密集标签。这种方法消除了对细粒度掩码和所有图像重复用户提示的需求。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试上的实验结果表明，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的同时，实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能。WS-ICL在交互式范式下也表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效、统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的大规模物流缺陷检测数据集，该数据集比现有基准大40倍，包含超过23万张图像和2.9万个缺陷实例，展示了在零售物流场景下现有异常检测方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测基准（如MVTec-AD和VisA）已达到饱和状态，SOTA方法能获得99.9%的AUROC分数，但这些方法主要针对制造场景，无法应对零售物流中物体姿态和外观的多样性挑战。

Method: 构建了一个包含超过230,000张图像（29,000+缺陷实例）的大规模数据集，涵盖48,000+个不同物体，并对多种SOTA异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最优方法在该数据集上的AUROC不超过56.96%，远低于在制造场景中的表现，定性分析证实现有方法难以在剧烈姿态和外观变化下有效利用正常样本。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题，数据集已公开提供下载。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对医学影像中的token mixer进行系统研究，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制在不同医学影像任务中的表现，发现分类任务中低复杂度token mixer足够，而分割任务需要卷积的局部归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在自然图像领域已得到广泛研究，但在医学影像中的应用仍较少，且缺乏对不同token mixer的系统比较，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构下系统分析了池化、卷积和注意力三类token mixer，在8个医学影像数据集上评估图像分类和语义分割任务，并研究了从自然图像预训练权重迁移的效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）足够有效，预训练权重对新的token mixer仍有帮助；分割任务中卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积是优选方案。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务对token mixer的需求与自然图像不同，分类任务注重效率，分割任务需要局部特征建模，分组卷积在保持性能的同时能显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA在视频去噪中的有效性，展示了在增强微弱目标信噪比和分离逆合成孔径雷达图像中自行车与风杂波的应用效果

Conclusion: DMCA方法能够有效处理视频的动态内容变化，在多个应用场景中表现出色，为视频分析提供了新的自适应表示框架

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，传统的鲁棒水印方案面临新的威胁。本研究旨在探索扩散模型对现有水印技术的破坏能力。

Method: 提出了一种扩散驱动的图像再生过程，并引入了一种新颖的引导扩散攻击方法，该方法在生成过程中明确针对水印信号。理论上证明了当图像经过足够的基于扩散的变换后，水印图像与嵌入水印载荷之间的互信息会消失。

Result: 在多个最先进的水印方案（包括StegaStamp、TrustMark和VINE等深度学习方法）上进行实验评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性脆弱性，强调了在生成式AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可测量冰雹直径，两阶段提示比单阶段提示更可靠，最佳模型平均绝对误差1.12cm

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，实现了更好的语义对齐和遗忘缓解

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在分析监控录像时具有意外出现的识别特定个体的能力，即使训练数据不含人类主体。研究评估了两种技术防护措施来限制模型的人员再识别能力，但发现存在漏洞，提出了AI治理和数据保护方面的监管问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究揭示通用实例搜索模型存在意外出现的人员识别能力，这引发了基于个人数据进行身份识别和画像的担忧，但目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失。通过实验结合这两种方法，测试其在限制人员再识别能力同时保持非人物体检索性能的效果。

Result: 结合索引排除和混淆损失可以将人员再识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但发现防护措施存在关键漏洞，包括使用部分人物图像可能绕过防护。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了AI治理和数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有突发识别能力的系统？以及需要什么技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时面临冗余信息干扰和关键帧识别困难两个挑战，需要一种能够动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧的解决方案。

Method: 提出VideoMiner方法：1）迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构；2）引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，专门针对树结构设计，整合事件级时空信息。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优异性能，模型意外地自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习的结合，有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态大语言模型的长视频理解提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型限制了表示能力，而基于优化的方法计算成本高。需要一种既能表达灵活几何结构又高效的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化和动态预测3D关键点的全局结构引导，通过相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点。

Result: 在单视角设置下达到最先进性能，在多视角场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD无需密集3D监督即可实现表达性强且适应性强的几何重建，在计算效率和重建质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Motivation: 传统基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临视觉输入维度高、奖励稀疏、从原始视觉数据提取任务相关特征困难等挑战。

Method: 将医学领域专用的Vision-Language模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，每轮任务处理一次观测和指令生成高级规划标记，将医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈高效结合。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO相比标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线表现更好、收敛更快，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，提升幅度达66.67%至1114.29%。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明了医学专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中的重要性，为视觉强化学习在医疗领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类和机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业模型在解决高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准测试，包含七类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注；提出五个推理导向的评估指标；开发基于代理的视觉语言模型框架来利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 该方法在五种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到83.9%的平均解决准确率，显著超越现有基线模型（约21.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT解释方法主要依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声地图；注意力机制本身是有价值的可解释信号，只需适当过滤

Method: 将注意力地图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声模式，并扩展了类特定变体以生成判别性解释

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法能生成更清晰、更可解释的地图，在扰动保真度指标和人类注视数据对齐方面优于或与SOTA方法相当

Conclusion: 该方法高效且符合人类认知，证明注意力机制经过适当过滤后仍然是ViT解释的有价值工具

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

Motivation: 当前临床决策中使用的生存分析模型往往难以解释，降低了其在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽略了更广泛的肿瘤背景，缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 1) 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局/局部特征和基因组数据；2) 稳健的表型表示，将关键图像块与全局背景融合；3) 指数原型更新策略(EMA ProtoUp)维持稳定的跨模态关联；4) 分层原型匹配方案捕获全局中心性、局部典型性和队列级趋势。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用的原型学习提供了新视角，实现了可追踪和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced

consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，证明了跨模态统一生成在医学领域的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将指代视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过预训练T2V模型实现细粒度像素控制和时序一致性，在多个基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RVOS方法采用'定位-分割'的级联设计存在信息瓶颈和时序不一致问题，需要克服这些根本限制。

Method: 提出FlowRVS框架，将RVOS建模为条件连续流问题，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导变形过程，而不是传统的从噪声生成掩码或直接预测掩码。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的SOTA：MeViS数据集上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提升1.6），Ref-DAVIS17零样本测试中达到73.3（提升2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的一阶段生成方法展示了这一方向的优势。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

Motivation: 视频条件下的4D形状生成旨在从输入视频中恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视图一致的外观，需要解决时间一致性和动态表示的问题

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入了三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，以增强时间稳定性

Result: 方法能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，在多样化野外视频中提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式

Conclusion: 该框架为视频到4D形状生成提供了一种有效的端到端解决方案，在时间一致性和动态表示方面优于基线方法

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以整合精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法实现可控的镜头模糊效果

Method: 采用全焦点图像生成、单目深度估计、焦点距离变换器预测焦点距离，然后使用可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像，通过梯度反向传播实现无监督学习

Result: 实验结果表明该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的精细控制

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到图像生成提供了精确的交互式散焦效果控制能力，超越了现有扩散模型

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一种实时单目SLAM系统，无需深度传感器即可达到RGB-D级别的精度，通过三个预训练视觉模块替代主动深度输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，这标志着向更简单和更具成本效益的SLAM系统迈进一步。

Method: 系统使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习的关键点检测器和实例分割网络。通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态对象，将静态关键点分配预测深度值并反投影到3D空间形成度量缩放特征，然后由未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端进行处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，DropD-SLAM在静态序列上达到7.4厘米平均ATE，在动态序列上达到1.8厘米，匹配或超越了最先进的RGB-D方法，同时在单个GPU上以22 FPS运行。

Conclusion: 结果表明预训练视觉模型可以有效地替代主动深度传感器，为构建更简单、更具成本效益的SLAM系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个针对夜间第一人称视角视觉的综合基准测试，核心任务是视觉问答（VQA），通过昼夜对齐视频揭示光照条件差异带来的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补夜间视觉理解的研究空白。

Method: 收集合成视频（Blender渲染）和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐。构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强夜间自动标注引擎，并通过人工验证确保质量。

Result: 构建了包含3658个QA对、90个视频、12种QA类型的数据集。评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在从白天转移到夜间时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视角视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照领域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的单阶段前馈框架，用于从单目视频中实时重建4D人体-场景，无需多阶段流程或迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代接触感知优化和大量预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM），导致效率低下且复杂。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优，在单次前向传播中联合恢复全局多人SMPL-X人体、稠密3D场景和相机轨迹。

Result: 在单个GPU上训练一天后，实现实时速度（15 FPS）和低内存占用（8 GB），在多项任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线，有望促进下游应用的发展，展示了统一模型在4D人体-场景重建中的潜力。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络（SNN）的二次积分发放（QIF）神经元模型离散化方法，解决了传统LIF神经元表达能力有限和QIF模型训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限（仅限于线性衰减），而更复杂的QIF神经元具有丰富的非线性动力学特性但训练不稳定，限制了其在深度SNN中的应用。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，并推导了基于离散化参数集的代理梯度窗口分析公式，以最小化梯度失配，确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够超越最先进的基于LIF的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的QIF神经元离散化方法为深度SNN提供了一种有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化强制两个输出分布过度均匀优化，限制了对抗训练的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 加权对抗互正则化：提出分解的对抗互KL散度损失，允许通过为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重来灵活控制优化过程。2. 对抗泛化正则化：在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布，提高泛化能力和模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的方法相比现有基于正则化的方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门针对对抗训练的正则化策略，有效提升了对抗训练的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

TL;DR: NEO是一种无需超参数、计算成本极低的测试时自适应方法，通过在潜在空间中对目标数据嵌入进行重中心化，显著提升分布偏移下的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在计算成本高、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感的问题。基于潜在空间几何理论，发现将目标数据嵌入重中心化到原点可以显著改善源域和分布偏移样本之间的对齐。

Method: 提出NEO方法，该方法无需超参数调优，仅需对目标数据嵌入进行重中心化操作，计算成本与标准推理相当。方法基于潜在空间几何理论，通过简单的嵌入中心化实现有效的领域自适应。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上，ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升至59.2%（仅使用64个样本批次）。在512个样本上，NEO在ImageNet-C、ImageNet-R和ImageNet-S上优于所有7种对比方法，在CIFAR-10-C上优于6/7方法。在Raspberry Pi和Jetson Orin Nano设备上，推理时间减少63%，内存使用降低9%。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于多种ViT架构和数据集，在资源受限环境中具有显著优势，且能够从少量类别的适应中泛化到其他类别。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过邻域自适应学习和多模式挖掘机制，有效解决了传统图嵌入方法的局限性，在不同应用场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整的SGD轨迹作为监督信号，但这些轨迹噪声大、曲率高、存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛缓慢和内存开销大。

Method: 使用连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线作为平滑、低损失的参数化替代路径，替代完整的SGD轨迹，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上超越最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持临床有效的模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接路径作为SGD路径的有效替代，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: JEPA模型不仅能够学习下游任务的表示，其反坍塌项实际上还能估计数据密度，从而可以用于数据筛选、异常检测等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示JEPA模型中反坍塌项的深层作用，证明其能够估计数据密度，扩展JEPA的应用范围。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPA的反坍塌项可以估计数据密度，并提出JEPA-SCORE方法利用模型的Jacobian矩阵高效计算样本概率。

Result: 在合成数据、控制数据集和Imagenet等数据集上验证了JEPA-SCORE的有效性，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2和MetaCLIP等多种模型。

Conclusion: JEPA模型不仅具有表示学习能力，还能提供数据密度估计，为数据管理和分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了nnsam2方法，用于腰椎旁肌肉的少样本分割，只需每个数据集单个标注切片即可实现多模态MRI和CT的准确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分割方法需要大量标注数据的问题，开发一种只需极少量标注（每个数据集仅一个标注切片）就能实现多模态腰椎旁肌肉准确分割的高效方法。

Method: 使用nnsam2框架，基于单个切片SAM2提示生成伪标签，通过跨数据集池化和三个顺序独立的nnU-Net模型进行细化。在6个数据集1219个扫描（19439个切片）上验证，仅使用6个标注切片。

Result: nnsam2在MR图像上DSC达到0.94-0.96，CT上达到0.92-0.93，优于现有方法。自动测量与专家测量在肌肉体积、脂肪比例和CT衰减值上统计等效，ICC高达0.86-1.00。

Conclusion: nnsam2是用于多模态LPM分割的最先进少样本框架，具有高标注效率、强泛化能力和可重复性，已开源代码和数据。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate No-New SAM2 (nnsam2) for few-shot
segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles using only a single annotated slice
per dataset, and to assess its statistical comparability with expert
measurements across multi-sequence MRI and multi-protocol CT.
  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,219 scans (19,439 slices) from 762
participants across six datasets. Six slices (one per dataset) served as
labeled examples, while the remaining 19,433 slices were used for testing. In
this minimal-supervision setting, nnsam2 used single-slice SAM2 prompts to
generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through
three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and automated
measurements-including muscle volume, fat ratio, and CT attenuation-were
assessed with two one-sided tests (TOST) and intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC).
  Results: nnsam2 outperformed vanilla SAM2, its medical variants,
TotalSegmentator, and the leading few-shot method, achieving DSCs of 0.94-0.96
on MR images and 0.92-0.93 on CT. Automated and expert measurements were
statistically equivalent for muscle volume (MRI/CT), CT attenuation, and Dixon
fat ratio (TOST, P < 0.05), with consistently high ICCs (0.86-1.00).
  Conclusion: We developed nnsam2, a state-of-the-art few-shot framework for
multi-modality LPM segmentation, producing muscle volume (MRI/CT), attenuation
(CT), and fat ratio (Dixon MRI) measurements that were statistically comparable
to expert references. Validated across multimodal, multicenter, and
multinational cohorts, and released with open code and data, nnsam2
demonstrated high annotation efficiency, robust generalizability, and
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能手机上可见光谱虹膜识别面临的挑战，包括光照变化、色素差异和缺乏标准化采集控制等问题。

Method: 开发了自定义Android应用进行实时取景和质量评估，构建CUVIRIS数据集，设计轻量级MobileNetV3多任务分割网络LightIrisNet和适配VIS域的Transformer匹配器IrisFormer。

Result: OSIRIS在FAR=0.01时达到97.9%的TAR（EER=0.76%），IrisFormer在CUVIRIS上仅使用UBIRIS.v2训练就达到0.057%的EER。

Conclusion: 标准化采集和VIS适配的轻量级模型能够在智能手机上实现准确实用的虹膜识别。

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains
difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the
absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact
end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at
acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on
commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time
framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset
of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based
multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient
on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the
VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against
prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%),
while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on
CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the
dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that
standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and
practical iris recognition on smartphones.

Motivation: 透明物体操作研究目前局限于短时程任务和基本抓取能力，现有方法在新物体泛化性和精确长时程操作方面存在不足。

Method: 提出DeLTa框架，整合深度估计、6D姿态估计和视觉语言规划，采用单次演示方法将6D轨迹泛化到新透明物体，无需类别先验或额外训练。

Result: 综合评估显示该方法在长时程场景中显著优于现有透明物体操作方法，特别是在需要精确操作能力的任务上。

Conclusion: DeLTa框架成功解决了透明物体长时程精确操作的挑战，通过演示和语言引导实现了对新物体的有效泛化。

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

TL;DR: UniDoc-Bench是首个大规模、真实的MM-RAG基准测试，基于7万真实PDF页面构建，支持多模态检索增强生成的标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态检索增强生成的评估存在碎片化问题，要么只关注文本或图像，要么采用简化的多模态设置，无法捕捉文档中心的多模态使用场景。

Method: 从8个领域的7万真实PDF页面提取并链接文本、表格和图像证据，生成1600个多模态QA对，涵盖事实检索、比较、总结和逻辑推理查询，其中20%经过多标注者验证和专家裁决。

Result: 实验表明，多模态文本图像融合RAG系统始终优于单模态和联合多模态嵌入检索，证明仅文本或图像都不足够，当前多模态嵌入仍不充分。

Conclusion: 该基准不仅支持标准化评估，还揭示了视觉上下文何时以及如何补充文本证据，发现了系统性失败模式，并为开发更稳健的MM-RAG管道提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图片描述自动化评估方法忽视了视觉叙事路径（描述元素的顺序和位置），而现有的空间语义特征分析需要手动标记或基于词典的映射，工作量大

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，从Cookie Theft图片描述中自动提取和排序CIU，采用5折交叉验证评估

Result: 在CIU检测中达到93%的中位精度和96%的中位召回率，序列错误率为24%，提取的特征与真实值有强相关性，在外部验证中优于基于词典的基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MMLNet的新型多模态假新闻检测方法，专门解决现实应用中模态不完整问题，通过多专家协作推理、不完整模态适配器和模态缺失学习三个关键步骤实现鲁棒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态新闻在传播过程中可能丢失某些信息，导致模态不完整，这会损害现有模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: MMLNet包含三个关键步骤：(1)多专家协作推理通过多个专家动态利用互补信息来补偿缺失模态；(2)不完整模态适配器利用新的特征分布来补偿缺失信息；(3)模态缺失学习采用标签感知自适应加权策略和对比学习来学习鲁棒表示。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准数据集上评估，涵盖两种语言，相比最先进方法展现出优越性能，同时保持相对简单性。

Conclusion: MMLNet通过确保在信息传播导致的不完整模态场景下假新闻检测的准确性，有效遏制了恶意虚假信息的传播。

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the
emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous
studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn
discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world
applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during
dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to
the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a
novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert
Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.
It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to
compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary
information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters
compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature
distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive
weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.
We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news
detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation,
MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

Method: 提出扩散模型，引入基于完整360度空间的三重条件信号：全景显著性图识别兴趣区域，边界框感知有符号距离图定义目标视角，以及整个场景的描述性标题

Result: 模型生成的空间感知视角视频和音频能够被更广泛的、不可见的环境上下文连贯地影响，证明了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为现实和沉浸式音视频生成引入了重要的可控性，填补了该领域的空白

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the
advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the
fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger,
immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of
audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable
audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we
propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals
derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify
regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the
target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating
these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios
that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context,
introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and
immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the
effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: FMT在深度重建中面临精度挑战，传统迭代方法z分辨率差，监督学习方法需要大量高质量配对训练数据，但在实践中难以获取。需要找到有效结合学习方法和迭代方案的途径。

Method: 提出WB-IPM方法，建立理论基础，使用仅依赖于地面真实值与神经网络输出之间方向分量的较弱损失函数，大幅减少训练工作量。

Result: 该方法比基于学习和基于迭代的方法实现了更准确的重建，通过误差分析和模拟及真实数据实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: WB-IPM为FMT深度重建提供了一种更准确、稳定的解决方案，显著降低了训练要求，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical
imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant
accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods
struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised
learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large,
high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in
practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches
can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and
stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative
projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The
method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the
learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker
loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference
between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing
the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well
as simulated and real-data experiments.

Motivation: 现有的单信号模型基奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，难以捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 提出混合奖励建模框架，整合模型基奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则基奖励（领域特定启发式提供显式正确性信号），并引入多方面奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B参数规模模型上，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 该框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法，在多模态基准测试中表现出持续改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and

Motivation: 视频对齐音频生成是一个相对未被充分探索的领域，现有方法主要关注时间同步，但缺乏空间感知能力。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型提取深度图和边界框的空间线索，作为扩散模型中的交叉注意力条件，生成与视频时空对齐的立体声。

Result: 在Walking The Maps数据集上的实验表明，StereoSync能够实现时间和空间对齐，显著提升了音频生成的沉浸感和真实感。

Conclusion: StereoSync通过引入空间感知能力，在视频到音频生成领域取得了显著进展，创造了更加沉浸和真实的音频体验。

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years,
video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier.
To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model
designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a
reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover,
StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models,
reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality
synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal
synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by
incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed,
given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and
bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based
audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple
synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial
structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The
Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature
animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial
alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and
resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频到音频生成中的语义对齐问题，提升生成音频与视频内容的语义一致性

Method: 使用Gramian表示对齐度量(GRAM)对齐视频、文本和音频模态的嵌入，结合基于扩散的音频合成模型和波形包络条件

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio
generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned
multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio
generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure
(GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling
precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of
FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on
GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness
and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate
FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio
models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using
GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with
video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir
computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the
reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing
(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked
activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous
stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a
subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural
responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature
space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification
using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the
biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural
activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the
performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a
standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate
that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,
highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational
substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of
integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the
goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can
inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Vision Transformer架构，结合CNN和SE模块，用于从心电图图像中识别情绪状态，在两个数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在生物医学信号的情绪识别方面存在局限性，而先进的Transformer架构有望超越传统机器学习和深度学习方法，为情绪状态提供更准确的生理基础分析。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过连续小波变换和功率谱密度分析对ECG信号进行预处理并转换为图像；然后提出结合CNN和SE模块的增强版Vision Transformer架构来处理情绪识别挑战。

Result: 在YAAD数据集上，该方法在七种情绪状态分类以及效价和唤醒度分类方面超越了现有最先进方法；在DREAMER数据集上，在效价、唤醒度和支配度区分方面也表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的改进Vision Transformer架构在ECG情绪识别任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性和创新性，为基于生物医学信号的情绪分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the
human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper
understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and
feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability
linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system
activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our
emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional
approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which
surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by
assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model
in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following
this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN
and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with
emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply
advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting
signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power
spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision
transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network
components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our
methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data
from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the
YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in
classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal
classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in
distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current
leading techniques.

TL;DR: OASIS提出了一种新的分割回归框架，通过加权损失函数优先处理对象重叠区域，显著改善了重叠物体像素强度和拓扑特征的提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学成像中重叠物体分离的挑战，特别是在重叠区域像素归属最模糊的情况下，现有深度学习方法通常对所有区域同等对待，无法优先处理重叠区域。

Method: 开发了OASIS分割回归框架，采用加权损失函数在训练过程中优先处理对象重叠区域，从而能够从严重遮挡的物体中提取像素强度和拓扑特征。

Result: 相比未加权训练，OASIS将低能电子径迹（4-5 keV）的中值强度重建误差从-32%改善到-14%，拓扑交并比得分从0.828提高到0.855。

Conclusion: OASIS证明了在重叠主导区域恢复被遮挡信号的能力，为科学成像提供了一种通用方法，特别是在像素代表物理量且重叠遮挡感兴趣特征的情况下。

Abstract: The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in
scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can
predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather
than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent
advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap
in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of
overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We
address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new
segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to
prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of
pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We
demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to
directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is
induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection
chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for
reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried
within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to
unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from
-32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological
intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains
demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated
regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific
imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures
features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain
adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型容易受到对抗性提示攻击，现有防御策略难以在保持实用性的同时实现鲁棒性。研究发现[EOS]令牌在良性提示和对抗性提示的嵌入空间中表现出不同的分布模式，这为开发新的防御方法提供了机会。

Result: SafeGuider在各种攻击场景下最大攻击成功率仅为5.48%，显著优于现有方法。对于不安全提示，框架不会拒绝生成或产生黑图，而是生成安全且有意义的图像，提高了实用性。

Conclusion: SafeGuider为安全文本到图像系统的实际部署提供了有效解决方案，展示了在不同架构间的适应性和多功能性，有望推动安全生成模型的实际应用。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures
and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving
robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world
applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first
conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)
model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our
findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting
distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its
embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a
two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising
generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model
with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration
enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign
prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain
attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack
success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack
scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images
for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,
enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the
SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as
the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different
architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical
deployment of secure text-to-image systems.
