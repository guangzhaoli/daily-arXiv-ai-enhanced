Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT-Batten是一个基于少量样本的Vision Transformer框架，用于从儿童脑部MRI中检测早期Batten病，通过知识蒸馏和度量学习实现高精度诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见的儿童神经退行性疾病，其早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI解决方案。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为500万参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失和5-shot训练）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM实现可解释性预测。

Result: 在多中心数据集（79例Batten病MRI和90例年龄匹配对照）上达到约91%的准确率和AUC≥0.95，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线，敏感度>90%，特异性约90%。

Conclusion: 该模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析领域存在数据量有限和数据置信度低的挑战，现有方法在数据充足时表现良好但难以应对小数据场景

Method: TreeNet通过整合神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征，构建分层决策集成学习框架，具有可解释性和适应性

Conclusion: TreeNet在医学图像分析特别是实时分析中展现出高效性和实用性，为小数据场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B-Spline编码和多阶段残差量化技术，为VLA模型构建紧凑可迁移的动作表示，实现6.8倍的序列压缩和更快的自回归训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型中的自回归方法在处理长序列动作时效率低下，先前基于熵引导和令牌频率的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 首先通过值范围和时间范围归一化获得一致性表示，使用B-Spline编码；然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散令牌；最后开发跨具身学习策略，利用统一动作模式空间联合利用机器人和人类演示数据。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散令牌化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵；在多样化的真实机器人和仿真实验中，OmniSAT在保持重建质量的同时实现更高压缩，使AR训练收敛更快且模型性能更好。

Conclusion: OmniSAT提供了一种高效的动作表示方法，通过紧凑的离散令牌化显著提升VLA模型中自回归方法的训练效率和性能，同时支持跨具身学习。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KAMamba的新方法，用于改进MODIS时间序列的变化检测，通过知识驱动的过渡矩阵、多任务学习和新型Mamba模块来解决MODIS数据中的混合像素、信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测在环境监测中至关重要，但由于混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性等MODIS特有的困难，该任务极具挑战性。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的过渡矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习框架（包含PreC-loss、PostC-loss和Chg-loss三个损失函数）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1分数比基线方法提高约1.5-6%，土地利用/土地覆盖分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法通过结合知识驱动和多任务学习策略，有效提升了MODIS变化检测的性能，为解决MODIS数据特有的挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet的鲁棒特征提取和扩散概率模型的生成能力，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤分割的边界精度和泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型（如U-Net）在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题

Method: 将NN-UNet与扩散概率模型结合，扩散模型学习预测分割掩码与真实掩码之间的残差误差分布，通过迭代去噪过程逐步优化分割结果

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上实验表明，NNDM在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上优于传统U-Net和基于Transformer的基线方法

Conclusion: NNDM为结合确定性分割网络和随机扩散模型开辟了新方向，推动了自动脑肿瘤分析的技术发展

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

### [7] [Adaptive Fusion Network with Temporal-Ranked and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Images for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09730)
*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补的表示方法和自适应融合网络，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有极低强度、难以察觉但能揭示真实情感的特点，在测谎、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。现有方法在捕捉微表情的时序进展和细微运动方面存在不足。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时序排序动态图像（强调时序进展）和运动强度动态图像（通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动）。设计自适应融合网络（AFN）自动学习最优整合这两种表示，增强判别性特征并抑制噪声。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，在SAMM数据集上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率，均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在输入表示和网络架构方面均有重要改进，为情感计算、测谎和人机交互等领域的研究和应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

*Muhammad Munsif,Waqas Ahmad,Amjid Ali,Mohib Ullah,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是第一篇全面综述多视角多摄像头（MVMC）系统的调查，将MVMC跟踪、重识别和动作理解统一到一个框架中，提出了新的分类法并总结了该领域的最新进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的调查主要关注孤立的任务（如跟踪、重识别、动作理解），忽略了它们在多摄像头协作系统中的整合。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供MVMC系统的综合视角。

Method: 提出了一个独特的分类法，将CVS分为四个关键部分：MVMC跟踪、重识别、动作理解和组合方法。系统性地整理了最先进的数据集、方法、结果和评估指标。

Result: 提供了该领域进展的结构化视图，识别了开放研究问题和挑战，包括终身学习、隐私和联邦学习等新兴技术。

Conclusion: 概述了增强CVS在复杂现实应用中鲁棒性、效率和适应性的关键研究方向，旨在启发创新解决方案并指导未来研究。

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过注意力引导的图像扭曲技术，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，重新分配输入图像的空间分辨率，使多模态大语言模型能够更好地识别小物体和空间关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常忽略小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。现有方法在测试时操作原始图像存在局限性。

Method: 利用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线扭曲，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，同时保留全局上下文信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM模型上，AttWarp一致提高了准确性，增强了组合推理能力，减少了幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲技术能够优先处理与查询相关的信息同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

TL;DR: 研究多模态情境下外语学习者如何通过图像和句子推断陌生单词含义，分析影响推断成功的特征因素，并评估AI系统预测学习者表现的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像-文本配对的多模态环境中，外语学习者如何推断陌生单词含义，以及哪些数据特征和学习者背景因素会影响推断成功率。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本对，分析图像和文本特征与参与者推断成功的关系，同时评估AI系统预测参与者表现的能力。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态外语学习环境具有研究价值，但需要更深入探索影响推断成功的特征因素，AI系统在该任务中的推理能力有待进一步提升。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对现有视觉大语言模型固定分辨率导致性能不佳的问题，提出了基于图像复杂度和模型不确定性的最优分辨率选择方法，并开发了参数高效的微调技术来扩展模型分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视觉语言应用需要不同粒度的感知能力，但现有VLLM假设固定分辨率导致下游任务性能不佳。

Method: 1. 研究不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现与图像复杂度和模型不确定性相关；2. 提出经验公式确定最优分辨率；3. 开发参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够根据任务需求自适应选择最优分辨率，显著提升VLLM在多样化视觉语言任务中的性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，但需谨慎控制合成数据使用量，过度依赖会导致性能下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实人脸图像数据因隐私问题难以大规模获取的局限性

Method: 采用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议评估泛化能力

Result: 适当控制合成图像数量可改善泛化能力，但仅使用合成数据会达到最高等错误率

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不是仅依赖合成数据进行S-MAD检测

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型细胞实例分割方法，通过利用细胞边界特征和标签来划分前景像素，优于现有像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法主要关注像素级目标，但可能丢失细胞实例的重要几何属性（如形状、曲率和凸性），这些属性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb方法首先使用改进的分水岭算法提取潜在的前景-前景边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），然后使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过划分或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用边界特征有效解决了像素级目标丢失几何信息的问题，为细胞实例分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习解决传统提示集成方法中特征平均导致类别中心偏移的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来代表类别，但这种方法会偏离真实的类别分布，导致次优结果

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到不同的类别簇中，每个簇由不同的提示表示。在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间，并引入聚类保持正则化和自适应提示权重技术

Result: 该方法能更好地与视觉特征分布对齐，保持提示的聚类特性，提高跨数据集和任务的鲁棒性能

Conclusion: CAPEL框架通过聚类感知的提示集成方法，有效解决了传统特征平均的局限性，提升了视觉语言模型的零样本迁移性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多目标跟踪方法，使用深度和掩码特征融合的自监督编码器来替代计算密集的IoU匹配，在复杂场景中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在目标相似或遮挡时不可靠，且分割掩码IoU计算成本高

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督编码器生成稳定目标表示，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配

Result: 在SportsMOT和DanceTrack等复杂基准测试中优于TBD最新方法，在MOT17等简单基准上达到竞争性性能

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，为复杂场景下的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HDR视频质量评估数据集主要关注专业生成内容（PGC），而YouTube、TikTok等平台的用户生成内容（UGC）由于拍摄条件、编辑伪影和压缩失真等因素带来了独特的质量评估挑战，现有数据集无法满足UGC-HDR视频的质量评估需求。

Method: 构建了CHUG数据集，包含856个UGC-HDR源视频，通过在不同分辨率和比特率下进行转码模拟真实场景，共生成5,992个视频。通过Amazon Mechanical Turk平台进行大规模主观研究，收集了211,848个感知评分。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集填补了UGC-HDR视频质量评估的研究空白，为真实世界UGC-HDR视频的质量分析提供了重要资源，将促进HDR视频质量评估技术的进步。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景具有不规则布局、复杂结构和遮挡问题，需要在不完整观测下最大化有限资源的利用率。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计信息，指导基函数的最优放置，并提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则放置的基线方法，渲染质量和内存需求都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于几何先验的场景自适应策略能够有效提升NeRF表示在复杂室内环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

TL;DR: 提出LTGS方法，通过稀疏视图更新实现长期高斯场景时序建模，能够高效处理日常环境变化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在稀疏捕捉条件下处理场景长期变化时面临的挑战，特别是日常环境中的频繁变化和时空观察密度不足的问题

Method: 构建对象模板高斯作为结构化的可重用先验，通过精炼管道基于少量观察调整先验以适应时间变化环境，支持多时间步的泛化转换

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实验表明，该方法相比基线方法实现了更优的重建质量，同时支持快速轻量级更新

Conclusion: LTGS框架为3D环境的时序演化提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理稀疏捕捉条件下的长期场景变化

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多视角动物姿态估计的综合框架，结合了新颖的训练和后处理技术，通过模型蒸馏提高效率，在有限标注数据下实现准确跟踪和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计效果不佳，需要开发更实用的不确定性感知系统来支持下游行为分析。

Method: 使用多视角变换器（MVT）同时处理所有视角信息，引入补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；结合几何一致性增强和三角化损失；扩展集成卡尔曼平滑器（EKS）到非线性情况，通过方差膨胀技术增强不确定性量化；设计蒸馏程序利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个实用、不确定性感知的系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下实现可靠的姿态估计，支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception

TL;DR: HeadsUp是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免传统混合方法产生的边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的面部图像。在处理肖像照片时，通常需要混合使用不同模型，但这会引入边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并整合了基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部恢复中的模糊性。同时构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Conclusion: HeadsUp通过端到端的方式有效解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，避免了传统混合方法带来的边界伪影问题，为肖像图像处理提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像在海洋研究和环境监测中至关重要，但由于环境复杂性和距离问题，图像质量普遍较差（如低可见度、模糊纹理、颜色失真和噪声）。现有图像增强方法存在泛化能力差和过度依赖清洁数据集的局限，且现有数据集缺乏多样性、质量低，多为单目图像，限制了不同光照条件和角度的表示。

Conclusion: 采用去噪扩散模型和Controlnet技术可以有效克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，提升图像质量与多样性，进而促进海洋生态研究的进展。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于从纵向MRI数据中建模脑老化轨迹，解决了传统深度学习方法在处理离散、不规则采样数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型老化轨迹非常有价值。但由于数据在个体内和群体间具有不同的空间和时间采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的INR架构，能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数，并设计了一个直接在INR参数空间上运行的框架来分类脑老化轨迹。使用生物学基础的轨迹模拟生成数据，在规则和不规则采样时间点进行实验。

Result: 在不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑老化轨迹分类任务上达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的不规则采样问题，为脑老化轨迹分析提供了更准确的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Motivation: 分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在实际应用中容易依赖虚假相关性而非真实物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 人机交互干预学习框架，将人类修正作为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似图像，引导模型学习语义特征而非数据集特定伪影。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应实际应用的分割系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出J-RAS方法，通过联合训练分割模型和检索模型，利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上实现显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺和泛化能力不足的问题，传统AI方法需要大量标注数据且难以应对患者间变异和罕见病例

Method: 联合检索增强分割（J-RAS），同时优化分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS后Dice分数从0.8708提升至0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降至1.1489，在多个架构和数据集上均显示一致性改进

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了医学图像分割性能，具有良好的泛化能力，能够适应不同架构和数据集

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的端到端交通监控框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率纵向分析，应用于纽约市拥堵收费政策评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高，现有视频分析技术难以处理动态摄像头视角和大规模数据，需要成本效益高的自动化交通监控解决方案

Method: 使用微调YOLOv11模型进行实时交通密度和分类检测，提出基于图的视角归一化方法处理非固定摄像头，集成领域专用大语言模型处理海量视频数据生成自动化摘要

Result: 在纽约市拥堵收费政策早期实施期间，工作日乘用车密度下降9%，卡车流量先降后升，行人和自行车活动持续增加，基于示例的提示提高了LLM数值准确性

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为大规模政策相关交通监控的实用基础设施就绪解决方案潜力，需要最少人工干预

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的物理信息方法用于生成镜头光晕数据，包括参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和基于物理引擎的3D渲染，构建了包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集通常通过在背景图像上叠加人工光晕模板进行2D合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽视物理原理，导致训练模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成、物理引擎3D渲染，构建FlareX数据集（9,500个2D模板和3,000个3D渲染图像对）。还设计了掩码方法从真实光晕图像中获取无光晕图像用于性能评估。

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息光晕数据生成方法能有效解决现有数据集缺乏多样性和物理真实性的问题，提升模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

TL;DR: 提出BurstDeflicker基准数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明的时间强度变化相互作用导致短曝光图像出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀亮度分布和暗带，不仅影响图像质量，还影响目标检测和跟踪等高级任务。现有研究缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究进展。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成管道，可控制关键闪烁属性（强度、面积、频率）生成多样化闪烁模式；2. 采集4000张真实世界闪烁图像；3. 提出绿屏方法在动态场景中保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了可扩展的闪烁去除基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集有望推动闪烁去除研究的发展，为解决滚动快门相机在交流电照明下的闪烁问题提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型仅依赖文本指令输入，缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出仅提供文本答案，缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出MIMO统一医学视觉语言模型，具备视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。构建MIMOSeg数据集（89.5万样本），从四个角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医学多模态任务上的实验验证了MIMO独特的视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是以往模型不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医学视觉语言模型在输入输出方面的局限性，能够结合视觉线索和文本指令理解复杂医学图像，并将医学术语在图像中进行像素级定位。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter）方法，通过轻量级视觉适配器模块实现多模态大语言模型的高效微调，在视频描述任务中仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全参数微调相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，对多模态任务中视觉信息的理解不足，且随着模型规模增大，全参数微调的计算成本过高

Method: 在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询标记和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与描述相关的特征

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在PEFT方法中达到SOTA性能，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上表现优异，与全参数微调方法相比性能相当

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡描述质量和参数效率方面具有强大潜力，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种新颖的动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过时空预测、自适应量化和熵编码技术，实现了对动态场景的高效压缩，在保持重建质量的同时大幅降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS算法忽略了动态场景中存在的显著时空冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的4D场景建模方法。

Method: 设计了基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，采用自适应量化策略和基于上下文的熵编码来压缩3D锚点数据。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别实现了40倍和90倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过借鉴视频压缩技术，有效解决了动态3DGS的内存消耗问题，为紧凑的4D场景建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法难以充分提取多模态系数和时间动态信息。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够全面处理空间-时间上下文的新方法。

Method: 提出CCFormer框架，包含三个核心组件：早期集成模块（EIM）用于跨模态互补性增强，多查询Transformer模块（MTM）用于空间特征提取和时间一致性建模，双模态对比学习（BCL）用于特征空间对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进性能基准，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效的设计组合，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，为音频-视觉分割任务提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和优化感兴趣区域。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，支持多步视觉推理；构建包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据；采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调指导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: ViTAR在广泛评估中优于现有最先进模型；视觉注意力分析显示从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，模型逐渐锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Conclusion: DREAM基准为深度伪造视觉真实性评估这一新方向提供了基础，对相关领域研究具有重要价值

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了有效的自监督框架，可应用于自动驾驶、室内机器人等领域，并发布了完整的数据管道和扩展数据集。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的大规模滑坡疤痕时空演化追踪框架，通过将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单时相或灾前灾后双时相滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和失效前兆至关重要。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够从无位姿的稀疏图像实现稳健的新视角合成和几何一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经辐射场和3D高斯泼溅技术严重依赖精确的相机位姿和密集的视角覆盖，这在稀疏视角设置中限制了应用，因为位姿估计变得不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 利用VGGT基础模型获取更可靠的初始位姿和密集点云；采用混合高斯表示与双位置-形状优化；集成图引导的属性细化模块；使用基于流的深度正则化。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上相比其他无位姿方法实现了更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架有效解决了稀疏视角下无位姿3D重建的挑战，为相关应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Motivation: 利用视觉语言模型（如CLIP）强大的零样本预测能力，解决之前无监督联邦学习中分类问题不可行的挑战，探索新的研究机会。

Method: FedCoPL方法包括：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，在服务器聚合包含通用图像特征的视觉提示，在本地保留编码个性化知识的文本提示。

Result: 大量实验证明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将无监督联邦学习应用于分类问题，通过创新的伪标签协作和提示聚合机制实现了有效性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过答案一致性检查改进GRPO算法，解决RL训练中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GRPO方法在多模态问答任务中仅达到79.7%的推理-答案一致性，存在推理步骤与最终答案不匹配的问题

Method: 修改GRPO算法，增加辅助一致性检查：模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序再次提示模型预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励函数

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中分别比GRPO基线平均提升2.2%和1.5%

Conclusion: ACRE方法有效提高了推理-答案一致性，减少了模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有紧凑型深度学习模型（如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n）在火灾烟雾检测中存在误报和漏检问题，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限

Method: 设计轻量级置信度优化网络，集成不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理等视觉特征，在不修改基础模型的情况下调整检测分数

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上相比现有基线方法，精确率、召回率和平均精度均值均有提升，计算开销适中

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在实际火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Motivation: 图像篡改技术的进步带来了严重的安全威胁，现有监督方法依赖昂贵的像素级标注，而弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架包含对象化规则构建与自适应过滤来构建可靠知识库，以及多步渐进推理流程，模拟专家取证工作流程，从粗粒度提议到细粒度取证结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，还达到了与弱监督和全监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC通过系统利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性，为图像取证提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImmerIris数据集，这是目前最大的公开VR头显采集的离轴虹膜数据集，包含564名受试者的499,791张眼部图像。针对传统虹膜识别方法在沉浸式场景中的性能不足，提出了无需归一化的新范式，直接学习眼部图像，在多个挑战性因素下表现优于基于归一化的方法。

Motivation: 沉浸式应用（如AR/VR）中，通过头显摄像头采集的离轴虹膜图像存在视角畸变、质量退化等独特挑战，而现有数据集稀缺，传统基于正面采集的虹膜识别方法在此场景下性能不佳。

Method: 1) 构建ImmerIris大规模数据集；2) 设计评估协议以基准测试不同挑战因素下的识别方法；3) 提出无需归一化的识别范式，直接学习眼部图像特征。

Conclusion: 无需归一化的范式为鲁棒的沉浸式虹膜识别提供了有前景的方向，解决了传统方法在离轴采集场景下的局限性。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Motivation: 现有基于手势的PD识别系统性能不理想，需要更准确的PD严重程度评估方法来支持临床管理和干预开发

Method: 收集手指敲击视频，提取手腕和手部运动的时域、频域和幅度特征，构建CNN-BiLSTM-注意力混合深度学习框架进行多类PD严重程度分类

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出强大性能

Conclusion: 将时空表示与注意力机制相结合可以改进自动PD严重程度检测，有望成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展跟踪的非侵入性工具

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前低光照图像增强方法存在SSIM和PSNR分数低、计算需求高的问题，而超分辨率方法通常基于GAN且参数过多。需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出DeepFusionNet架构，使用自动编码器结构，分别应用于低光照图像增强（约250万参数）和超分辨率任务（约10万参数）。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光照增强任务达到SSIM 92.8%和PSNR 26.30；超分辨率任务在验证集上达到PSNR 25.30和SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持轻量级参数的同时，显著提升了图像增强和超分辨率的性能指标，证明了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi适合复杂果园环境中的无人机荔枝检测，展示了在精准农业中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于静态和动态3D场景着色的灵活框架，通过单张关键视图着色和个性化着色器传播颜色，实现色彩丰富且可控的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来保证多视图一致性，但牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。Color3D旨在解决这一问题，在保证跨视图和时间一致性的同时，保持色彩多样性和用户可控性。

Method: 核心方法是仅对单个关键视图进行着色，然后微调个性化着色器将颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用其内在归纳偏置将相应颜色一致地投影到新视图和视频帧中。使用Lab颜色空间的高斯泼溅表示进行3D场景重建。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致、色彩更丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新定义为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，具有增强的灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and

Conclusion: ReMix成功地将角色一致性生成和编辑任务统一到单一框架中，解决了现有方法的局限性，为角色一致的图像生成和编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SaFiRe框架，通过模仿人类两阶段认知过程来解决指称图像分割中的复杂表达问题，特别是在对象干扰和类别隐式表达场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指称图像分割方法主要处理简单表达（如短名词短语），但在处理真实世界中的模糊指称表达时存在局限，特别是对象干扰表达和类别隐式表达两种情况。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，基于Mamba模型的scan-then-update特性，实现先全局理解后细节精炼的两阶段认知过程，支持线性复杂度的多轮精炼。

Result: 在标准数据集和新提出的aRefCOCO基准测试上，SaFiRe均优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe框架有效解决了复杂指称表达的分割问题，其两阶段设计更符合人类认知过程，为处理真实世界模糊表达提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg是一个用于水下图像语义分割的新框架，通过主动采样策略和混合标签传播方法，在稀疏点标注条件下实现高效分割，比现有方法提升5% mIoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下生态监测需要语义分割技术，但密集标注成本高昂，稀疏点标注虽然容易获取但面临标注点选择和信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合标签传播技术。

Result: 在两个不同水下数据集上实验表明，SparseUWSeg优于现有方法，比D+NN提升5% mIoU。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了简单有效的交互式标注工具，帮助生态研究人员利用基础模型和计算机视觉技术高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

*Cristiano Patrício,Luís F. Teixeira,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med提出了一种基于transformer的可视化概念解释框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学应用中实现概念级定位映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在高风险场景（如医疗应用）中的实用性。

Method: 使用基于transformer的框架，引入多概念可学习token，通过专门的注意力层处理视觉和基于文本的概念token，生成概念级定位映射。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，并与黑盒模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的姿态估计方法，通过预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并在之间进行密集采样，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，从而提高姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出分层连续坐标编码（HCCE）方法，预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，并在两者之间进行密集采样，生成超密集的2D-3D对应关系。该方法基于透视n点（PnP）算法进行姿态估计。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法相比现有最先进方法表现出更好的性能，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过充分利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，该方法显著提高了姿态估计的准确性，为物体姿态估计领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文构建了无人机视频文本匹配数据集DVTMD，并提出TCMA框架，通过多粒度对齐实现无人机视频文本检索的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频数据量大但检索困难，现有数据集存在标注粗糙和冗余问题，无人机领域的文本-视频检索研究不足。

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集（2,864个视频，14,320个细粒度标注），提出TCMA框架，包含全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合、词引导补丁对齐，以及词和补丁选择模块和文本自适应动态温度机制。

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立首个完整基准，TCMA在文本到视频检索中达到45.5% R@1，视频到文本检索中达到42.8% R@1的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DVTMD数据集和TCMA框架有效解决了无人机视频文本检索问题，为相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型中的性别和种族偏见，该方法通过在伪标签选择过程中强制实施人口平衡，仅使用无标签图像即可改善模型公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型往往反映并放大训练数据中的人口偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组上表现不均。现有方法通常需要带标签的平衡数据，而该方法旨在在无监督条件下解决偏见问题。

Method: 伪平衡方法：在伪标签选择过程中强制实施人口平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的无标签图像，无需真实标签注释。通过两种条件进行评估：(1) 使用FairFace数据集微调有偏见的性别分类器；(2) 使用故意不平衡的训练数据进行压力测试。

Result: 伪平衡方法在AAF基准测试中取得79.81%的整体准确率，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差异超过49%的情况下，差距缩小至仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口平衡或适度倾斜的无标签数据集可以作为去偏现有计算机视觉模型的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式关系学习框架，将关系学习从二元扩展到n元，用于3D物体定位，通过分组监督损失和混合注意力机制在多模态场景图中实现全局关系匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法只建模成对对象的关系，忽略了n元组合在全局感知中的重要性，而自然语言描述往往涉及多个空间关系来区分相似物体。

Method: 扩展关系学习从二元到n元，设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在多模态场景图中使用混合注意力机制进一步定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能够有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理复杂空间关系描述时表现出色。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌作为主要恶性肿瘤需要复杂的病理学评估，现有深度学习模型缺乏准确性和泛化能力，通用基础模型在捕捉专科特征和任务适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 采用两阶段协同预训练：首先在14万张切片约1.9亿个组织块上进行自监督学习构建宫颈特异性特征提取器，然后通过250万图像-文本对进行多模态增强，最后整合多个下游诊断功能。

Result: CerS-Path系统支持8个诊断功能，包括罕见癌症分类和多模态问答，在五个中心的3173例前瞻性测试中保持99.38%筛查敏感性，展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CerS-Path系统在宫颈病理学领域实现了显著进步，展示了其在专科诊断转化和宫颈癌筛查方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个标准化的质量控制工具，能够系统诊断和针对性增强合成数据集，推动数据驱动自动驾驶系统的未来发展。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）中存在语义异常（如不合理的物体配置、违反物理定律或常识不一致），影响生成场景的可信度，需要检测这些语义级异常以评估AIGC媒体的可信度。

Method: 引入AnomReason大规模基准，包含结构化注释四元组（名称、现象、推理、严重程度），通过AnomAgent多智能体管道和轻量级人工验证生成注释，并基于该基准微调模型，提出语义匹配指标（SemAP和SemF1）。

Result: 在AnomReason上微调的模型相比强视觉语言基线在语义匹配指标上取得一致提升，应用于可解释深度伪造检测和图像生成器语义合理性评估，展示了实际效用。

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为测量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，支持语义真实性和可解释AIGC取证的可重复研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

TL;DR: 大型视觉模型在零样本设置下可直接应用于医学影像任务，无需特定领域训练即可在器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测等任务中取得竞争性表现，特别是在放疗运动预测中达到最先进水平。

Motivation: 探索自回归视频建模原理是否能直接应用于医学成像任务，即使模型从未在医学数据上训练过，验证通用视频模型在医学领域的零样本泛化能力。

Method: 使用大型视觉模型（LVM）在零样本设置下评估四个代表性任务：器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测。模型基于4D CT扫描数据，从未接触过医学数据。

Result: 在122名患者的4D CT数据（超过1,820个3D CT体积）上评估，模型在所有任务中都表现出色，在运动预测中超越了专门的DVF基线和生成基线，达到了最先进的空间精度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了医学视频建模中零样本能力的出现，突出了通用视频模型作为统一学习器和推理器的潜力，为未来基于视频模型的医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

### [64] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为轻量级渲染误差代理来替代标准位置梯度启发式，结合更保守的修剪策略和深度相关损失，在保持重建质量的同时显著减少基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在少样本场景下存在过拟合和重建膨胀问题，现有方法如FSGS虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量。本文旨在优化3DGS的核心优化过程，优先考虑效率。

Method: 1. 用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理替代标准位置梯度启发式；2. 采用更保守的修剪策略防止破坏性优化循环；3. 结合标准深度相关损失提供几何指导。

Result: 在3-view LLFF数据集上，模型比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs. 57k基元）；在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上实现约70%的基元减少，仅在重建指标上有适度权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量-效率帕累托前沿上建立了新的最先进水平，实现了基元数量的大幅减少而重建质量损失有限。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的框架，通过音频和稀疏手部姿态条件生成高质量半身人体动画，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）预训练手部清晰度码本（HCC）编码高保真手部纹理先验；2）设计双流音频感知模块（DSAA）分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3）引入姿态校准技巧（PCT）通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成视频具有优越的手部细节、姿态真实性和身份一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了音频驱动动画中的关键挑战，在定量指标和定性评估中都表现出色。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅依赖单一视角特征，无法充分利用细粒度物体细节和结构化场景表示的互补优势

Method: 提出BEV地图引导的基础模型，通过新颖的蒸馏过程将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，并使用可变形聚合整合PV和BEV特征

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 基础模型BEV地图能够为自动驾驶提供更可靠的感知能力

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA是一种参数高效的微调策略，通过集成低秩适配器到SAM2模型中，使用少于5%的可训练参数实现眼底图像分割的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2模型在低资源环境下具有快速推理能力，但微调仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发参数高效的微调方法以适应眼底图像分割任务。

Method: 在SAM2的图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，采用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络优化。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在交叉数据集训练条件下实现了血管分割Dice分数0.86、AUC 0.98，视盘分割Dice分数0.93、AUC 0.99的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了眼底图像分割的SOTA性能，证明了参数高效微调策略的有效性。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的真实世界房间

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成逼真的3D场景，解决了真实场景数据稀缺和物体姿态多样性生成的挑战

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of

demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，显著提升了模型对未知场景的适应能力。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Result: 在血压估计等多项任务上达到SOTA性能，并在其他生命体征和血液检测任务上表现优异

Conclusion: Vision4PPG为临床科学家提供了新的高效工具，展示了视觉模型在PPG信号处理中的强大泛化能力

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以解释其决策过程，容易受到背景信息的偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）将图像分割成小块并随机打乱；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换来恢复背景噪声信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别CNN分类中的背景噪声偏见，有助于提高模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 提出的结合特征空间顺序和渐进式匹配的方法能够有效提高图像特征匹配的效率和准确性，为计算机视觉任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练的InceptionV3模型从VR游戏视频中提取视觉特征，结合LSTM网络捕捉时间动态，预测VR使用中的晕动症严重程度，达到68.4%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR技术在各领域应用日益广泛，但晕动症问题阻碍了其普及。现有研究多关注多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征预测晕动症的研究有限。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，使用ImageNet预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络分析时间序列数据来预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 模型在晕动症严重程度分类上达到68.4%的准确率，优于仅使用视频数据的现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为VR开发者提供了评估和减轻晕动症的有效工具，并为基于视频的时间建模研究奠定了基础，有助于提升VR应用的用户舒适度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个人类化检索增强生成框架，通过"what-where-reweight"级联方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提高定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有检索增强生成方法仅关注全局图像信息，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: HuLiRAG采用三级联方法：1)通过开放词汇检测将查询锚定到候选参照物（what）；2)使用SAM衍生掩码进行空间解析以恢复细粒度精度（where）；3)通过局部与全局对齐的权衡自适应优先排序（reweight）。掩码引导的微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 大量实验表明，这种人类化级联方法提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理的发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG框架通过模拟人类认知过程的多阶段推理，显著改善了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的表现，为实现可信的多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，通过条件去噪扩散过程解决无标记、基于图像的机器人位姿估计问题，在最具挑战性的数据集上实现了66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人位姿估计方法使用固定尺度的扰动，缺乏多样性和视野内约束，限制了网络的泛化能力。需要一种能够生成视野内多样化训练位姿的方法来提高估计精度。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：1）视野约束扩散过程 - 渐进扰动真实位姿到噪声变换，集成视野约束确保变换在相机视野内；2）时间步感知反向过程 - 通过去噪网络迭代预测位姿，按时间步从扩散后验采样进行渐进细化，实现从粗到精的位姿优化。

Result: 在两个基准测试（DREAM和RoboKeyGen）上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。反向过程展现出比直接预测更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion通过集成视野约束的扩散过程和时序感知的细化方案，有效提升了单目机器人位姿估计的精度和鲁棒性，为无标记位姿估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了CoDeGraph算法，用于零样本图像异常分类和分割，通过检测和过滤一致异常模式来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致异常（相似缺陷在多个图像中重复出现）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，通过共享一致异常模式连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常。基于极值理论提供理论基础

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络达到98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割性能提升4.2% F1和5.4% AP；使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法能有效识别和过滤一致异常，在不同骨干网络架构下都表现出优异的零样本异常检测性能

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的医学图像分割标注方法，通过模拟临床专家小组的协作决策过程来处理标注者间差异性问题，而不是简单地平均专家标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间差异性问题，传统方法简单地平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性这一有价值的信息。

Method: 提出了群体决策模拟框架，包括专家特征生成器（ESG）学习个体标注者风格，以及模拟咨询模块（SCM）从该空间智能生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，Dice分数分别达到92.11%和90.72%。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，该方法为构建更鲁棒和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiTIPS——首个公开的多中心TIPS预后数据集，并基于此开发了一个多模态预后框架，解决了现有方法在ROI标注、多模态融合和单终点预测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIPS手术虽然广泛应用于门脉高压治疗，但存在生存结果差异大和肝性脑病高发的问题，需要准确的术前预后模型。现有方法面临ROI标注耗时、单模态可靠性差和单终点评估不完整等挑战。

Method: 框架包含三个核心模块：(1)双选项分割：集成半监督和基础模型管道实现稳健ROI分割；(2)多模态交互：通过MGRA、POD和CGPE技术实现跨模态特征交互；(3)多任务预测：采用分阶段训练策略同时优化生存、PPG和OHE预测。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态预后框架在临床应用中具有良好前景，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)方法，通过解码时利用原始模型与视觉语言注意力降级模型之间的输出分布差异，来减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成的回答虽然语言流畅但与图像内容无关，这主要是由于语言偏见导致的。

Method: CMG是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过自适应地掩码选定transformer层中最具影响力的图像token的注意力权重，来降级视觉语言感知，从而强调视觉上下文感知。

Result: 实验结果表明CMG在幻觉特定基准测试上显著提升了不同VLM的性能，且能有效泛化，无需额外条件或训练成本。

Conclusion: CMG通过降级诱导的解码有效减少了语言偏见，显著降低了幻觉问题，同时不损害VLM的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪图像方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽略结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和区分能力有限。需要一种既能保持高效性又能提取判别性特征的方法。

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征关联和全局上下文信息；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征区分度；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的精度，实现了高性能与实时性的平衡。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在LiDAR点云语义分割任务中表现出色，具有良好的实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于微手势识别的新模型MSF-Mamba，通过运动感知状态融合模块解决了传统Mamba模型在局部时空建模方面的不足，在保持高效性的同时实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长距离和局部时空依赖关系。传统CNN模型难以捕捉长距离依赖，Transformer模型计算成本高，而Mamba模型虽然高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出了MSF-Mamba模型，通过运动感知状态融合模块（基于中心帧差分）来增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，并设计了多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，包含自适应尺度加权模块。

Result: 在两个公开的微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也达到了SOTA性能，超越了现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持了高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba模型通过运动感知状态融合有效解决了微手势识别中的局部时空建模问题，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为微手势识别任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于三角一致性原则的自优化框架，证明视觉语言模型具有自我优化能力，能够无需外部监督自主生成高质量训练数据并实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型主要通过监督式视觉指令调优进行训练，但模型在无监督指令训练下的潜力尚未被充分探索。本文旨在验证VLMs是否具备内在的自我优化能力。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自优化框架：1）通过多任务指令调优增强模型指令生成能力；2）从未标注图像生成图像-查询-回答三元组，并用三角一致性原则进行过滤；3）使用过滤后的合成数据进一步更新模型。

Result: 以LLaVA-1.5为基线，实验表明模型能够在无外部监督（如人工标注或环境反馈）的情况下，在多个基准测试上实现持续但适度的改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备自我优化能力，这一发现可为未来研究VLMs学习机制提供重要启示。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Motivation: 标准旋转位置编码在图像生成中存在空间关系建模、颜色线索和物体计数等显著局限性，需要改进以适应复杂的结构偏差。

Method: 提出HARoPE方法，在旋转映射前插入基于奇异值分解的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面对齐和头部特定位置感受野。

Conclusion: HARoPE作为即插即用的替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供了原则性和适应性强的位置感知增强方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过jigsaw操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）来抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，实现快速、视角一致的3D风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D风格迁移方法要么依赖直接参考风格标记注入，要么使用2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，这需要进行大量逐场景优化，且常常将风格与语义内容纠缠在一起。

Method: 利用jigsaw操作分离风格与内容，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中，生成视角一致的风格化渲染，最后将渲染结果风格烘焙到表面以获得无缝纹理。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，且延迟显著降低，并能推广到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D通过有效分离风格与内容，提供了一种高效且通用的3D风格迁移解决方案，在保持视角一致性的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker是一种新的多模态奖励模型框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口解决现有模型在视觉输入处理中的限制，在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多模态奖励模型的两个主要限制：视觉输入占用大量上下文预算导致细节丢失，以及将所有视觉信息打包到初始提示中加剧了链式思维推理中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 引入VR-Thinker框架，配备视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口；采用三阶段强化微调流程：冷启动、拒绝采样微调和组相对策略优化。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中取得优异表现：VideoGen Reward达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench达到82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video达到75.6%，尤其在长视频处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: VR-Thinker验证了"思维与图像"多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景，为视觉生成模型的后期训练提供了更可靠的奖励信号。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种扩展CNN感受野的新方法，通过优化格向量量化器、不规则扩张卷积和U型级联LUT结构，在保持相同空间复杂度的情况下提升LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法因表大小组合爆炸而受限卷积核感受野，需要在不增加空间复杂度的前提下扩展感受野以提升性能。

Method: 1. 学习最优格向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率；2. 引入不规则扩张卷积；3. 设计U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 该方法在速度、精度和内存效率之间取得有效平衡，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法成功解决了LUT方法感受野受限问题，为快速CNN推理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 将模式分析嵌入识别阶段的方法有效融合了计算机视觉和语言建模，为智能交通和监控应用提供了更强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

TL;DR: 提出MCE方法解决多模态学习中缺失模态不平衡问题，通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示能力来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在缺失模态（尤其是缺失率不平衡）时面临挑战：缺失率高的模态更新少，导致学习进度不一致和表示退化，形成恶性循环。现有方法多关注全局平衡，忽略了样本级模态效用变化和特征质量退化问题

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：1) 学习能力增强(LCE) - 引入多级因子动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) 表示能力增强(RCE) - 通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估显示，MCE在各种缺失配置下均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: MCE方法有效解决了多模态学习中的缺失模态不平衡问题，通过动态平衡学习和增强表示能力实现了性能提升

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究主要关注事后制图，而预测研究受到数据碎片化和单模态数据的限制，需要结合视觉指标和物理前兆的协调数据集。

Method: 整合Sentinel-2多光谱影像进行空间监测、NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品分析冰川运动学、MODIS地表温度记录，并进行云掩蔽、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和循环编码等预处理，最后进行多模态协调。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters

that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep

inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器在视觉理解和生成之间存在显著的性能权衡，因为高层次语义抽象和低层次像素重建之间存在内在冲突。目标是开发一个既能继承强语义特征用于视觉理解，又能适应细粒度细节用于视觉生成的统一分词器。

Conclusion: UniFlow通过创新的自适应蒸馏和像素流解码器设计，成功解决了视觉理解与生成之间的冲突，实现了统一的视觉分词器，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Motivation: 传统光流估计方法在高速和低光场景中面临运动模糊和光照不足的挑战，导致纹理减弱、噪声放大，影响外观饱和度和边界完整性。帧相机提供密集外观饱和度但边界完整性稀疏，而事件相机提供稀疏外观饱和度但边界完整性密集。现有方法通过特征融合或域适应引入事件数据改善边界完整性，但外观特征仍然退化，严重影响判别式和生成式模型的性能。

Method: 提出Diff-ABFlow框架，基于扩散模型学习从噪声流到清晰流的映射，不受退化视觉特征影响。采用帧-事件外观-边界融合策略，结合帧相机的外观饱和度和事件相机的边界完整性优势。

Result: 该方法通过扩散模型有效解决了退化场景下的光流估计问题，避免了传统方法对退化视觉特征的依赖。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的帧-事件融合框架为高速和低光场景下的光流估计提供了新的解决方案，能够有效应对运动模糊和光照不足带来的挑战。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于基线方法，在大语义空间场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型是OOD检测的有效工具，提出的MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略能有效提升大语义空间下的检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有方法虽然性能优秀，但需要在不同图像尺度上迭代执行，且每次迭代都需要将语言特征和视觉特征存储在缓存中，带来额外开销。

Method: 设计了一个整体网络架构，直接封装语言和视觉模态，利用语言作为指导并行促进语言模态和视觉模态的交互，提取有效的视觉特征。引入了基于相似性的特征选择机制，仅利用语言相关的视觉特征进行快速预测。

Conclusion: FSVG是一种简单有效的视觉定位基线方法，通过特征选择机制减少了计算成本，同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法性能次优，RLVR在处理超出模型知识库的任务时存在困难，需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf目标函数，在RLVR过程中注入真实标签，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定训练过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf为大型视觉语言模型的后训练提供了有效的统一框架，验证了其设计原理的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要开发能够处理多任务质量评估的统一框架。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成链式思维数据集用于监督微调。采用基于高斯分布的奖励进行后训练，并引入标准差过滤和熵门控机制来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键图像质量评估任务上进行了评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和文本-图像对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理多维度质量推理，为策略优化提供连续可解释的奖励信号。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

*Zhaolin Hu,Kun Li,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强线性注意力机制的混合框架，通过增加注意力矩阵的秩和降低注意力分布的熵来提高图变换器的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性注意力机制在效率上优势明显，但表达能力不足，主要由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布导致节点表示的可分离性降低。

Method: 提出混合框架：1）在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增加注意力矩阵的秩；2）在注意力分数中引入可学习的对数幂函数来降低熵并锐化注意力焦点。

Result: 在同质性和异质性图基准测试中，该方法在保持线性注意力可扩展性的同时，实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了线性注意力机制的表达能力限制问题，在理论和实验上均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的音频驱动说话人生成方法在时间连贯性和细粒度运动控制方面仍面临挑战，需要更好的解耦控制机制。

Method: 提出运动自编码器构建结构化潜在空间，其中运动因子独立表示并近似正交化；在此基础上应用基于最优传输的流匹配和transformer预测器来生成音频条件化的平滑运动轨迹。

Conclusion: 将细粒度运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话人视频合成提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: MSM-Seg框架通过创新的双记忆分割范式有效解决了多模态脑肿瘤分割中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更准确的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了动作动态学习和跨时间交互的重要性，为未来动作理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了同时处理散焦和运动模糊的挑战，为高质量动态高斯泼溅提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该框架通过认知机制建模有效解决了VR/AR系统中的行为预测问题，为创建响应式环境和个性化助手等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

*Kagan Ozturk,Aman Bhatta,Haiyu Wu,Patrick Flynn,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种局部可加的人脸相似度度量方法，通过分解全局相似度为局部块级相似度得分，实现模型决策过程的内在可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法对黑盒模型的可解释性存在保真度不确定性，需要设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将人脸相似度定义为局部块级相似度得分的总和，使用受限感受野来分解全局相似度，提供局部可加的解释。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用28x28小尺寸块时达到竞争性验证性能，使用56x56块时超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了内在可解释的相似度度量，在保持性能的同时提供透明决策过程。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的2.5D方法，用于3D胸部CT扫描的多标签分类，通过将轴向切片表示为图节点来捕捉层间依赖关系，在跨数据集泛化方面表现出色。

Motivation: 随着CT检查量的增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长距离依赖，而Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练数据。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，使模型能够推理层间依赖关系，同时保持临床部署的复杂度。

Result: 在3个独立机构的数据集上训练和评估，实现了强大的跨数据集泛化能力，与最先进的视觉编码器相比具有竞争力。消融研究评估了不同聚合策略、边权重方案和图连接模式的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在胸部CT多标签分类中表现优异，并展示了在自动放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的更广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成面临颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象挑战，不同水域的风格变化显著，现有生成模型难以建模非均匀的水下环境条件

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用独立编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN集成潜在表示并解码生成最终图像，对每个风格聚类独立训练

Result: 在SSIM(0.9012)、PSNR(32.5118 dB)和FID(13.3728)指标上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架能有效建模水下环境的非均匀条件，生成高质量的水下图像

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

TL;DR: imHead是一种新颖的隐式3D可变形模型，通过引入区域特定的潜在表示来实现局部编辑，解决了传统3DMM在表示复杂头部形状方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型依赖严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状。现有方法直接将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在维度庞大且效率低下。

Method: 提出imHead模型，保留单一紧凑的身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑。使用包含4000个不同身份的大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验证明imHead在表示多样化身份和表情方面优于先前方法，能够捕捉复杂的头部形状变化。

Conclusion: imHead提供了一种可解释的3D面部操作解决方案，支持用户进行局部编辑，为大规模3D头部建模迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注数据对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于具有复杂动态形状的3D时间序列细胞图像，手动标注非常耗时且具有挑战性。

Method: 三名标注人员对Cell Tracking Challenge中的MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞序列进行了完整3D时间序列分割标注，并与CTC提供的自动标注结果进行了比较。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异范围内，且比自动生成的标注更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于细胞分割算法的测试和训练，以及分析高度动态物体的3D形状，为细胞图像处理研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高且复杂，主要由于深层Transformer架构和冗余令牌导致。

Method: 1. 误差约束层合并：选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的Transformer层；2. 掩码引导令牌合并：专注于合并对最终预测贡献小的背景令牌；3. 扩散解码器：结合时间上下文并利用从大规模运动捕捉数据集中学习的姿态先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了高达2.3倍的加速，同时性能略有提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了3D人体网格恢复模型的计算效率问题，在加速的同时保持了甚至略微提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Conclusion: 通过合成数据补充和跨域语义对齐，有效解决了点云分割中的长尾问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在开放世界条件下的图像地理定位能力尚未得到全面评估，而这项任务在实际应用中具有重要需求和挑战性。

Method: 创建EarthWhere基准测试，包含两个地理定位尺度：WhereCountry（国家级别）和WhereStreet（街道级别）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法，包括Shapley重加权思维评分。对13个最先进的VLM进行基准测试。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。研究发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在减轻偏见和实现稳健细粒度定位方面的持续挑战，同时展示了VLM在地理定位任务中的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了多语言视觉语言模型的性能，还为表示学习中的拓扑对齐提供了一般性方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制，引入基于距离变化掩码的区域控制机制，并采用基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现提示引导的文本区域风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性，为场景文本编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various
conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual
descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing
GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization,
color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with
textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

*Chunyu Xie,Bin Wang,Fanjing Kong,Jincheng Li,Dawei Liang,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和多种判别目标，在英语和中文的细粒度对齐任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在细粒度视觉语言理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境下，对物体属性、空间关系和语言表达的细粒度细节捕捉能力不足，且双语理解支持有限。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配和长文本建模等细粒度监督方法，结合多种判别目标，并引入文本模态内对比损失（TIC）来更好地区分语义相似的描述。

Result: 在29个数据集、8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在双语性能上超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过精心设计的训练策略和新的评测基准，有效推动了双语细粒度对齐研究的发展，并发布了模型、代码和基准以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV是一个仅使用多视角RGB图像进行6D姿态估计的管道，通过密集关键点级融合和三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，在纹理缺失物体上表现出色，甚至超越RGB-D方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D姿态估计中深度信息丢失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，提高预测精度并解决对称物体的模糊性问题。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的大量实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，并且在大多数情况下甚至超越RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: DKPMV证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

### [134] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准、实例级别的分布偏移不确定性指示器，通过重建稳定性检测OOD样本，为生成式先验模型提供轻量级保护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现优异，但存在对分布外样本产生幻觉特征的风险，现有不确定性量化方法存在校准依赖、启发式估计或无法区分分布偏移等问题。

Method: 基于"分布内图像重建对随机测量变化稳定，而分布外图像重建不稳定"的假设，利用重建稳定性作为分布偏移代理指标，提出可高效计算的不确定性指示器。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层扫描重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的先验网络在测试所有数字时，OOD数字显示出更高的重建变异性和误差，验证了该指示器的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成式先验模型部署提供了轻量级保护策略，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量压缩，同时在分布外时自动预警。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树（IUT）的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、实体身份和风格上的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E）在多模态图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，这严重限制了它们在复杂图像-文本输入-输出场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出的框架分两个阶段运行：（1）动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为分层符号结构；（2）协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准测试的准确性，还在多样化的多模态问答场景中有效缓解了三种关键形式的上下文漂移。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理有效解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，提升了多模态生成的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和自动可验证奖励来微调大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的框架，旨在提高图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务上表现出色，但在分布外(OOD)数据上性能下降，并且在生成链式思维(CoT)推理过程时表现更差，限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: Chart-RVR框架包含三个奖励函数：(i)正确分类图表类型，(ii)忠实重建图表数据表，(iii)过程一致性。该框架使用GRPO方法对30亿参数的LVLMs进行微调。

Result: Chart-RVR-3B系列模型在六个图表推理基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，超越了所有同等规模模型，在分布内和分布外数据上都优于标准监督微调(SFT)。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR不仅提高了模型准确性，还生成了更可解释的CoT推理过程，增强了模型的可靠性和可信度，展示了可验证奖励与GRPO结合在训练可靠、可解释图表推理模型方面的强大能力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出Multimodal Mixup (MM)和Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM)两种方法来解决多模态模型容易过拟合强模态的问题，通过特征混合和动态调整混合比例来提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视频理解中，模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，影响模型性能。

Method: MM在多模态特征聚合层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在MM基础上根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明，该方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法能有效缓解多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Method: 建立了一个概念框架，从三个基本维度组织Agentic MLLMs：智能内部功能（作为系统指挥官，通过推理、反思和记忆实现准确的长时程规划）、外部工具调用（主动使用外部工具扩展问题解决能力）和环境交互（在虚拟或物理环境中采取行动、适应策略并维持目标导向行为）。

Conclusion: 综述了Agentic MLLMs的下游应用，并概述了这一快速演进领域的未来研究方向，为社区研究提供了系统性指导。

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Conclusion: PAInpainter在3D修复质量和泛化能力方面表现出色，证明了其在提升全局一致性和纹理保真度方面的有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

TL;DR: ContextGen是一个基于Diffusion Transformer的多实例图像生成框架，通过布局锚定和身份一致性注意力机制解决多实例生成中的布局控制和身份保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在两个关键限制：难以实现精确的对象布局控制，以及无法保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含两个核心技术：1）上下文布局锚定机制，将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中；2）身份一致性注意力机制，利用上下文参考图像确保多实例身份一致性。同时构建了首个大规模层次化标注数据集IMIG-100K。

Result: 大量实验表明，ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面均优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的布局锚定和身份一致性机制，有效解决了多实例图像生成的挑战，为相关领域提供了新的技术路径和基准数据集。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似度高，导致上下文区分困难

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整体空间的区分；2) 基于小波变换的频率增强模块提取高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界几何连续性

Result: 在多个医学数据集上表现出优越性能，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面效果显著

Conclusion: FASS框架显著提升低对比度图像分割能力，为更复杂医学成像场景的应用铺平道路

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在持续弱点，当任务需要理解图像中多个对象、属性和关系之间的交互时往往表现不佳。现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出COCO-Tree方法，通过从LLM学习的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用束搜索启发的推理过程，既提升性能又提供预测理由。

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试（Winoground、EqBench、ColorSwap、SugarCrepe）上，针对七个不同规模的开源VLM进行实验，COCO-Tree相比基线显著提升了5-10%的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree通过结合LLM的语义理解能力有效弥补了VLM的语言推理局限，在保持资源效率的同时提供了可解释的推理过程，显著提升了组合推理性能。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频人体姿态估计方法难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面有潜力但仅限于1D数据。

Method: 提出Global Spatiotemporal Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和调制合并，以及Local Refinement Mamba通过窗口化时空扫描增强局部关键点运动细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于现有最先进方法，并实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba模型到时空建模，有效解决了VHPE中的全局-局部平衡和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前的大视觉语言模型在处理复杂几何问题时，辅助线推理能力不足，而直接编辑几何图形的方法在几何精度上存在困难。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励机制评估生成的辅助线文本描述与真实辅助线图形的匹配程度，并基于GRPO算法进行优化。构建了AuxSolidMath数据集支持训练。

Result: 在3B和7B规模下，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有的大视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 文本描述方法比图形编辑更适合大视觉语言模型的辅助线推理，强化学习框架能有效提升几何问题的解决能力。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估统一多模态模型在理解与生成对齐、复杂视觉任务泛化能力的严谨基准

Method: 设计三个互补评估维度：理解-生成一致性、推理中心文本到图像生成、多步推理编辑，并为每个子集定制专门的评估流程

Result: 统一模型在推理驱动视觉任务上表现更好，但理解与生成之间仍存在持续差距

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为评估统一多模态模型提供了系统框架，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的挑战

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

TL;DR: Vlaser是一个视觉-语言-动作模型，旨在弥合具身推理与VLA策略学习之间的差距，通过整合高层次推理和低层控制来实现先进的具身智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在开发基于VLM的具身推理能力或将先进VLM集成到VLA模型中，但很少直接解决上游VLM推理与下游VLA策略学习之间的关键差距。

Method: 基于高质量的Vlaser-6M数据集构建Vlaser模型，系统研究不同VLM初始化对监督VLA微调的影响，并提出缓解互联网规模预训练数据与具身特定策略学习数据之间领域偏移的新方法。

Result: Vlaser在一系列具身推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，包括空间推理、具身基础、具身问答和任务规划。在WidowX基准上取得最先进结果，在Google Robot基准上表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功弥合了具身推理与VLA策略学习之间的差距，为具身智能体的高层次推理与低层控制整合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的两阶段框架，利用CLIP的异常定位能力和SAM的边界感知能力进行零样本异常分割，通过Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation模块和Cascaded Prompts for SAM模块实现精准的工业异常检测。


<details>

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍面临挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation模块协作使用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于异常区域分割；2）Cascaded Prompts for SAM模块使用混合提示和轻量级解码器优化分割结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的零样本异常分割结果，特别是在Visa数据集上F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最优方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了基础模型在工业异常检测中的引导问题，显著提升了零样本异常分割性能。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

TL;DR: LaryngealCT是一个标准化的喉癌CT数据集，包含1,029个扫描，用于开发可复现的深度学习模型，在早期vs晚期和T4vs非T4分类任务中取得了良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可复现的深度学习模型开发。

Method: 从TCIA收集6个数据集的1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取统一的1mm各向同性感兴趣区域，评估了3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101和DenseNet121等3D深度学习架构。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.881，F1-macro-0.821），ResNet18在T4vs非T4分类中表现最佳（AUC-0.892，F1-macro-0.646）。3D GradCAM可视化显示非T4病例更多关注软骨周围区域，T4预测显示局灶性激活。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持ID和结构一致性，限制了其在实际应用中的效果。

Method: 将人脸表征分解为ID和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现ID和属性的独立控制。

Result: 方法支持仅使用文本提示进行复杂多属性人脸编辑，无需区域特定输入，运行速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明了其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持ID和结构一致性的同时，实现了精确的面部属性操作，为人脸编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动视频对象分割技术在真实复杂场景下的发展，解决传统基准测试中未充分涵盖的挑战性问题，如密集小物体、频繁消失重现、严重遮挡、恶劣天气等。

Method: 挑战赛设置三个赛道：经典VOS、参考VOS和新增的MOSEv2赛道。采用标准评估指标（J、F、J&F）和针对MOSEv2的新指标J&Ḟ，以更好地评估不同尺度和消失情况下的对象分割性能。

Result: 总结了顶级解决方案和新兴趋势，发现LLM/MLLM组件和内存感知传播技术的作用日益重要，为未来在野外环境中实现弹性和语言感知的视频分割指明了方向。

Conclusion: MOSEv2赛道显著提升了挑战难度，推动了视频分割技术在真实复杂场景下的发展，强调了长期一致性和泛化能力的重要性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无源目标检测方法要么局限于传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，要么作为通用解决方案未针对新型检测架构（特别是DETR）进行定制化设计。

Method: FRANCK包含四个关键组件：基于目标性得分的样本重加权模块、基于匹配记忆库的对比学习模块、不确定性加权的查询融合特征蒸馏模块，以及改进的自训练流程。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FRANCK有效将源域预训练的DETR模型适配到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Motivation: 现有CAD图纸符号识别方法主要关注几何基元，忽视了文本标注信息，且缺乏对基元间关系的显式建模，导致对图纸理解不全面。

Method: 构建几何和文本基元的统一表示，使用预训练CNN提取视觉特征作为初始表示，采用Transformer骨干网络结合类型感知注意力机制来显式建模不同类型基元间的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在涉及文本标注的符号识别任务中优于现有方法，并在复杂CAD图纸中表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的结合文本标注的全景符号识别框架能够有效提升CAD图纸的符号识别性能，特别是在处理包含文本标注的复杂图纸时具有明显优势。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 传统端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态性和时间演化的影响，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中的适应性和决策能力。作者认为车辆未来轨迹与环境动态演化相互影响，需要双向建模。

Method: SeerDrive框架包含两个关键组件：(1)未来感知规划：将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器；(2)迭代场景建模和车辆规划：通过协作优化同时细化未来场景预测和轨迹生成。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的大量实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划的闭环方法，能够显著提升自动驾驶系统在复杂场景中的决策能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于监督扩散的去噪框架，用于防御多模态大语言模型中的视觉对抗攻击，通过配对对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，并结合提示优化机制，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像描述、视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但其多模态特性使其容易受到对抗攻击。现有防御方法如对抗训练和输入净化存在计算成本高、图像质量下降和泛化能力不足等问题，因此需要更有效的防御策略。

Method: 提出监督扩散去噪框架，利用配对对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，并引入任务特定的方向性指导。同时结合提示优化作为补充防御机制，增强对多样化和未知攻击策略的抵抗能力。

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答任务上的大量实验表明，该方法不仅显著提高了鲁棒性，而且对未知对抗攻击表现出强大的迁移能力，同时保持了高质量的图像重建效果。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪方法为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，为多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠和安全部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Conclusion: MoMap表示法有效解决了3D运动预测问题，为视频生成提供了新思路

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决连续胸部X光序列中的冗余问题和与电子健康记录的时间不对齐问题，在疾病进展建模中取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）在疾病进展建模中存在两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像数据与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: DiPro框架采用区域感知解耦将CXR序列中的静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征分离，并通过局部（成对间隔级）和全局（全序列）同步层次化对齐这些特征与异步EHR数据。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能够有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架成功解决了多模态时序数据中的关键挑战，为疾病进展建模提供了有效的解决方案，在临床预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: SynTrans是一个新颖的小样本学习框架，通过协同知识转移从大型多模态模型中提取多样互补知识，显著提升小样本分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本学习方法利用小规模模型的语义知识来解决数据稀缺问题，但这些方法往往会引入噪声和偏差

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，小样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务进行语义对齐的视觉知识蒸馏；包含训练免费的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器

Result: 在四个小样本学习数据集上的实验表明，SynTrans即使搭配简单的视觉编码器也能显著超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效利用大型多模态模型的互补知识，成功解决了小样本学习中的数据稀缺和噪声问题

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在生成正确数量对象方面存在困难，单纯扩大模型和数据规模无法解决计数准确性问题。研究发现噪声初始化对计数结果有重要影响，并提出了通过注入计数感知布局信息来有效控制生成对象数量的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型（如FLUX和GPT-4o）在遵循文本提示中的计数指令方面表现不佳，经常无法准确生成指定数量的对象。本研究旨在探索扩散模型是否能够通过简单地扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成指定数量的对象。

Method: 构建了两个互补的合成计数基准数据集：GrayCount250用于受控缩放研究，NaturalCount6包含复杂自然场景。通过实证分析发现缩放假设不成立，并提出了一种通过在噪声先验中注入计数感知布局信息来控制生成对象数量的方法。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了计数准确性，在GrayCount250数据集上准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6数据集上从74.8%提升到86.3%，展示了良好的跨设置泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型倾向于依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确数量信息，噪声先验对特定对象数量存在偏好。单纯扩大模型和数据规模无法解决计数准确性问题，但通过注入计数感知布局信息可以有效控制生成对象的数量。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1 FPS，360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器解决长视频处理难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会因合并或丢弃token而丢失信息。

Method: 引入(i)测试时训练(TTT)内存模块，通过Hessian-free共轭梯度优化持续更新token表示来捕获长距离依赖；(ii)提示相关内存读取器，从固定大小内存中选择性检索上下文相关内容。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME、LVBench、VideoEvalPro)上，模型能处理10k帧和100万token的多小时视频，8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的优异表现。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S在固定内存预算下实现了高质量的长视频理解，超越了离线和流式基线方法。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，而SDF是男性生育能力评估的关键参数。需要开发非破坏性、实时的方法来检测精子DNA完整性。

Method: 提出形态学辅助集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，通过相位对比显微镜图像预测精子DNA碎片化，使用TUNEL检测作为金标准参考。

Result: 该框架实现了60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，表现出良好的检测性能。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法在生殖医学中具有重要意义，能够基于DNA完整性实现实时精子选择，为临床诊断和治疗应用提供重要进展。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMEFnet方法，通过多流形证据融合有效整合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征，解决传统方法忽视不同视图重要性和不确定性的问题，实现更可靠可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PolSAR特征融合方法简单拼接或深度学习结合，但协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同几何结构的流形上，且现有方法忽略不同视图的重要性和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示；用可信多视图证据融合替代传统softmax分类器，估计每个视图的置信质量并量化不确定性；最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合统一到一个框架中，实现了更可靠和可解释的PolSAR图像分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的感知模型，通过可微分的热图作为位置先验，将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，在多个基准数据集上达到或超越了现有最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理分割方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么用文本表示位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 提出CoPRS模型，使用可学习的位置标记聚合图像和推理文本特征生成位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器将热图解码为精确掩码，实现推理与分割的直接连接。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超越了各标准分割的最佳报告指标，在验证集和测试集上的性能均达到或超过先前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响最终掩码质量，证明了推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致性关联，该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性，在推理驱动的集中度和更精确的掩码预测方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制嵌入交互中的风格干扰来提升语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格信息）的干扰，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离语义和风格信息，但现有方法基于特征列区分无法表示它们之间的复杂耦合关系。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。通过基于性能反馈的加权函数迭代构建原型，理论证明该函数能为带来更高性能提升的原型分配更高权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上的广泛实验表明，PICO优于最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐的性能，为解决语义和风格信息的复杂耦合关系提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型在开发和部署中的巨大计算成本问题，使其在实际应用中更可行。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，使用仅1K张目标癌症病理切片将千亿级模型的知识迁移到大规模模型上。

Result: 蒸馏后的大规模模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和超大规模模型，且具有更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，可以在不承受过高计算负担的情况下为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型在语言重述和跨模态一致性方面的显著脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，理解文化背景知识变得至关重要，但现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能评估模型是否具备稳健和可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建了313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、反向文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和超过21,000个多选题实例。

Result: 发现当前VLM文化知识存在显著脆弱性，模型在语言重述下性能下降，视觉线索虽能提升性能但跨模态一致性低，特别是在资源较少地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏灵活调节关联推理强度的能力，限制了MLLM在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。需要一种机制来平衡模型的忠实性和创造性。

Method: FlexAC框架：1）发现中间层在关联行为中的关键作用；2）利用幻觉引导生成关联方向向量；3）构建自适应校准的关联导向向量；4）引入任务特定的多维度关联向量。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，有效实现了对MLLM关联推理强度的灵活控制，平衡了模型的忠实性和创造性需求。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态特征就能识别个人身份，与静态面部外观无关。使用FLAME 3D模型分离面部形状和表情动态，在1,429人的对话视频数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索面部表情动态是否包含足够的个人身份信息，独立于静态面部特征，这对社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，保留表情和下巴运动系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集的1,429人对话视频上达到61.14%的识别准确率，是随机猜测的458倍。DNR与识别性能呈强负相关，证实不稳定的形状估计会影响动态识别效果。

Conclusion: 面部表情动态包含强烈的个人身份特征，这种发现对理解社交互动和开发临床评估工具具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Motivation: 当前医学图像分割方法在结构表示和上下文建模方面存在不足，影响在复杂临床场景中的泛化能力。

Method: DTEA模型采用STR模块将多尺度语义特征重组为动态超图来建模跨分辨率解剖依赖关系，EPG模块通过扰动评估通道稳定性并过滤高熵通道来增强空间注意力。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度和更好的跨临床场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过创新的跳跃连接设计有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为微观分析提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Class Vectors方法，用于实现图像分类器的灵活编辑，包括类别遗忘、分布适应等任务，避免了传统方法需要大量重训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器在训练后难以进行后验编辑，特别是在遗忘特定类别或适应分布变化时。现有方法要么只关注错误修正，要么需要大量重训练成本，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出Class Vectors概念，通过在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。Class Vectors在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应，可以通过在潜在空间中沿这些向量引导特征，或将其映射到权重空间来更新决策边界。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效、灵活的高级概念编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其有效性，为图像分类器的灵活编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段迭代方法减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——标注者置信度的变化，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。本文旨在研究HU如何影响SFT训练，以及如何有效利用HU。

Method: 提出HaDola框架，包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练。通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息量大的样本，并从小种子集（5%数据）进行自举学习。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据就能达到或超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在SFT中显式建模HU的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD评分方法，通过重新对齐视觉-语言模态来显著提升OOD检测性能，并开发了统一的微调框架EBM，同时改善OOD泛化和检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，视觉语言模型会遇到分布内和分布外数据，其中OOD数据包含协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提升模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 基于重新对齐视觉-语言模态时观察到的显著能量变化，提出ΔEnergy评分方法。通过ΔEnergy的下界最大化（EBM）来同时改善OOD检测和泛化能力，并开发了统一的微调框架。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法10%到25%的AUROC指标。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy和EBM框架为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的OOD检测方法，同时显著提升了OOD泛化能力，理论分析表明该方法能产生域一致的Hessian矩阵，这是OOD泛化的强指标。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM虽然精度较低但无需标注。需要量化比较两种方法的成本效益，为实际部署提供指导。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，分析标准类别和罕见类别的检测性能。

Result: 监督YOLO在标准类别上准确率91.2%，零样本Gemini为68.5%；但在罕见类别上Gemini达到52.3%准确率而YOLO为0%。每正确检测成本Gemini为$0.00050，YOLO为$0.143。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署规模、类别稳定性、预算限制和精度要求，而非单纯技术指标。监督检测在超过5500万次推理时成本效益更优，零样本方法在小规模和罕见类别场景更具优势。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建中由于草图输入抽象稀疏、缺乏足够语义和几何信息而导致的挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段生成方法：1）通过草图到图像翻译进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2）引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性。

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在倒角距离、地球移动距离和F分数等指标上优于现有基于草图的3D重建方法。

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性，能够从稀疏草图中生成几何一致的3D形状。

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了SAR图像预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法对洪水模拟的影响，通过集成方法分析不同步骤和超参数选择的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对于校准和验证水力模型至关重要，但现有方法在预处理、洪水制图和深度估计各步骤中的选择和参数调优存在不确定性，需要系统评估其对最终结果的影响。

Method: 使用SAR图像对2019年和2021年加龙河两次洪水事件进行研究，采用集成方法分析不同预处理（特别是斑点噪声滤波）、洪水制图和水深估计方法的组合效果，以水动力模拟和现场观测作为参考数据。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会导致洪水范围估计出现数平方公里的变化；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优后的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可达到相似效果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深估计存在高变异性。

Conclusion: 应重视整个处理流程的集成方法，考虑方法选择的不确定性。洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，而水深估计中最关键的是洪水制图步骤的输出结果和方法的超参数设置。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet
existing datasets remain limited due to the labor-intensive process of
annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We
present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes
into simulation-ready interactive replicas with consistent geometry, enabling
direct use in diverse downstream tasks. Our contributions include: (i)
openable-object detection and segmentation to extract candidate movable parts
from static scenes, (ii) articulation estimation that infers joint types and
motion parameters, (iii) hidden-geometry completion followed by interactive
object assembly, and (iv) interactive scene integration in widely supported
formats to ensure compatibility with standard simulation platforms. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on detection/segmentation and articulation metrics
across diverse indoor scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework
and providing a practical foundation for scalable interactive scene generation,
thereby lowering the barrier to large-scale research on articulated scene

Result: 在SArena和现有基准上，InternSVG显著优于领先的开源和专有模型

Conclusion: 统一建模方法能够实现正向迁移，提升整体性能，为SVG理解、编辑和生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从组织学图像预测空间基因表达时存在两个关键限制：局部特征提取粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。

Method: 提出MMAP框架，使用多放大倍率补丁表示来增强局部特征粒度，并通过学习潜在原型嵌入来改善全局上下文理解。

Result: 实验结果表明，MMAP在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖问题，有效提升了空间转录组学中基因表达预测的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用不确定性引导的ControlNet方法，从无标签域生成带标注的合成数据，以改善跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet在生成合成数据时倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。面对新域（如Home-OCT设备）数据质量差、域偏移大的问题，需要一种方法能够生成目标域的高质量标注数据。

Method: 引入不确定性概念到控制机制中，结合来自无标签域的不确定性控制和来自有标签域的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域标注数据的ControlNet。

Result: 在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中，该方法显著改善了分割结果，无需额外监督即可实现任意域偏移。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的ControlNet能够有效生成目标域的合成标注数据，优于风格迁移方法，为跨域分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Method: 通过实验验证RL训练使MLLMs将冗余视觉表示转换为紧凑的跨域对齐文本表示，提出RALI算法使用对比学习直接对齐图像与这些文本表示

Result: RALI在质量评分任务上达到与推理型模型相当的泛化性能，但仅需不到5%的模型参数和推理时间

Conclusion: 通过消除推理过程，RALI为高质量IQA提供了更实用的解决方案，平衡了性能与效率

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法能够准确恢复光照和几何，在新型视角合成中达到最先进的渲染质量

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断和更物理的环境建模是学习准确反射的关键

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Motivation: 现有的代理工作流主要关注文本质量，忽略了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和参与度的重要性，这主要是由于缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导生成具有更强结构和样式质量的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对文档内容相同但结构和样式不同。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档，惩罚与标注排名矛盾的预测。

Conclusion: DocReward模型在评估文档结构和样式质量方面表现出色，能够有效指导生成代理产生更符合人类偏好的文档，解决了现有方法在视觉质量评估方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过创新的记忆和路由机制有效解决了ego-exo对应任务的核心挑战，为视觉指导系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将退化建模与融合过程紧密耦合，利用视觉语言模型实现了退化感知的融合性能提升。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个综合性的3D数据集，支持三种情境感知变化理解任务，包含12.1万问答对、3.6万变化描述和1.7万重排指令。该数据集基于1.1万个人类环境变化观察构建，并提出了SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准主要关注动态场景或动态情况的孤立方面，导致对动态环境的理解不完整。为了解决这一限制，需要开发能够同时处理动态场景和情境变化的数据集。

Method: 利用1.1万个人类环境变化观察构建共享心理模型和情境意识，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及空间关系。提出SCReasoner方法，这是一种高效的3D多模态大语言模型方法，能够以最小的参数开销进行点云比较，且无需语言解码器的额外标记。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的全面评估显示了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据扩展和跨领域转移的额外实验证明了Situat3DChange作为MLLMs训练数据集的任务无关有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为动态环境理解提供了重要基础，展示了在情境感知变化理解任务上的有效性，并为未来研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

TL;DR: LikePhys是一种无需训练的方法，通过使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代来评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解，在12个物理场景的基准测试中表现出与人类偏好强对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解对于构建通用物理合理世界模拟器至关重要，但由于难以在生成中区分物理正确性和视觉外观，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 引入LikePhys方法，通过在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，来区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Result: 提出的评估指标PPE在12个物理场景的基准测试中与人类偏好强对齐，优于现有评估基线。系统基准测试显示模型容量和推理设置扩展时物理理解能力有明显改善趋势。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现明显改善趋势，LikePhys为评估直觉物理理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走的挑战，由于缺乏全面的场景理解能力。

Method: 构建包含120条手动控制、场景分类的行走轨迹的多模态数据集，包含62k同步帧和559k全景图像（RGB、深度和语义模态），并生成包含69k视觉问答三元组的VQA基准测试。

Result: 评估发现现有视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务上表现不佳，但基于mmWalk微调的模型在真实世界数据集上表现出有效性。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集为推进多模态行走辅助技术提供了有效支持，特别是在处理户外极端情况和无障碍特定地标方面。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了DiT中的大规模激活现象，发现其调节局部细节合成，并提出Detail Guidance方法增强细节保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer中的大规模激活现象功能尚不明确，需要系统研究其在视觉生成中的作用

Method: 提出Detail Guidance策略，通过构建"细节缺失"模型来引导原始网络进行高质量细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成

Result: 实验证明DG能持续提升各种预训练DiT的细粒度细节质量

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，DG方法能有效增强DiT的细节生成能力

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: 本文提出了ODI-Bench，一个专门用于全方位图像理解的综合基准，包含2000张高质量全方位图像和4000多个手动标注的问答对。实验表明当前多模态大语言模型在理解全方位图像方面仍存在困难，作者进一步提出了Omni-CoT方法，通过跨文本和视觉线索的思维链推理显著提升模型理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全方位图像提供360x180度的完整视角，广泛应用于VR、AR和具身智能应用。然而，多模态大语言模型在理解全方位图像捕获的沉浸式环境方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1) 构建ODI-Bench基准，包含2000张全方位图像和4000多个QA对，涵盖10个细粒度任务；2) 对20个代表性MLLM进行基准测试；3) 提出Omni-CoT方法，通过跨文本和视觉线索的思维链推理增强模型理解能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前MLLM在捕捉全方位图像提供的沉浸式上下文方面仍存在困难。Omni-CoT方法显著提升了MLLM在全方位环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 本文填补了全方位图像理解领域的空白，提出的基准和方法为未来研究提供了重要基础，有助于推动VR、AR和具身智能应用中全方位图像理解技术的发展。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: 该研究通过幂律拟合方法预测胸部X光分类任务中达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的标注样本数量，发现XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP等基础模型相比ResNet-50基线能在更少标注样本下实现强性能，且仅需50个标注病例就能准确预测最终性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光分类任务通常需要大量标注数据，基础模型虽然能减少这种依赖，但具体需要多少标注样本才能达到特定性能阈值尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估使用幂律拟合来预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练规模，测试了多种病理类型和基础模型，并与ResNet-50基线进行比较。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP在显著少于ResNet-50基线标注样本的情况下实现了强性能，且仅使用50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使实践者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本，为医疗影像分析提供了高效的资源分配策略。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

TL;DR: SNAP是一个统一的交互式3D点云分割模型，支持跨域的点基和文本提示分割，通过多数据集训练和领域自适应归一化实现通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云分割方法局限于单一领域和单一交互方式，多数据集训练容易产生负迁移，缺乏通用性。

Method: 使用7个数据集进行跨域训练，采用领域自适应归一化防止负迁移；文本提示分割通过自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP嵌入匹配实现。

Result: 在9个零样本基准测试中8个达到SOTA性能，在5个文本提示基准测试中表现优异，超越专业领域特定方法。

Conclusion: 统一模型可以匹配或超越专业领域特定方法，为可扩展3D标注提供实用工具。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，能够将合成数据集快速适配到特定目标域，生成高质量的真实感图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型的下游性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模和场景设计，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签对目标域进行适配。该方法能够从任何合成数据集的语义图中生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，并过滤次优生成、纠正图像标签不对齐问题，以及标准化跨数据集的语义。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升了高达8.0%的mIoU，使得快速构建的合成数据集能够与需要大量手动设计的高成本合成数据集相媲美。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，即快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: 结果表明模型架构对于跨地理区域和传感器平台的强泛化能力至关重要。这项研究为操作化高光谱作物制图提供了基础模型的系统评估，并为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational

Motivation: 多模态情感分析面临标注数据稀缺的问题，而传统的Mixup数据增强方法直接应用于多模态场景时会放大标签模糊和语义不一致的挑战，需要情感感知的混合机制。

Method: 提出MS-Mix框架，包含三个核心组件：情感感知样本选择策略防止矛盾情感样本混合；情感强度引导模块动态计算模态特异性混合比例；情感对齐损失函数通过KL散度正则化联合训练情感强度预测器和骨干网络。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进骨干网络上的实验表明，MS-Mix持续优于现有方法，为稳健的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感敏感的混合机制有效解决了多模态数据增强中的语义一致性问题，显著提升了多模态情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法存在泛化能力不足的问题，当查询图像的成像条件与训练视图差异过大时容易失败。这是因为传统方法的设计导致回归器对训练视图过拟合。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上进行预训练，训练变换器从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: ACE-G通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示的方法，成功解决了传统SCR方法的泛化限制，为视觉重定位提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解方面的真实能力。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三级任务层次（细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理），结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLM发现，虽然它们在粗粒度识别表现出色，但在区分细粒度细节、跟踪状态变化和连接实验过程与科学结果方面表现不佳，专有模型与开源模型存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够成为科学实验可信赖伙伴的MLLM指明了发展路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: NV3D是一种用于自动驾驶3D目标检测的新方法，通过提取体素邻居的法向量特征来增强检测性能，并提出了两种采样策略来减少数据量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D目标检测方法面临多模态特征对齐困难和局部特征提取过于简化的问题，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 提出NV3D模型，利用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量特征，采用法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略减少数据量，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，NV3D在汽车和骑车人检测上表现优异，无采样时分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线Voxel R-CNN分别提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样策略后仍能保持85.54% mAP，同时过滤掉约55%的体素。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能够有效提升3D目标检测性能，提出的采样策略在保持性能的同时显著减少了计算量，为复杂3D检测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建物理合理的人-场景交互和接触的框架，通过联合优化人体姿态、相机参数和全局尺度，解决深度模糊、遮挡和物理不一致接触问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从单张图像重建人类及其周围场景时面临深度模糊、遮挡和物理不一致接触的挑战，限制了虚拟现实、机器人和3D场景理解的应用。

Method: PhySIC从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何体构建稳健的度量支架，合成缺失的支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合强制执行深度对齐、接触先验、穿透避免和2D重投影一致性。

Conclusion: PhySIC通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解，能够自然处理多个人类并重建多样化的交互。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有的自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型的真实决策过程对齐，从而损害了解释的忠实性

Method: 提出FACE框架，在非负矩阵分解(NMF)基础上增加KL散度正则化项，在概念学习过程中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估显示，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法

Conclusion: FACE通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，弥合了低层特征与高层语义之间的鸿沟

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Result: 在SOPE、ROPE、ObjaversePose和HANDAL四个基准测试中达到最先进精度，对未见过的真实世界物体表现出强大的零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出用表示自编码器（RAE）替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器（DiT）的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE的局限性，并在ImageNet上取得了优异的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器普遍使用VAE编码器存在三个主要问题：过时的骨干网络架构、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、纯重建训练导致的弱表示质量。这些限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练的表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器（RAE），并针对高维潜在空间设计了轻量级宽DDT头来优化扩散变换器的训练效率。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得显著成果：无引导时256×256分辨率FID为1.51，有引导时256×256和512×512分辨率FID均为1.13。

Conclusion: RAE相比传统VAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准配置。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种新颖的混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和更鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

Motivation: 现有全景图像生成方法主要关注模型设计，而缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据，导致生成质量在几何保真度和真实感方面存在不足。

Method: DiT360采用多级模块设计，包括图像级的跨域知识融合（透视图像引导和全景细化）和标记级的混合监督（圆形填充、偏航损失和立方体损失），在预VAE图像级和后VAE标记级进行域间转换和域内增强。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在十一个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的几何保真度和真实感，为全景图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置一个独特颜色的标记，然后从中间噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，从而在帧间传播标记点轨迹。为了确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见，使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示。

Result: 通过多个图像条件视频扩散模型的实验发现，这种"涌现"的跟踪效果优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型能够有效执行零样本点跟踪任务，这种方法在跟踪准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出色，证明了生成模型在运动分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了第一个针对基于大视觉语言模型（LVLM）的Web代理的全面安全评估基准tool{}，包含6个模拟Web环境、2970个高质量轨迹和6种攻击向量，通过三层评估协议分析9个代表性LVLM模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全评估基准覆盖范围有限，通常仅限于用户级提示操作等狭窄场景，无法全面捕捉代理漏洞。需要设计一个全面的基准来评估LVLM-based Web代理的安全风险。

Method: 1）构建统一评估套件：6个模拟现实Web环境，2970个高质量轨迹；2）定义6种攻击向量分类（用户级和环境级操作）；3）设计三层评估协议（内部推理、行为轨迹、任务结果）；4）对9个代表性LVLM进行大规模实验。

Result: 所有测试的代理都对细微的对抗性操作表现出持续脆弱性，揭示了模型专业化与安全性之间的关键权衡。不同类型的LVLM模型在安全性方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: tool{}基准为推进可信Web代理部署奠定了基础，提供了全面的基准套件和多层评估管道，以及关于现代LVLM-based Web代理安全挑战的实证见解。

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ArtPerception是一个新颖的黑盒越狱框架，利用ASCII艺术绕过先进LLM的安全措施，通过两阶段方法实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐主要关注语义解释，对非标准数据表示存在漏洞，需要防御多模态解释空间的安全威胁。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段进行模型特定的预测试确定ASCII艺术识别最佳参数；第二阶段基于这些洞察发起高效的单次恶意越狱攻击。

Result: 在四个先进开源LLM上展示优越的越狱性能，成功迁移到GPT-4o、Claude Sonnet 3.7等商业模型，并能有效对抗LLaMA Guard等防御措施。

Conclusion: 真正的LLM安全需要防御文本输入内的多模态解释空间，基于侦察的战略攻击具有显著效果。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了两种跨传感器触觉图像生成方法：Touch2Touch（端到端）和T2D2（通过深度中间表示），解决不同触觉传感器间的通用表示问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前触觉传感器形状尺寸各异，导致模型依赖特定传感器设计，难以开发通用触觉表示

Method: 1. Touch2Touch：基于配对数据的端到端方法；2. T2D2：构建深度中间表示，无需配对数据

Result: 在手掌姿态估计和行为克隆等下游任务中，成功将训练于一个传感器的模型迁移到另一个传感器

Conclusion: 两种方法为传感器转换提供了灵活解决方案，可根据数据可用性和应用需求选择

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能体在真实环境部署后无法获取新知识来提升任务性能的根本限制

Method: 使用经验反馈网络(EFN)，通过检索成功执行记忆来增强冻结的视觉-语言-动作策略，采用基于语义相似度奖励的强化学习来确保预测动作与当前观察下的成功行为一致

Result: 在多样化具身任务实验中，EFN显著提升了适应性、鲁棒性和成功率

Conclusion: Dejavu框架为实现具身智能体在部署后持续优化行为提供了一条有前景的路径

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Method: 提出新颖的软提示方法，为每个数据源引入可学习的嵌入作为具身特定提示，基于流匹配的简洁VLA架构，仅使用软提示的标准Transformer编码器

Result: 0.9B参数的X-VLA模型在多个基准测试中同时达到SOTA性能，在灵活性、快速适应跨具身、环境和任务方面表现出色

Conclusion: 软提示方法有效利用了跨具身特征，X-VLA架构兼具可扩展性和简洁性，为通用VLA模型的发展提供了新思路

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B
instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep
of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities,
from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments,

TL;DR: SuperEx框架将非视距(NLOS)传感集成到机器人探索中，使用单光子LiDAR通过时间直方图探测隐藏物体，在低覆盖率下提高12%的建图精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前机器人感知局限于视线范围的问题，当环境布局偏离先验假设时，物理遍历导致探索效率低下。

Method: 集成NLOS传感到建图-探索循环中：(i)从时间直方图中剔除空NLOS区域；(ii)通过基于物理和数据驱动的两步方法重建占据结构，利用结构规律性。

Result: 在复杂模拟地图和真实KTH Floorplan数据集上评估，在<30%覆盖率下建图精度提升12%，探索效率优于视线基线方法。

Conclusion: SuperEx为超越直接可见性的可靠建图开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Motivation: 传统机器人抓取系统依赖将传感器数据转换为显式3D点云，这与生物智能不同。本文探索一种根本不同的神经启发范式

Method: 使用立体脉冲相机的原始异步事件，通过循环脉冲神经网络融合立体脉冲流并迭代优化抓取假设，无需重建点云

Result: 实验表明SpikeGrasp超越传统点云基线，在杂乱和无纹理场景中表现优异，并展示出卓越的数据效率

Conclusion: 通过验证这种端到端神经启发方法的可行性，SpikeGrasp为未来实现自然界中流畅高效操作的系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测环境下规划时，先验信息至关重要但难以获取，需要一种能够捕捉环境不确定性和空间语义关系的方法。

Method: 使用预训练生成模型，基于部分观测生成完整的RGB-D点云样本，包含占用率和目标语义信息，可直接用于配置空间规划。

Result: 在Matterport3D基准测试中，该方法能够恢复与真实情况一致的常识性空间语义，生成多样化、干净的3D点云，可用于运动规划。

Conclusion: 生成模型为机器人规划提供了丰富的先验信息来源，展示了在部分可观测环境下的有效应用前景。

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Motivation: 开发通用自主的机器人舀取策略具有挑战性，因为需要处理复杂的工具-物体交互，特别是涉及可变形物体（如颗粒介质或液体）时，其无限维配置空间和复杂动力学使得问题更加困难。

Method: 使用OmniGibson模拟器收集基于特权状态信息的舀取示范，然后通过扩散模型学习生成策略来模仿这些示范。方法包括模拟数据收集和扩散策略学习两个主要步骤。

Conclusion: SCOOP'D是获取机器人舀取技能的有前景的方法，证明了通过模拟学习和扩散模型可以有效地处理复杂的机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

Conclusion: UltraScatter为基于波动方程的方法提供了一个可扩展的替代方案，能够高效且真实地模拟超声散射。

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically,
achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster
alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain
relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode
image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that
models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is
represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering
amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking.
Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information
incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave
imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces
B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic
speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable
alternative to wave-based methods.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
(CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
environments.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过精确感知和定位多图像中的问题相关证据，并基于证据推导最终答案，显著提高了答案准确性，类似于真实侦探的推理过程。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by

localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

TL;DR: BitMar是一种量化多模态Transformer，通过1.58位编码器和外部类人情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨注意力Transformer等多模态视觉语言模型在边缘设备部署时面临的内存和计算资源限制问题，同时结合记忆增强架构的优势。

Method: 使用1.58位文本编码器（BitNet风格）和视觉编码器（DiNOv2基础），生成紧凑嵌入并查询固定大小的键值情景记忆。解码器采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制处理长序列输入。

Result: 在低延迟和小模型占用下实现了竞争力的图像描述和多模态理解性能，达到了良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署，为资源受限环境下的多模态生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础框架来评估视觉语言模型在胸部X光视觉问答中的思维链解释的忠实性，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因和保真度方面优于开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的思维链解释往往听起来合理但未能反映实际决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任。现有评估方法很少能发现这种不一致性，主要关注答案准确性或格式一致性。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改，在三个维度上评估思维链忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准。进行了读者研究（n=4）并比较了六个视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在观察到的放射科医生间差异范围内，归因一致性最强（τ_b=0.670），保真度中等（τ_b=0.387），置信度校准较弱（τ_b=0.091）。专有模型在归因（25.0% vs. 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs. 31.7%）方面优于开源模型。

Conclusion: 答案准确性与解释质量脱节，承认注入线索并不能确保基础性，文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释。需要超越最终答案准确性的评估方法来识别部署风险。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的语言中心全模态嵌入框架LCO-Emb，通过分析发现MLLM在生成预训练中实现了隐式跨模态对齐，使对比学习可作为轻量级精炼阶段。实验证明该方法在多种基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并提出了生成-表示缩放定律（GRSL）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的多模态嵌入方法虽然表现出色，但其优越性的根本原因尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在揭示MLLM在生成预训练中实现的隐式跨模态对齐是其优势的关键因素。

Method: 提出LCO-Emb框架，利用MLLM在生成预训练中获得的隐式跨模态对齐，将对比学习作为轻量级精炼阶段。通过各向异性和核相似性结构分析验证潜在对齐的存在。

Result: 在多样化骨干网络和基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LCO-Emb实现了跨模态的SOTA性能。验证了GRSL定律，证明生成能力的提升可有效增强表示质量。

Conclusion: 提高生成能力是增强表示质量的有效范式。理论分析表明MLLM的生成质量与其表示性能上限存在正式联系，在低资源视觉-文档检索任务上验证了持续生成预训练可进一步提升嵌入能力。

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: 提出了GradFix方法，通过分析新模型梯度符号结构来跨模型迁移任务向量，仅需少量标注样本即可实现知识迁移，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型新版本发布时，传统方法需要重复完整微调，而现有任务向量方法因参数空间不对齐而跨模型迁移失败。

Method: 基于梯度符号结构分析，提出GradFix方法：计算目标模型少量梯度，根据梯度符号结构掩码源任务向量，实现局部对齐目标损失景观。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中取得显著性能提升，优于朴素任务向量加法和少样本微调。

Conclusion: 梯度符号结构是成功迁移的关键，GradFix方法提供理论保证且实验效果优异，为跨模型知识迁移提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性噪声算子，将结构化频率对角协方差引入扩散概率模型，以更好地适应目标数据分布，从而提升生成性能并实现选择性忽略已知的特定频带损坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然大多是隐式的。本文旨在将归纳偏置明确地构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应目标数据分布。

Method: 引入了各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性前向协方差，统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定的频率带，同时保持前向过程为高斯分布。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系，并证明了在完全支持的情况下，学习到的得分会收敛到真实数据得分。

Result: 实验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性忽略：在学习过程中忽略已知的特定频带损坏。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在扩散概率模型中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的调节手段。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度监督跨模态哈希方法虽然通过自监督学习语义信息取得了成功，但多标签语义提取过程未能显式地与原始多模态数据交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态差距的弥合

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，重新表述为一组真实标签提示，描述图像中呈现的语义。设计跨模态教师网络，有效蒸馏图像和标签模态之间的跨模态语义特征，为图像模态学习良好映射的汉明空间，作为先验知识指导学生网络学习

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，能够更好地保持图像和文本模态之间的语义相似性，有效提升跨模态哈希性能

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: NCAL-R是一个基于神经崩溃几何的可靠主动学习框架，通过几何稳定性信号来缓解噪声标签和数据分布偏移问题，在减少标注成本的同时提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在存在标注噪声或数据分布偏移时不可靠，因为常用的不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标注或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 提出两种互补信号：类均值对齐扰动分数（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动分数（捕捉训练过程中表征的时间不稳定性），通过结合这些信号来选择既保持类间分离又突出模糊区域的样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下具有更高鲁棒性，对分布外数据有更强泛化能力，以更少标签实现更高准确率。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入主动学习样本选择过程，可以减少对标注错误和分布偏移的脆弱性，是实现真实世界标注管道中可信部署的关键一步。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机制可解释性研究旨在揭示神经网络内部组件如何产生预测，但长期存在可解码性和因果性概念混淆的问题。本研究旨在厘清两者在视觉Transformer中的关系。

Method: 使用激活修补技术，通过移植干净-损坏图像对之间的激活来测试空间和CLS token的因果作用；同时训练线性探针评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 发现系统性不匹配：中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性；最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性；CLS token在中间层可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——信息存在vs信息使用，两者的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，无法获得可解释的语义分解。需要一种能够自动将输入分解为多个有语义意义组件的模型。

Method: 使用N个并行分支，每个分支处理原始信号减去其他分支重建结果的残差。通过展开Gauss-Seidel块坐标下降法构建可微分网络，强制组件间竞争。

Result: 实现了稀疏且语义明确的表示分解，是第一个实现"全除一"残差更新规则的语义自编码器。

Conclusion: DecompNet在可解释性分解方面优于线性分解方法和现有对象中心架构，为语义分解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优点，在保持性能的同时解决了参数过多的问题，为序列建模提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain

*Yuval Golbari,Navve Wasserman,Gal Vardi,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于隐式偏差的白盒成员推理攻击方法，通过KKT最优条件识别训练样本，无需依赖参考模型或强假设条件，在现实场景中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒MIA方法依赖不现实的假设条件（如已知训练超参数、非训练样本同分布、训练数据比例已知），这些假设在实际场景中很少成立，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 利用神经网络的最大边际隐式偏差理论，通过KKT最优条件找到梯度能最强重构模型参数的样本，从而识别训练数据。这是一种白盒攻击方法，需要模型权重和训练数据的超集。

Result: ImpMIA在现实场景下（仅模型权重和训练数据超集可用）相比黑盒和白盒攻击方法都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过消除对参考模型和强假设的依赖，为成员推理攻击提供了一种更实用的白盒解决方案，特别适用于当前模型权重公开可用的现实环境。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)的方法，通过渐进式深度扩展策略来平衡模型深度与任务复杂度，避免在简单数据集上使用过深网络造成的资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在简单数据集上使用过深架构会导致计算资源浪费、内存占用过大和能源消耗过高，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 提出渐进式深度扩展训练策略：从较浅深度开始训练，随着前面模块收敛逐步增加网络深度，直到达到目标精度，只保留最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别减少了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够显著降低模型的内存占用和计算成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习虽然取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率

Method: 定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效本征维度与环境维度的比值，使用Fisher信息矩阵的谱特性推导有效维度

Result: 理论分析证明Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵推向单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，达到最优表示效率(η=1)

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EasyCore的核集选择方法，通过保留训练过程中平均输入梯度范数（AIGN）较低的简单样本来提升模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的核集选择方法主要针对干净准确率设计，在保持对抗鲁棒性方面表现不足。需要从数据中心的视角理解哪些输入样本对学习鲁棒特征最为关键。

Method: 提出了EasyCore框架，将样本的对抗脆弱性与其硬度（通过AIGN量化）联系起来。选择AIGN值较低的简单样本进行训练，这些样本更不易受攻击且远离决策边界。

Result: 实验表明，使用EasyCore选择的核集训练的模型在标准训练和对抗训练下，对抗准确率分别比现有核集方法提高了7%和5%。

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著提升对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

TL;DR: 提出MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现高效准确的热成像FLD模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在挑战性光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态方法计算成本高或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏（MLCM-KD）框架，包含双向注入知识蒸馏（DIKD）机制，建立RGB和热成像模态间的连接，通过闭环监督确保语义一致性

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架成功解决了热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异挑战，实现了鲁棒且高效的知识迁移

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个结合NVFP4量化和LoRA的强化学习框架，旨在解决LLM强化学习中的资源消耗问题，同时通过量化噪声增强探索能力，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的强化学习训练需要大量GPU内存和长时间rollout，资源消耗大，限制了大规模模型的训练效率。

Method: 采用NVFP4量化与LoRA结合，减少内存开销并加速rollout阶段；引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声。

Result: 在单张H100 80GB GPU上成功训练32B LLM，rollout阶段速度提升1.5倍以上；在7B模型上，GSM8K达到90.8%，MATH 500达到77.4%，性能与全参数微调相当。

Conclusion: QeRL是LLM强化学习的高效框架，既提升了训练速度，又通过量化噪声增强了探索能力，实现了资源消耗与性能的平衡。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是特征叠加现象，而非传统认为的决策边界不规则或非鲁棒特征敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对抗性样本产生原因存在争议，要么归因于决策边界的不规则性，要么归因于对非鲁棒特征的敏感性。本文旨在从信息编码角度提供新的解释框架。

Method: 通过理论分析特征叠加现象（网络用较少维度表示较多特征），在可控合成环境中验证叠加导致对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10训练的ViT模型上进行实证验证。

Result: 证明对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰效应，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测；发现模型间对抗攻击可迁移性和类别特异性漏洞模式；证实叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入问题，这为理解对抗性样本提供了新的机制性解释。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

TL;DR: CLoD-GS是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的连续细节层次方法，通过可学习的距离相关衰减参数实现单模型内的平滑质量缩放，解决了传统离散LoD方法的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散LoD方法需要存储多个模型副本且会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，影响用户体验。新兴的3D高斯泼溅技术为连续LoD提供了理想基础。

Method: 为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，配合渲染点数量正则化。

Result: CLoD-GS实现了单模型内的平滑质量缩放渲染，消除了离散方法的存储开销和视觉伪影，同时减少了基元数量和内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在3D高斯泼溅框架中实现连续LoD的可行性，为实时图形渲染提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

Conclusion: 该方法可无缝集成到现有扩散管道中，提供了一种实用的途径来生成超越文本描述限制的创造性输出。

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

Conclusion: MTMD框架有效统一了多任务多领域的广告推荐优化，实现了知识共享和迁移，显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before
the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad
recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization
tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads
and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces
where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with
diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging
problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight
ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's
value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple
goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization
goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different
surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn
domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains
to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture
under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1)
handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a
unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn
both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between
domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer
between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD
improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction
in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production
for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural
compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains
challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression,
where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural
video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by
the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video
Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression.
GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a
perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints
from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture
explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior
neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified
intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results
across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance
in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC
rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while
maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical
perceptual video compression.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages
compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable
high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The
framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated
splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar
appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to
capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.
This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,
enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the
sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,
consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal
bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming
canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating
temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting
compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream
multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive
multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique
for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However,
existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks
standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source
FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters.
Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for
a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression
efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and
encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally
lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is
merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a
robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and
efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source
implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin
nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of
nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared
to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration,
pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light
efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present
an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several
times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration
framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a
lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion
algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced
distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures.
Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image
restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for
deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.
