TL;DR: 2COOOL workshop聚焦于自动驾驶中的新场景处理，旨在通过多领域方法提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶尚未完全安全，关键挑战在于处理新场景和未知危险。

Method: 结合异常检测、开放集识别、视觉语言模型等方法，开发新算法。

Result: 提供一个学术与工业界合作的平台，推动自动驾驶安全技术发展。

Conclusion: 2COOOL工作坊旨在激发创新，解决自动驾驶中的新场景挑战。

Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了深度学习在牙科全景X光图像自动分类中的应用，比较了三种方法，发现混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过深度学习提高牙科X光图像中常见病变的自动分类准确性，以支持临床诊断。

Method: 使用1,512张X光图像和11,137个专家标注，评估了自定义CNN、混合模型（CNN+传统分类器）和预训练模型（如VGG16）。

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型以85.4%的准确率表现最佳，优于自定义CNN（74.3%）和预训练模型（如VGG16的82.3%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型在区分形态相似病变上表现优异，为牙科自动诊断提供了实用路径，但需更大数据集和临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Q-Align方法，通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，提升语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本外观迁移在大规模图像生成模型中面临注意力泄漏的挑战，影响语义映射的准确性。

Method: Q-Align包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和注意力细化，以优化语义对齐和特征对应。

Result: 实验表明Q-Align在外观保真度上优于现有方法，同时保持结构一致性。

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，提升了零样本外观迁移的性能。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一种创新的缓存框架，通过联合纠正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差，显著加速扩散模型的推理过程，同时保持或提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，现有缓存策略在重用中间输出时往往导致质量下降。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架，包括离线残差分析、动态调整积分间隔和残差线性化模型，以联合纠正缓存引入的误差。

Result: 在图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了2倍推理加速，且视觉质量保持或提升。

Conclusion: ERTACache在保持基线保真度的同时显著提升效率，适用于高性能扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)的任务，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来优化视频问答和指令调优数据，显著提升了视频语言理解的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）由于稀疏帧采样和帧间推理监督不足，难以捕捉细粒度的时间语义。

Method: TVS通过保留关键视频片段、同步重构查询并保持答案一致性，作为模块化前端适配器任务，无缝集成到视频指令调优和视频问答流程中。

Result: TVS在训练和推理阶段分别实现了7.33%和34.6%的相对增益，并在视频修剪任务中F-1分数提升了0.47。

Conclusion: TVS通过时间信息筛选有效提升了视频语言理解能力，为视频问答和指令调优提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于骨骼姿态标注的手术工具定位方法，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集和标注工具，以促进该标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术工具定位方法依赖于分割任务，但受限于标注数据的多样性。骨骼姿态标注在语义丰富性和标注效率之间取得了平衡。

Method: 通过ROBUST-MIPS数据集结合工具姿态和实例分割标注，并利用姿态估计方法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明姿态标注在手术工具定位中表现优异，并发布了数据集和工具以促进研究。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是一种高效的手术工具定位方法，ROBUST-MIPS数据集为相关研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种创新的即插即用安全补丁，旨在减少T2I模型中的不安全内容生成，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型的安全机制易受规避或需要大量调整，无法灵活应对不断变化的安全需求。

Method: 通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，将安全控制信号注入锁定的T2I模型，以补丁形式更新。

Result: 在六种T2I模型上评估，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，优于基线方法的20%。

Conclusion: Safe-Control有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐，兼容类似去噪架构的T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一种新方法，用于从自然语言指令和移动设备的前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域的位置，特别针对边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域、无目标或多目标时表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: GENNAV通过预测目标存在性并生成多个stuff-type目标区域的分割掩码来解决这一问题。

Result: GENNAV在GRiN-Drive基准测试中表现优于基线方法，并在真实世界实验中展示了零样本迁移性能的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，适用于多样化的真实世界环境。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，通过双模式退火和策略优化，根据问题复杂度决定是否激活思考过程，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在简单问题上冗余的思考过程导致效率低下，需要一种自适应机制来优化。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练模型，结合改进的GRPO框架进行策略优化，使模型能自适应选择思考或非思考模式。

Result: R-4B在25个基准测试中表现优异，超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，并与更大模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制有效平衡了性能与效率，为MLLMs的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个融合RGB、热成像和深度数据的框架，通过Mamba-based融合机制提升遮挡或伪装目标的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等复杂条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的多模态方法。

Method: 提出HiddenObject框架，集成RGB、热成像和深度数据，通过Mamba-based机制融合多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，性能达到或超越现有方法，揭示了当前单模态和简单融合策略的局限性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构在多模态目标检测领域具有潜力，尤其在视觉退化或复杂条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一种新型框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，解决了CT/X射线配准中的高精度和实时性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在空间信息丢失和领域差距方面存在问题，且现有方法对密集视图和噪声X射线敏感。

Method: RadGS-Reg结合了基于学习的辐射高斯重建和反事实注意力学习机制，并采用患者特定的预训练策略。

Result: 在内部数据集上表现出最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg为CT/X射线配准提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个包含620万合成3D住宅建筑的多模态数据集，支持生成AI算法开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型仍具挑战性。

Method: 数据集包含三种模态：LoD 4的3D线框图、平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。

Result: 数据集支持开发自动化生成LoD 4的3D建筑模型的算法。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为未来研究提供了多模态数据支持，推动3D建筑模型生成技术的发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的方法来解决三种不同配置的径向畸变与单应性估计问题，新方法在速度和准确性上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实图像常受镜头畸变影响，需同时估计单应性和径向畸变，但现有方法仅针对特定配置，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种统一的方法，适用于三种径向畸变配置（单图像畸变、相同畸变、独立畸变），并构建了快速、稳定的最小求解器。

Result: 新求解器在所有三种情况下均比现有技术更快，同时保持相似准确性，并在鱼眼相机图像等基准测试中验证了性能。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一种高效且通用的方法，解决了单应性与径向畸变联合估计的问题，为计算机视觉任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量（GCAV）框架，通过对比学习和注意力机制统一不同层的CAV，减少不一致性，提升概念解释的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独立计算的CAV在不同层间存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，并通过注意力机制融合构建全局CAV（GCAV）。

Result: 实验表明，GCAV显著减少了TCAV分数的方差，增强了概念定位和对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息，提供了更全面、可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

Method: 利用LLM推断语义规则，指导视觉基础模型提取ID敏感特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K和多个ReID基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: VICP为跨类别ReID提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的新方法。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

### [16] [Lightweight MRI-Based Automated Segmentation of Pancreatic Cancer with Auto3DSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21227)
*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用SegResNet模型在MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务中进行了评估，结果显示不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响，强调了标准化大数据集的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型，通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在两种MRI序列（T1和T2）的数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: Task 1的DSC为0.56，Task 2降至0.33，表明不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 尽管性能一般，研究展示了自动化分割的潜力，并强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集以提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理学的数据增强和领域适应方法，通过推断MRI图像的潜在自旋属性，解决了心脏MRI分割模型的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MRI图像对比度因成像协议不同而变化，导致预训练分割模型难以泛化。

Method: 通过解决非线性逆问题，从MRI图像中推断自旋属性，并利用扩散模型学习自旋先验分布。

Result: 方法能够从任意新序列合成图像，显著提高了分割模型在不同对比度和协议下的准确性。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging实现了心脏MRI分割模型的广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过利用用户特定形状信息提高视频中的姿态估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法通常忽略用户特定体型和3D姿态的合理性，导致3D准确性不足。PHD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PHD首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用Point Diffusion Transformer实现体型条件化的3D姿态先验。

Result: PHD不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态的准确性，还改善了绝对姿态准确性，且仅需合成数据训练。

Conclusion: PHD是一种高效且通用的方法，可无缝集成到现有3D姿态估计器中提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态时计算成本高，需要优化。

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝策略（HTP），包括时间相关性增强剪枝（TCEP）、稀疏聚焦时间MHSA（SFT MHSA）和掩码引导姿态令牌剪枝器（MGPTP）。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP显著减少了计算量和推理时间，同时保持高性能。

Conclusion: HTP框架在计算效率和性能上均优于现有扩散模型方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume框架通过2D指纹生成合成3D OCT指纹数据，解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT数据获取成本高且耗时，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习模型的发展。

Method: 框架包括2D风格转换、3D结构扩展网络和OCT真实性细化模块，生成高质量合成数据。

Result: 生成42万样本数据集，预训练模型在真实数据集上EER从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume有效克服数据稀缺问题，显著提升指纹识别性能。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 当前手动分析手术录像耗时且效率低，需要更先进的计算机视觉和机器学习方法，但缺乏相关样本数据。

Method: 通过合作医学专家创建了首个包含子宫内膜异位症区域标注的图像数据集GLENDA。

Result: GLENDA数据集填补了该领域样本数据的空白，为后续研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集有望推动妇科腹腔镜手术中计算机视觉和机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录了手术的每一个细节，但自动内容索引仍是一个挑战，尤其是在特殊的手术视频内容中。

Method: 采用基于区域的完全卷积网络进行实例感知分割（区分器械与背景）和多类器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本较少，也能高精度定位和分割器械区域，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 手术器械的高相似性使得类型识别困难，但分割任务表现良好。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Result: 通过具体案例展示了该标准在WSI目录、机器学习和图表示中的优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为WSI提供了细粒度内容信息，提升了互操作性和应用效率。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Motivation: 现实场景中，新类别常出现在未标记数据中，而现有增量学习方法依赖全标记数据，不切实际。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，并将其集成到多种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择优化性能。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，ICPL在最终准确率上优于现有class-iNCD方法5%以上。

Conclusion: ICPL在无监督增量学习中表现优异，适用于资源受限环境，且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Conclusion: MedShift为医学影像中的领域适应提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Result: 实验表明，\M在视觉质量上优于现有方法，同时显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: \M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合特征截断和评分函数的多方法集成（MME）评分，显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注单一技术或特定OOD数据集，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 通过理论和实证证明，将最先进的特征截断和评分函数有效结合，并聚合多个评分函数以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MME显著优于现有方法，如在ImageNet-1K上FPR95降低6%。

Conclusion: MME通过结合多种技术，显著提升了OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有基于DNN的船舶检测技术易受对抗补丁攻击，传统数据增强方法可能因过度增强背景或非目标区域引入干扰，导致误检。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅增强目标区域，避免背景干扰，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，显著提升了对抗补丁攻击的效果。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLMs）在视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。特别是长视频中语义复杂性增加，导致语义聚合幻觉（SAH）问题突出，需要系统研究。

Method: 作者提出了ELV-Halluc基准，用于系统研究SAH。通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂性的关系，并探讨了缓解SAH的方法，包括改进位置编码策略和采用DPO策略。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并发现SAH随语义复杂性增加而增加。模型在语义快速变化时更容易产生SAH。通过改进位置编码和DPO策略，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME上取得了显著改进，SAH比率降低了27.7%。

Conclusion: 论文首次系统研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了ELV-Halluc基准和缓解SAH的方法，为未来视频多模态大语言模型的改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Result: 上采样后的特征能够分离难以分割的相（如细裂纹），交互式分割速度快且标签需求少。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了显微镜图像分割的效率和质量，优于传统卷积网络。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Method: 提出HCCM框架，包括区域-全局图像-文本对比学习（RG-ITC）和匹配学习（RG-ITM），以及动量对比与蒸馏机制（MCD）。

Result: 在GeoText-1652和ERA数据集上，HCCM实现了最先进的检索性能，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: HCCM通过层次化跨粒度学习，显著提升了无人机场景中的视觉-语言理解能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的方法，通过单张图像重建完整的3D场景，包括遮挡部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要密集观测且无法重建遮挡和未观测区域，回归方法预测单一模式导致模糊和不合理。

Method: 使用变分自重构器学习2D图像的潜在空间，并训练扩散模型生成多样化的3D高斯泼溅表示。

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建和多样样本，完成遮挡区域的高质量360度渲染。

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法解决了单图像3D重建的挑战，尤其在遮挡区域的表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 解决传统成对比较方法标注成本高的问题，利用CLIP模型和自动化比较提升效率。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP模型进行零样本预排序；2. 初始化基于桶的Elo分数；3. 运行不确定性引导的MergeSort。

Result: 在多个数据集上，EZ-Sort将人工标注成本降低90.5%（相比全比较）和19.8%（相比先前工作）。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验和不确定性采样，提供了一种高效且可扩展的成对排序解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Result: ECHO在egocentric HOI重建中表现优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出从最小观察中恢复三种模态的统一框架，具有灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Motivation: 医学影像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法多局限于单一时间点或特定任务。

Method: 提出了Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)，一种生成轨迹方法，支持3D体积、多时间点扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上，TFM超越了自然影像中的时空方法，成为4D医学图像预测的新基准。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学影像时间动态预测的空白，提供了强大的新方法。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Motivation: Leibovich评分在ccRCC复发风险分层中应用广泛，但缺乏患者级分辨率和影像信息。研究旨在探索多模态整合对个性化风险预测的可行性。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合设置。

Result: WSI模型表现优于CT模型，中间融合（如TITAN-CONCH与ResNet-18）接近调整后的Leibovich评分。随机平局缩小了临床基线模型与学习模型的差距。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于基础模型的多模态整合可行，未来需探索更具表现力的融合策略、更大数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Conclusion: DUN通过结合物理模型和深度学习，显著提升了CGH的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 交互式分割模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中具有高效、用户引导的工作流程潜力。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with

*Fatih Erdoğan,Merve Rabia Barın,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率投影机制，用于从相机图像中提取高精度的道路元素信息，以构建高清晰度地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将图像空间映射到鸟瞰图空间时存在准确性问题，容易产生幻觉元素。

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，结合置信度评分来优化映射并过滤无关元素，同时改进时间处理。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在长感知范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法通过概率投影和置信度评分显著提高了高清晰度地图的生成质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统OCR技术在字符分割和上下文利用上存在瓶颈，而现代技术转向单词级OCR后，单词分割成为新的瓶颈。

Method: 提出行级OCR方法，绕过单词检测错误，利用更大的句子上下文。

Result: 实验显示行级OCR提高了5.4%的端到端准确率和4倍的效率。

Conclusion: 行级OCR具有潜力，尤其是在文档图像处理中，并能利用大型语言模型的进步。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA是一种轻量级合成数据生成方法，通过LoRA微调显著降低计算需求，仅需消费级GPU即可生成高质量数据，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在数据增强中资源消耗大的问题，提出更高效、实用的合成数据生成方案。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过LoRA微调，减少计算需求，生成合成数据。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像即可超越基线方法5000张图像的性能，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA以更少数据和计算成本实现更优性能，推动合成数据生成在实际场景中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过监测CNN激活熵变化，无需修改模型即可高精度检测对抗性输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性输入检测方法需要重新训练或修改网络结构，影响性能。本文发现对抗性输入会在CNN激活中产生可检测的熵特征。

Method: 在VGG-16上并行监测激活熵，分析对抗性输入导致的熵变化。

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵偏移7%，检测准确率达90%，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN激活熵可独立用于评估模型可靠性，实现实时对抗性输入检测且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在真实场景中处理DMDs时表现不佳，尤其是在复杂条件下（如遮挡、运动模糊等）。

Method: 利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术生成多样化的合成数据集，并开发了DMDBench验证集。

Result: 通过合成数据集微调LVLMs，显著提升了模型性能（如InternVL得分提升200%）。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET工具能有效增强LVLMs在复杂条件下的鲁棒性，未来将开源以支持社区扩展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Motivation: 当前方法在低音频-视觉语义对应（如静音、噪声和屏幕外声音）情况下表现不佳，且评估仅限于单一可见声源的场景。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练策略（SSL-SaN），结合静音和噪声训练，并引入新的指标和扩展数据集IS3+。

Result: SSL-SaN在自监督模型中表现最佳，同时在声源定位和跨模态检索中取得先进成果。

Conclusion: 论文通过新策略、指标和数据集，显著提升了视觉声源定位任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI代理是实现人工通用智能的重要任务，但现有技术因数据稀缺、基础设施不足和基础模型能力有限而面临挑战。

Method: UItron采用监督微调感知和规划任务，并结合课程强化学习框架，同时建立了移动和PC设备的交互环境。

Result: UItron在GUI感知、定位和规划基准测试中表现优异，尤其在中文应用场景中取得显著进展。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施，推动了GUI代理在现实应用中的发展。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

TL;DR: 论文提出CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强领域感知和分离分类任务来提升CLIP在域泛化（DG）中的表现，特别是在更具挑战性的OOD数据集上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估对基础模型（如CLIP）可能不够挑战性，无法真正测试未见数据场景。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强领域感知和分离分类任务来优化CLIP的表现。

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的OOD数据集上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注封闭集中的典型数据，而开放世界中的非典型视频数据对学习的影响尚未充分探索。

Result: 非典型数据能提升模型性能，且类别多样性和语义多样性是关键因素。

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据对开放世界学习有益，鼓励未来研究关注这一方向。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据在无监督持续学习中的研究不足，现有方法依赖标签和任务边界，而实际应用中获取标签成本高且不切实际。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为无监督视频持续学习提供了有效的解决方案，适用于实际场景中的复杂视频数据处理。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学影像任务中开发高性能模型的稳健方法。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Motivation: 评估GPT-5在放射肿瘤学中的性能，以验证其作为临床决策支持工具的潜力。

Method: 通过两个基准测试评估GPT-5：ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实病例的治疗计划生成。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择测试中准确率达92.8%，治疗建议正确性和全面性评分高，但存在少量错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学中表现突出，但需进一步改进和专家监督以确保临床安全。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Motivation: 视频中对象的细粒度定位和语义理解是视频理解的基础任务，但数据标注成本高。

Method: 通过预处理带有真实掩码的视频，利用视觉语言模型生成伪对象描述，构建SAV-Caption数据集，并在混合数据集上训练VoCap模型。

Conclusion: VoCap模型和SAV-Caption数据集为视频对象理解提供了高效解决方案，并公开了数据集。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，忽略了视觉事件识别中固有的语义模糊性，导致性能受限。

Conclusion: 研究表明动词分类本质上是多标签问题，SPMLL和GE-VerbMLP为视觉事件识别提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的能力，填补现有基准测试在交通规则和边缘案例覆盖上的不足。

Method: 提出DriveQA基准测试，通过文本和视觉任务全面评估模型对交通规则的理解，并进行微调和预训练实验。

Result: LLM和MLLM在基础规则上表现良好，但在复杂场景中存在弱点；微调和预训练显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估和提升模型在驾驶知识测试中的能力提供了有效工具，并展示了预训练对下游任务的积极影响。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为视觉引导运动提供了简单、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农村宜居性测量方法难以规模化且不适用于农村环境，需要一种更高效、更合理的评估方法。

Method: 使用无人机影像和多模态大语言模型，结合专家知识构建思维链提示，评估农村宜居性。

Result: 中国农村宜居性呈现双核-外围空间模式，政府财政支出是核心影响因素。

Conclusion: 研究结果为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但对其在简单感知任务中的表现研究有限，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 通过生成7200张程序化图像，分为30个类别，测试MLLMs和LRMs在基础视觉感知任务中的表现。

Result: 实验显示，随着任务复杂度增加，MLLMs性能显著下降，且不同模型在特定认知技能上表现相似。

Conclusion: MLLMs在简单感知任务中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以提升其基础视觉能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Motivation: 医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在疾病诊断和临床决策中潜力巨大，但缺乏专门评估其奖励模型和评判者的基准，现有基准未能涵盖诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度。

Method: 提出Med-RewardBench基准，通过三步流程生成高质量评估数据，涵盖六个临床关键维度，并评估32个先进MLLMs。

Result: 评估显示现有模型与专家判断存在显著差距，但通过微调的基线模型表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the

motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Motivation: 现有方法（如SuGaR）在渲染方面有效，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性上仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入两种正则化策略：1）有效秩正则化，避免高斯原语的极端各向异性；2）神经SDF正则化，提供全局表面先验。

Result: 模型能够从3DGS数据生成更准确和一致的视觉效果。

Conclusion: 两种正则化策略显著提升了3DGS重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务，不涉及用户的关键选择或提供上下文信息，降低了用户自主性。

Method: Morae利用大型多模态模型解释用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要决策时提示用户澄清。

Result: 与基线代理相比，Morae帮助用户完成更多任务并选择更符合偏好的选项。

Conclusion: Morae展示了混合主动方法，用户既能享受自动化，又能表达偏好。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保深度模型在现实应用中的可靠性，需要区分训练分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）的样本。

Method: 利用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性成分和非显著成分，分别用于不同分布偏移场景的OOD检测。

Result: 在多种标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过结合决定性成分和非显著成分的优势，有效提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Motivation: 心率预测在现实世界中面临数据异质性（设备源和用户差异）的挑战，现有方法无法同时解决这两类问题。

Method: 采用随机特征丢弃策略处理设备源异质性，时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标处理用户异质性。

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比基线模型提升17%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了数据异质性，并在实际应用中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.
