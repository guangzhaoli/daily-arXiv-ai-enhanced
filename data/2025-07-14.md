Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对农业图像处理的领域感知框架，通过结合基于提示的专家评估和自一致性机制，提升了视觉语言模型在精准农业中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，影响了精准农业中作物病害识别的准确性。

Method: 采用基于提示的专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，结合领域适应的嵌入方法。

Result: 在玉米叶病害识别任务中，诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析和治疗建议也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，支持实时农业决策。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了这些模型在生成简单二进制图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对较少，其可靠性和性能评估不足，因此需要建立一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用gpt-4o生成文本描述作为基准，再通过文本到图像模型生成图像，最后用gpt-4o比较生成图像与基准描述的差异。

Result: 研究发现，模型在生成仅包含简单几何形状和位置的二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面仍有显著局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的LoRA权重初始化方法CNTLoRA，通过预训练和微调激活的约束关系，无需训练即可初始化权重，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。通过数据驱动的初始化方法，利用预训练和微调激活的关系，提升收敛和最终性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，通过预训练权重和微调激活向量的约束关系，推导出闭式解初始化权重，支持可变秩。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA通过数据驱动的权重初始化，显著提升了LoRA微调的性能和收敛速度，为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑理论的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要更高效的方法用于无人机图像分类。

Method: HML-ELM采用分层学习框架，包括无监督多层特征提取（ELM-AE）和监督分类（SIT2-FELM）。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在基准和实际无人机任务中均优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，特别适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Conclusion: 轻量级AI模型适合实时高光谱影像处理，支持星载AI系统开发。

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在非高斯噪声下，原本基于高斯噪声设计的去噪算法的表现。

Method: 使用均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声替代高斯噪声，测试算法性能。

Result: 实验在小规模计算环境下进行，结果展示了算法在非高斯噪声下的表现。

Conclusion: 算法在非高斯噪声下的性能表现值得进一步研究，尤其是在不同计算环境下的验证。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的单幅VHR SAR图像建筑物高度自动估计方法，表现优异，尤其在欧洲城市。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度建筑物高度估计对城市应用至关重要，现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测和目标回归的深度学习模型，使用多大陆数据集训练和评估。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现最佳（MAE约2.20米），跨大陆泛化能力虽有波动但仍具潜力。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单幅VHR SAR数据中展现出强大的跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS是一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块实现高保真度的场景对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且难以整合更多输入视图。

Method: 提出RegGS框架，利用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法求解最优传输距离，并结合光度一致性和深度几何进行联合配准。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上验证了RegGS的高保真配准能力，实现了精确的相机姿态估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS有效解决了稀疏视图下的3D高斯配准问题，提升了场景重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，但在遮挡情况下性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强重建的连贯性。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，显示处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无需预定义模型，显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing方法，通过自适应高斯差分隐私机制提升视觉模型对抗样本的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在对抗样本认证中缺乏输入自适应性，需改进。

Method: 利用引导去噪扩散模型作为自适应GDP机制序列，通过隐私过滤器分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet上，特定引导策略下提升了认证准确率和标准准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型对抗样本的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级实时深度估计和物体检测系统，帮助视障人士在城市中安全通行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国城市中视障人士因道路障碍物频繁受伤，亟需一种预警系统。

Result: 实现了轻量级实时模型，mAP50为0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士避免碰撞，提升出行安全。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS架构，用于医学图像分割，具有分辨率鲁棒性、高效性和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算和内存限制导致的输入尺寸缩减问题，以及离散训练带来的次优结果。

Method: 通过傅里叶神经算子建模图像分割，用Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，在频域中重新表述问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出优越的分辨率鲁棒性、最快的推理时间和最高的内存效率。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、参数少且分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfDist是一种用于三维体积实例分割的卷积神经网络架构，通过平滑参数化表面补丁表示实例，解决了StarDist-3D的局限性，并在某些数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的StarDist-3D模型在实例参数化维度与体素分辨率之间存在耦合，限制了预测的分辨率灵活性，且可能引入体素化伪影。SurfDist旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SurfDist基于StarDist-3D架构进行改进，解耦了实例参数化维度与体素分辨率，使用双三次贝塞尔三角形表示实例表面，支持任意高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学成像中常见的斑点状实例数据集上，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，且参数化更紧凑。实验通过合成和真实数据集验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习，为高分辨率实例分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学数据的应用，阻碍了更敏感的结局测量或早期损伤识别。

Method: PBL包括一个安全的云端智能手机应用和一个新颖的算法，用于将生物力学模型拟合到数据中，并在神经外科和运动医学诊所测试了其可用性和实用性。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了可扩展、低负担的生物力学测量工具，支持智能手机视频作为捕捉临床有意义数据的有效方法。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: CR-Net 是一种新型 SAR 目标检测方法，通过结构先验和证据学习理论提升跨分辨率检测的域适应能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR 分辨率提高导致散射特性差异增大，传统目标检测模型泛化能力受限，域适应技术因分辨率差异导致特征适应不可靠。

Method: CR-Net 结合了结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA），实现结构感知的特征适应和语义对齐。

Result: 在不同分辨率数据集上，CR-Net 通过保留域内结构和提升判别性，显著提升了跨分辨率适应性能，达到 SOTA 水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net 通过结构先验和可靠语义对齐，有效解决了跨分辨率 SAR 目标检测的挑战，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法在运动建模和内容合成中存在渲染伪影（如运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透），限制了稳定、细粒度运动场的表示。

Method: 提出三步统一框架：视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建。采用多粒度运动解耦策略独立建模非刚性和刚性运动，并设计运动一致性约束和交替优化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，生成质量PSNR提升2.43 dB，用户评价视频真实感提升0.64，推理速度达150 FPS。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过系统化框架和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的渲染质量和效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Result: 在自建的40名志愿者数据集上实验，验证了Siamese网络在颅骨识别中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在给定颅骨图像识别身份方面取得了满意结果。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得了显著进展，但由于现代模型规模大且缺乏透明度，其临床应用受到限制。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层中最相关的部分，实现有针对性的压缩，同时保持临床有意义的表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗环境中轻量级、可解释模型的现实部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 传统生成CBM依赖辅助视觉线索补偿概念未捕获的信息，损害了可解释性和组合性。

Method: 提出CoCo-Bot，基于扩散能量函数，支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定）。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ上实验显示，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过显式概念传递信息，解决了传统CBM的局限性，具有更好的组合性和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG在实验中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升了隐写术的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升了基于上下文学习(ICL)的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于标注医学图像的稀缺性，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且微调基础ICL模型成本高且可能导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，模型首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询图像和上下文对角色以验证预测，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上评估，CCV优于现有方法，证明了其在提升ICL分割性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的解决方案，能够增强基于ICL的医学图像分割，适用于通用医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解释中的潜力，尤其是针对老年驾驶员评估的关键任务。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型性能，并与人类标注结果对比。

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下性能提升明显；模型在停止标志检测中表现出高精确度但召回率较低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的支持工具，未来需进一步探索扩展性和模型架构优化。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Result: 在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU框架有效提升了低光视觉任务的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在艺术品标注上存在中心偏差且细粒度类别有限，无法满足人文领域计算机视觉的需求。

Method: 通过构建ODOR数据集，包含4712张图像的38,116个标注，并进行统计分析和基线模型测试。

Result: 数据集展示了细粒度类别、密集重叠对象和全画布空间分布等挑战性特性。

Conclusion: ODOR数据集推动了艺术品对象检测和视觉文化遗产研究的交叉探索。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi框架通过两阶段策略（身份传输和身份细化）实现主题一致且姿态多样的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性的同时牺牲了姿态和布局多样性，限制了视觉叙事的表达力。

Method: 采用身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR）两阶段策略，分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿态多样性和提示保真度方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需任务特定的架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定的架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成，提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取器和跨领域数据集（180万样本）预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在任务特定基准测试中与SOTA算法相当，并在异常场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch通过统一框架和强大特征提取器，实现了多任务的高效集成和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

TL;DR: SHC提出了一种基于语义哈希中心的三阶段框架，显著提升了大规模图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成哈希中心时忽略了类间语义关系，可能影响检索性能。

Method: 通过分类网络识别语义相似性，优化算法生成语义哈希中心，并训练深度哈希网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种新的条件提示学习方法，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，并结合视觉条件提示和上下文提示，显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示学习方法在未见类别的泛化能力不足以及跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），通过注意力互导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），并通过多提示融合机制（MPF）整合不同提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和多模态交互，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人难以实现类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 提出空间对比学习追踪实例的光栅化，增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和对象补全实验中，方法表现出更高的分解精度和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene在分解和补全任务中表现优异，为机器人3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU是一种训练自由的框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大，阻碍实际应用。现有方法主要利用时间维度加速，而RALU则从空间维度入手。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并结合噪声时间步重调度以稳定生成。

Result: RALU在FLUX上实现7倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现3倍加速，且图像质量下降最小。

Conclusion: RALU与现有时间加速方法互补，可进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参考视图引导，有效解决了多视图修复不一致的问题。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了预训练模型在图像分词任务中的潜力，为社区提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习为3D重建带来了革命性变化，未来需进一步解决模型精度和动态场景处理等问题，以推动更广泛的应用。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Result: 在单音乐谱、形状图和简化工程图等复杂记录结构上验证了方法的有效性，首次实现了工程图的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

Conclusion: D2Dewarp通过双维度特征融合和自动标注数据集，显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果。

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供全局解剖上下文。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval支持灵活查询（如形状、位置或部分特征），仅需最小用户提示，适用于多种临床场景。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。本文提出用强化学习优化其内存更新，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过手工规则更新内存，难以应对干扰、遮挡和运动。本文探索强化学习作为替代方案。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化内存更新。

Result: 在过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像翻译方法DA-KPN，通过轻量级翻译函数和像素级输入变换参数，确保合成标签与翻译结果的语义匹配，优于现有GAN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据标注困难，语义分割依赖合成数据训练，但现有无配对图像翻译方法无法保证语义匹配，影响分割性能。

Method: DA-KPN通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译结果真实，实现语义匹配。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中，DA-KPN优于现有GAN方法，并在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过轻量级设计和语义匹配保证，为低数据场景下的语义分割提供了更可靠的图像翻译方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: DISC提出了一种双流范式，通过分离优化实例和场景类别，提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的粒度。

Method: 采用类查询替代体素查询，结合类别特定的几何和语义先验，设计专用解码模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准上达到SOTA，单帧输入甚至优于多帧方法。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景上下文，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain
tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesTTA提出了一种贝叶斯适应框架，用于解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的性能退化问题，通过动态对齐视觉表示和一致性预测，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，时间演化的分布偏移（如光照或季节变化）会导致视觉语言模型的零样本识别性能显著下降，现有方法对此处理不足。

Method: BayesTTA通过贝叶斯框架动态估计类条件高斯混合分布，自适应选择协方差结构，并使用GDA进行校准推理，监督归一化层的自适应性调整。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上的实验表明，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: BayesTTA为时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时间适应提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Result: 标准化标注对日期和出生地等可标准化字段更有效，而外交标注对姓名等不可标准化字段表现更好。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适的标注方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多帧BEV特征结合能提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动导致特征变化限制了性能增益。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV方法，采用循环结构结合BEV特征，并通过MBFNet动态对齐时序特征，使用Temporal Consistency Learning Loss显式对齐特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV在仅使用摄像头的3D物体检测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 传统手动构建图像数据集的方法耗时且低效，而AI生成的数据不如真实数据有价值。

Method: 通过协调四个配备多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的智能体及图像优化工具包，按用户需求构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功训练了多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效构建高质量图像数据集，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的高效模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且存在挑战（如伪影）。通过合成7T图像，可以使其更广泛地应用于临床。

Method: 使用35例1.5T和108例3T T1加权MRI与对应的7T T1图进行验证，模型在训练、验证和测试集上表现优异，并与ResViT和ResShift模型对比。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM指标优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效合成7T质量的T1图，优于现有技术，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Motivation: 提升MLLMs的空间推理和基础能力，避免模型参数修改。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中表现一致提升，验证了零训练设置下深度提示的有效性。

Conclusion: ByDeWay是一种轻量级、模块化且兼容黑盒MLLMs的方法，能显著减少幻觉并增强空间推理。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中，多模态卫星图像（如光学和SAR）提供了同一地理区域的对齐视图，但存在类间相似性高、场景杂乱和边界模糊等挑战，现有对比学习框架难以应对。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合模态内和模态间的对比学习，并使用多标签监督对比损失，以优化多模态卫星图像的表示学习。

Conclusion: MoSAiC通过联合优化多模态对比学习，显著提升了多标签卫星图像任务的性能，尤其在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为肌肉分割提供了可扩展、可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for

matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力MIL框架，通过量化实例级注意力分数的不确定性，提高了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性注意力MIL方法忽略了实例相关性的不确定性，尤其在数字病理学中，这种不确定性对预测的可靠性至关重要。

Method: SGPMIL利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，引入特征缩放以加速训练并提升性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，同时提供了更可靠的实例级预测。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著提升了不确定性下的实例级预测质量，为数字病理学提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为智能城市应用提供了更真实的数据支持，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，用于解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉问题中常遇到训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来弥补数据不足。

Method: 使用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，STV特征能够表征多尺度纹理。

Result: 在医学影像数据上，STV学习器（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习方法（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics特征（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足的情况下表现优异，尤其在医学影像中细尺度STV特征对PET高摄取预测有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分层分类和跨域迁移中存在局限性，无法生成端到端的多粒度分层预测，且对异构层次结构的迁移关注不足。

Method: 提出了HieraRS范式，包括BHCCM机制和TransLU框架，支持动态类别扩展和语义对齐。

Result: 构建了MM-5B数据集，并展示了HieraRS在分层分类和跨域任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: HieraRS提升了模型的灵活性和泛化能力，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，限制了可扩展性和适应性，且大规模数字孪生面临隐私、通信和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane、个性化参数学习的Meta-GeoLane和联邦学习策略FedMeta-GeoLane。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种新型的无数据压缩算法，用于压缩Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有高效、快速和保持性能的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的出色表现，广泛应用于医疗和智能制造等领域，因此需要有效的压缩方法。

Method: Birkhoff采用Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转换为低维标量，并设计了HyperLinear层来加速推理。

Result: 在COCO、LVIS和SA-1B数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现了5.17倍的压缩比，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、快速且性能保持的SAM压缩方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST测试图像上达到99.2%的高准确率。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，该方法在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的细节、部分独立性和可控性，为3D设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFTs是一种高效且灵活的神经渲染方法，适用于动态场景表示和高效渲染。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过最小化架构修改和高效训练技术，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Motivation: 现有方法在重建精度、计算成本和验证方面存在困难，主要由于难以获取手工标记数据。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架，从基于最小抖动原理生成的合成数据中学习，并通过适应未标记的人类运动数据迭代优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

*Wenbo Cui,Chengyang Zhao,Yuhui Chen,Haoran Li,Zhizheng Zhang,Dongbin Zhao,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CL3R是一个新型3D预训练框架，通过结合空间感知和语义理解，提升机器人操作策略的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D基础模型，但缺乏3D空间信息和对多视角的泛化能力，限制了策略在精细操作中的表现。

Method: 采用点云掩码自编码器学习3D表示，并通过对比学习结合2D模型的语义知识；统一坐标系并融合多视角点云以提升泛化。

Result: 实验证明CL3R在仿真和现实中均优于现有方法，尤其在处理新视角时表现稳健。

Conclusion: CL3R通过3D预训练显著提升了机器人操作策略的感知能力，解决了2D模型的局限性。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

*Yuekun Wu,Yik Lung Pang,Andrea Cavallaro,Changjae Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建的方法（H2RH-SGS），用于从RGB图像学习机器人交接策略，无需真实机器人训练或数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实图像数据学习机器人操作策略时的高成本问题，以及仿真与真实环境间的视觉域差距。

Method: 利用稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建人类-机器人交接场景，生成机器人演示数据，并通过模拟相机姿态变化训练策略。

Result: 在16种家庭物品上训练的策略可直接部署到真实环境，实验证明H2RH-SGS是一种有效的表示方法。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

### [76] [PUMA: Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08064)
*Yibo Lyu,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Yijie Zhu,Weili Guan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: PUMA提出了一种层剪枝和模态自适应学习的高效统一多模态检索方法，显著降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在统一多模态检索（UMR）中表现优异，但参数量大导致训练成本高、推理效率低。

Method: 1. 结构上采用层剪枝自蒸馏，保留浅层并蒸馏深层特征；2. 学习上引入模态自适应对比学习损失（MAC-Loss），根据目标模态分组负样本并应用不同温度策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少资源使用，同时保持强大性能。

Conclusion: PUMA通过结构剪枝和学习优化，实现了高效且高性能的统一多模态检索。

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

### [77] [VideoConviction: A Multimodal Benchmark for Human Conviction and Stock Market Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08104)
*Michael Galarnyk,Veer Kejriwal,Agam Shah,Yash Bhardwaj,Nicholas Meyer,Anand Krishnan,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: VideoConviction是一个多模态数据集，用于评估金融领域中多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和文本大语言模型（LLMs）的表现，发现它们在区分投资行为和信念强度方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究金融影响者（finfluencers）在社交媒体上的多模态信号（如语气、表达方式）对投资决策的影响，填补了传统文本分析的不足。

Method: 通过457小时的人工标注，构建了包含6000+专家标注的VideoConviction数据集，用于评估MLLMs和LLMs在金融话语中的表现。

Result: 多模态输入提高了股票代码提取的准确性，但模型难以区分投资行为和信念强度；高信念推荐表现优于低信念推荐，但仍不及标普500指数基金。

Conclusion: 反向策略（对抗金融影响者推荐）年回报率高出标普500指数6.8%，但风险更高；数据集为多模态金融研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our
code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0

### [78] [Visual Semantic Description Generation with MLLMs for Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08590)
*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成视觉语义描述（VSD）的新框架，通过实例级和原型级对齐提升图像文本匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉和文本模态在表示上的差异问题，通过语义锚点实现跨模态对齐。

Method: 结合实例级（视觉特征与VSD融合）和原型级（VSD聚类）对齐模块，可无缝集成到现有模型中。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MSCOCO上表现显著提升，并展示出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了图像文本匹配性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

TL;DR: LoGIC是一种多智能体强化学习方法，通过‘说话者’和‘倾听者’的协作游戏提升无监督图像描述性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注数据集已被大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）使用，改进性能困难，因此探索无监督图像描述性能。

Method: 提出LoGIC，使用GRPO算法训练‘说话者’和‘倾听者’协作游戏，结合预训练VLMs和LLM。

Result: 无监督微调后BLEU得分46，优于基线VLM的44；轻量组件组合在无监督设置下BLEU得分31，优于现有方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC通过多智能体协作游戏有效提升无监督图像描述性能，为资源有限场景提供轻量解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

*Deepali Mishra,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,Ashutosh Modi,Madhumita Sushil,Sorayouth Chumnanvej*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的不足以及与临床需求的脱节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用价值，识别其挑战和差距，以促进其更好地融入临床实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA具有潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

*Yupu Liang,Yaping Zhang,Zhiyang Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Yang Zhao,Lu Xiang,Chengqing Zong,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为同步自审（SSR）的新微调范式，以解决多模态大语言模型在文档图像机器翻译（DIMT）任务中遗忘OCR能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在DIMT任务中面临跨模态和跨语言挑战，且传统微调方法会导致OCR能力遗忘。

Method: 通过同步自审（SSR）范式，模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明，SSR学习有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，提升了模型在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能够同时保持和提升模型的多任务能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上的不足，提升实际应用能力。

Method: 结合高质量数据生成（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略（任务特定奖励）。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，通用和空间推理表现优异。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过创新数据与训练方法，显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考样本的定位问题，现有自动化方法未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用网格化方法，在多模态大模型（LMM）的零样本设置下，结合文本描述与地图视觉信息进行地理定位。

Result: 实验显示，该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有地理参考工具。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型能有效理解精细地图，提出的框架可集成到地理参考工作流中。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FlowDrag利用几何信息改进拖拽编辑，通过3D网格变形和UNet去噪实现更精确的编辑，并提出了带真实标注的VFD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前拖拽编辑方法因仅关注用户定义的点而忽略整体几何，导致不一致性和伪影。

Method: FlowDrag构建3D网格，通过能量函数指导变形，并将位移投影到2D结合UNet去噪。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD Bench和DragBench上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何信息提升了编辑的准确性和一致性，VFD数据集为评估提供了真实标注。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在捕捉相机-物体关系（如物体方向、相机视角和镜头）方面表现不佳，主要因训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 使用3D资产输入，结合渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，并利用大语言模型生成文本提示，创建Ultimate3D数据集（240K VQAs）。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务中，微调后的MLLMs平均准确率提升33.4%，显著优于商业模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集、代码和基准将推动MLLMs的广泛应用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

Conclusion: 多光谱LiDAR技术在自动化森林成分分割中具有巨大潜力，能显著提高分割精度。

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实例拼图恢复的新型MIL方法，用于WSI分析，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法依赖置换不变性，限制了其捕捉WSI中实例间语义关联的能力。

Method: 通过学习恢复随机打乱的实例顺序（实例拼图问题），并设计了一种Siamese网络解决方案。

Result: 在WSI分类和生存预测任务中表现优于现有MIL方法。

Conclusion: 非置换不变性方法能更有效地捕捉实例间空间关联，提升WSI分析性能。

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICAC总体积指标忽略了钙化位置对预后的关键影响，而传统3D模型因技术限制无法实现段特异性量化。

Method: 将3D问题转化为1D轴向的并行概率地标定位任务，通过处理2D切片序列预测6个独立概率分布以定位关键解剖标志。

Result: 在100名患者的临床队列中，5折交叉验证显示平均绝对误差为0.1切片，96%预测误差在±1切片内，并在公开基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: DST是首个实现自动化段特异性ICAC分析的工具，为研究位置特异性生物标志物在诊断和预后中的作用奠定了基础。

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.
