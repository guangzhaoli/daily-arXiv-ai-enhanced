Result: The workshop aims to inspire advancements in novelty handling and safe autonomous driving practices.

Conclusion: 2COOOL provides a dedicated forum to push the state of the art in autonomous driving safety, building on previous success.

Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

### [2] [Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088)
*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了深度学习在全景X射线图像中自动分类牙齿状况的方法，比较了三种方法，发现混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过深度学习技术提高牙齿状况自动分类的准确性和效率，以支持牙科诊断。

Method: 使用了1,512张X射线图像数据集，评估了自定义CNN、混合模型（CNN+传统分类器）和预训练模型（如VGG16）。

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型以85.4%的准确率表现最佳，优于自定义CNN（74.3%）和预训练模型（VGG16为82.3%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型在牙齿状况分类中表现优异，但需更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Q-Align方法，通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，提升语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中面临注意力泄漏问题，影响语义映射的准确性。

Method: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和注意力细化三个核心贡献，改善语义对齐和特征对应。

Result: 实验表明Q-Align在外观保真度上优于现有方法，同时保持结构保留的竞争力。

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更优的语义对齐方案。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache 是一个用于加速扩散模型推理的缓存框架，通过减少特征重用带来的误差，实现了2倍加速且保持或提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，特征缓存虽能加速，但直接重用会导致质量下降。

Method: 提出 ERTACache，通过离线残差分析、动态调整积分区间和线性化误差模型，联合纠正缓存误差。

Result: 在图像和视频生成任务中，ERTACache 实现了2倍加速，视觉质量保持或提升。

Conclusion: ERTACache 显著提升了扩散模型的推理效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的任务Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来优化视频问答和指令调优数据，显著提升了视频语言理解的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在捕捉细粒度时间语义方面表现不佳，主要由于稀疏帧采样和帧间推理监督不足。

Method: 提出TVS任务，包括保留关键视频片段、同步重构查询以保持答案一致性，并作为模块化前端适配器集成到训练和推理流程中。

Result: TVS在训练和推理阶段分别带来7.33%和34.6%的相对增益，ReSimplifyIt基线模型在视频修剪任务中F-1得分提升0.47。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化时间信息筛选，显著提升了视频语言理解的性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于骨骼姿态标注的手术工具定位方法，并发布了ROBUST-MIPS数据集，以促进该标注方式的采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的分割方法受限于标注数据的多样性，骨骼姿态标注在语义信息丰富性和标注效率之间取得了平衡。

Method: 通过ROBUST-MIPS数据集结合工具姿态和实例分割标注，并建立简单基准测试验证姿态标注的有效性。

Result: 实验表明姿态标注在手术工具定位任务中表现优异，同时发布了标注软件和基准模型。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是一种高效的手术工具定位方法，ROBUST-MIPS数据集和工具将推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种创新的即插即用安全补丁，用于减少T2I模型中的不安全内容生成，显著优于现有安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I生成模型取得了进展，但其潜在的滥用风险引发了严重的安全问题，现有安全机制存在局限性。

Method: 通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，Safe-Control向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持灵活合并多种安全补丁。

Result: 在六种T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种高效、灵活且兼容性强的安全解决方案，适用于多种T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一种新方法，用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域的位置，特别针对模糊边界的stuff-type目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域、无目标或多目标时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出GENNAV，预测目标存在性并生成多目标区域的掩码，构建GRiN-Drive基准进行评估。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法，并在真实世界实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: GENNAV在多样化的真实环境中展现了鲁棒性和零样本迁移性能。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，通过双模式退火和策略优化，根据问题复杂度决定是否激活思考过程，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在简单问题上冗余思考，效率低下，R-4B旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双模式退火和Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO)，分两阶段训练模型。

Result: 在25个基准测试中表现优异，优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，接近更大模型性能。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个融合RGB、热成像和深度数据的框架，通过Mamba-based融合机制提升对隐藏或伪装目标的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等复杂条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法。

Method: 提出HiddenObject框架，利用Mamba-based融合机制整合多模态数据，提取互补特征并生成统一表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，性能达到或超越现有方法，揭示了当前单模态和简单融合策略的局限性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based融合架构能显著推动多模态目标检测领域的发展，尤其在视觉退化或复杂条件下。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一种新型框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，解决了CT/X射线配准中的高精度和实时性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在空间信息丢失和领域差距问题，而现有双平面X射线重建方法受限于密集视图需求和噪声干扰。

Method: RadGS-Reg结合了基于学习的辐射高斯重建和反事实注意力学习机制，并通过患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应真实数据。

Result: 实验表明，RadGS-Reg在内部数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg为CT/X射线配准提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在噪声X射线和稀疏视图条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个包含620万合成3D住宅建筑的多模态数据集，支持LoD 4级别的语义注释，用于自动化生成3D建筑模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模公开标注数据集，自动生成精确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过合成数据生成多模态数据集，包括3D线框、平面图和LiDAR点云。

Result: 数据集支持开发生成式AI算法，实现基于预设布局和几何一致性的3D模型自动化生成。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为3D建筑模型的自动化生成提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在几何计算机视觉中，单应性估计是关键步骤，但实际图像常受镜头畸变影响，尤其是径向畸变。现有方法分别处理三种畸变配置，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置（单图像畸变、相同畸变和独立畸变），并构建了快速、稳定且准确的最小求解器。

Result: 新求解器在所有三种情况下均比现有技术更快，同时保持相似准确性，并在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的基准测试中验证了性能。

Conclusion: 本文的统一方法为径向畸变与单应性估计提供了高效解决方案，新求解器在速度和准确性上表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GCAV的框架，通过统一不同层的CAV来解决概念不一致性问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAV在不同层计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠。

Method: 采用对比学习对齐概念表示，并通过注意力融合机制构建全局统一的CAV。

Result: 实验表明，GCAV显著减少了TCAV分数的方差，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息，提供了更全面和可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

Method: VICP利用LLM从少量正负对中推断语义规则，并通过动态视觉提示指导VFM提取特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在新类别上表现显著优于基线。

Conclusion: VICP通过语义与视觉对齐实现了对新类别的泛化，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于MRI的胰腺肿瘤自动分割，使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER Challenge的两个任务中评估，结果显示不同MRI序列对分割性能的影响较大，性能中等但展示了自动化分割的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但由于解剖结构多变和数据集有限，自动化分割仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型和Auto3DSeg架构，通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在两种MRI序列（T1加权和T2加权）的数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: Task 1的DSC为0.56，Task 2的DSC降至0.33，表明不同MRI序列对分割性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 尽管性能中等，研究展示了自动化分割的潜力，并强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集以提高模型的鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Reverse Imaging的物理驱动方法，通过反向推断心脏MRI图像的底层自旋属性，解决分割模型在不同成像序列中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列中泛化能力差，主要由于图像对比度的显著变化。这些变化源于成像协议的不同，但所有图像都受相同的基本自旋属性（如质子密度、T1和T2值）支配。

Method: 通过解决非线性逆问题，从观测到的心脏MRI图像中反向推断自旋属性，并利用扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中估计有意义且可解释的自旋属性，从而合成任意新序列的图像，显著提高了分割模型在不同对比度和成像协议中的准确性。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging方法通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应，实现了心脏MRI分割模型的广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过利用用户特定形状信息提高视频中的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法通常忽略用户特定身体形状和3D姿态的合理性，导致3D精度不足。

Method: PHD首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器作为姿态先验。

Result: 该方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据进行训练。

Conclusion: PHD是一种高效的数据驱动模块，可无缝集成现有3D姿态估计器以提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时间剪枝策略动态减少冗余计算，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出色，但其迭代性和多假设需求导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝策略（HTP），包括时间相关性增强剪枝（TCEP）、稀疏聚焦时间多头自注意力（SFT MHSA）和掩码引导姿态标记剪枝（MGPTP）。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP减少了训练和推理的计算量，提升了推理速度，同时达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HTP策略显著提升了扩散模型的效率，同时保持了高精度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume框架通过2D指纹图像生成逼真的合成3D OCT指纹数据，解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT数据获取成本高且耗时，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习模型的发展。

Method: Print2Volume框架包含三个阶段：2D风格转换、3D结构扩展网络和OCT真实性细化。

Result: 生成了42万样本的合成数据集，预训练模型在真实数据集上微调后，EER从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume有效解决了OCT数据稀缺问题，显著提升了指纹识别性能。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

TL;DR: GLENDA数据集是首个针对子宫内膜异位症的妇科腹腔镜图像数据集，旨在解决手术视频手动分析耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手动分析妇科腹腔镜手术视频耗时且低效，需要计算机视觉和机器学习方法改进，但缺乏相关样本数据。

Method: 与医学专家合作，创建了包含子宫内膜异位症区域标注的GLENDA数据集。

Result: 发布了首个针对子宫内膜异位症的妇科腹腔镜图像数据集，填补了该领域数据空白。

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集为开发更高效的计算机视觉和机器学习方法提供了基础，有助于改进手术视频分析。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息来源，但自动内容索引仍面临挑战，尤其是手术器械的分割和识别。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的手术器械分割和识别，包括二值分割和多类器械识别。

Result: 实验表明，即使训练样本较少，也能高精度分割器械区域，但器械类型识别仍因相似性高而困难。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割可行且准确，但器械识别仍需改进，尤其是在器械高度相似的情况下。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,

pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

Method: 开发了一个三层组织（来源、组织类型、病理变化）的详细组织地图框架。

Result: 通过具体案例展示了该方法在WSI目录、机器学习和图表示中的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的标准提高了WSI数据的互操作性和自动化处理能力。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，增量学习的数据通常未标注，而现有方法假设数据完全标注，不切实际。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将其集成到多种CIL方法中，并通过置信度选择优化性能。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上性能下降较小，优于现有class-iNCD方法5%以上。

Conclusion: ICPL在无标注增量学习中表现优异，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）计算需求高，难以在本地设备上部署，因此探索轻量级图像描述模型的潜力。

Method: 基于125M参数的语言模型实现轻量级描述模型，并提出Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架，通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表征。

Result: 模型性能接近大型多模态通用模型，但存在视觉盲区问题；改进框架显著提升了描述质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型可作为本地设备的视觉专家，改进的框架有效解决了视觉盲区问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 基础模型（FMs）在痴呆症诊断中具有潜力，但其在联邦学习（FL）系统中的整合尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用大脑MRI数据和多队列数据集，系统评估分类头架构、微调策略和聚合方法对联邦FM调整的性能和效率的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在分散临床环境中部署FMs提供了实用见解，并强调了未来方法开发中需要权衡的关键因素。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多方法集成（MME）评分，通过结合特征截断和多种评分函数，显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注单一技术或特定类型的OOD数据集，忽略了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断和多种评分函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MME显著优于现有方法，例如在ImageNet-1K上FPR95降低了6%。

Conclusion: MME通过结合多种技术，有效提升了OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Motivation: 现有基于DNN的船舶检测技术易受对抗补丁攻击，且传统数据增强方法可能因过度增强背景或非目标区域引入干扰，导致误检。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅增强目标区域，避免背景干扰，使损失函数更直接关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法有效减少了背景干扰，提升了对抗补丁攻击的效果。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLMs）在长视频中易产生语义聚合幻觉（SAH），但此前研究集中于短视频，对SAH的成因和缓解缺乏系统研究。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准，分析SAH的成因；通过实验验证SAH与语义复杂性的关系；提出位置编码策略和DPO策略缓解SAH。

Result: 实验证实SAH存在且随语义复杂性增加；模型在快速变化的语义中更易产生SAH；提出的方法显著降低了SAH比例（27.7%）。

Conclusion: 论文填补了长视频SAH研究的空白，提出的方法有效缓解了SAH，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的升采样器网络，用于提升低分辨率基础模型特征的分辨率，以高效处理显微镜图像的分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的特征基础模型在处理显微镜图像时，难以捕捉细微特征且无法应对大尺寸图像。

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，利用输入图像对低分辨率基础模型特征进行升采样。

Result: 升采样后的特征能够有效分割多种显微镜图像，包括植物细胞、锂离子电池阴极和有机晶体，且交互式分割效果优于传统卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了分割质量，减少了标注需求，适用于复杂显微镜图像分析。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

TL;DR: HCCM框架通过区域-全局对比学习和匹配学习，解决了无人机场景中视觉-语言理解的挑战，提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中的宽视野和复杂语义对视觉-语言理解提出了挑战，现有方法缺乏细粒度语义和动态环境适应性。

Method: 提出HCCM框架，包含区域-全局图像-文本对比学习（RG-ITC）和匹配学习（RG-ITM），以及动量对比与蒸馏机制（MCD）。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上，HCCM在图像和文本检索中达到最佳性能；在ERA数据集上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: HCCM通过层次化跨粒度学习，显著提升了无人机场景中的视觉-语言理解能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的方法，从单张图像重建完整的3D场景，包括遮挡部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在重建遮挡和未观测区域时存在模糊、不真实和无法捕捉多模态解释的问题。

Method: 使用变分自重构器学习潜在空间，并在其上训练扩散模型，以生成多样化的3D高斯分布表示。

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建和多样化的样本，完成遮挡区域的高质量360度渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式建模解决了传统回归方法的局限性，实现了从单张图像重建完整3D场景的目标。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在主观或困难的标注任务中，成对比较比绝对评分或序数分类更可靠，但传统方法需要大量标注（O(n^2)）。

Method: EZ-Sort利用CLIP模型进行零样本预排序，初始化基于桶的Elo分数，并运行不确定性引导的MergeSort。

Result: 在多个数据集上，EZ-Sort将人工标注成本减少了90.5%（相比穷举法）和19.8%（相比先前工作），同时保持或提高了评分可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验和不确定性采样，EZ-Sort提供了一种高效且可扩展的成对排序解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，从第一人称视角建模人类-物体交互（HOI）是一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。

Method: ECHO采用Diffusion Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人类运动、物体轨迹和接触序列，支持灵活输入配置。

Result: ECHO在egocentric HOI重建中表现优于现有方法，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: ECHO为从最小观察中恢复HOI提供了灵活且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 研究提出了城市空间推理作为VLMs的新挑战，并展示了合成数据集在适应专业领域中的实用性。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像中多关注单时间点或特定任务，缺乏对时间动态的细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)，通过学习时间分布，支持3D体积、多时间点和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上，TFM超越现有方法，成为4D医学图像预测的新基准。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学图像时间动态建模的空白，为4D预测提供了鲁棒且先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Motivation: Leibovich评分在ccRCC的复发风险分层中广泛使用，但分辨率有限且未包含影像信息，因此需要更精确的预测方法。

Method: 研究采用模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中期融合设置。

Result: 病理图像模型优于CT模型，中期融合进一步提升了性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中可行，未来需探索更强大的融合策略和更大数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上实现了PSNR超过35 dB的先进结果。

Conclusion: DUN通过结合物理模型和深度学习，显著提升了CGH的重建精度和灵活性。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标准映射技术（如基于注意力的方法），存在泛化问题，容易产生虚假道路元素。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在长感知范围任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: 新方法通过几何映射和概率投影机制有效提升了HD地图生成的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Result: 实验显示端到端准确性提升5.4%，效率提高4倍。

Conclusion: 行级OCR在准确性和效率上均有显著提升，未来可结合大型语言模型进一步优化。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA是一种轻量级合成数据生成方法，通过LoRA微调显著降低计算需求，仅需消费级GPU即可生成高质量数据，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在数据增强中资源消耗大的问题，提出更高效、实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过LoRA微调，减少计算需求。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像即可超越基线方法5000张图像的性能（提升21.3% mAP）。

Conclusion: FLORA以更少数据和计算成本实现更优性能，推动合成数据生成的实用化。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过监测CNN激活熵来检测对抗性扰动的方法，无需修改模型即可实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性扰动检测方法需要重新训练模型、修改网络结构或影响干净输入的性能，而本文旨在找到一种无需修改模型即可检测对抗性扰动的方法。

Method: 通过监测CNN（如VGG-16）激活层的熵变化，发现对抗性输入会导致早期卷积层的激活熵显著偏移。

Result: 实验表明，对抗性输入会使早期卷积层的激活熵偏移7%，检测准确率达90%，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN的激活熵可以独立用于评估模型可靠性，为实时检测对抗性输入的自诊断视觉系统提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Motivation: 现有LVLMs在复杂现实场景（如遮挡、运动模糊）中读取DMD值表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 利用3D CAD模型和高级渲染技术生成合成数据集CAD2DMD-SET，并开发真实验证集DMDBench。

Result: 通过合成数据微调LVLMs，InternVL性能提升200%，且不影响其他任务表现。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET显著增强LVLMs在复杂条件下的鲁棒性，未来将开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Result: SSL-SaN在声源定位和跨模态检索任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过新策略、模型和数据集，显著提升了视觉声源定位任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI代理是实现自动化操作的重要任务，但现有模型在操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足和基础模型能力有限等方面存在挑战。

Method: UItron采用监督微调感知和规划任务，并开发课程强化学习框架，支持复杂推理和在线环境探索。

Result: UItron在GUI感知、定位和规划基准测试中表现优异，特别是在中文移动应用场景中取得显著进展。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施，推动GUI代理向实际应用迈进一步。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对CLIP等基础模型的域泛化评估可能不够挑战性，且未能充分测试真正未见数据场景。CLIP在更离群的数据集上性能显著下降。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法，通过分离分类特征和增强领域感知表示，利用合成数据和单独领域头来优化CLIP的域泛化能力。

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中表现优于现有方法，尤其在离群数据集上。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据对开放世界视觉表征学习有益，鼓励进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据在无监督持续学习中未被充分探索，现有研究依赖标签和任务边界，而实际应用中标签获取成本高且不切实际。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无标签和任务边界的情况下，有效提升了视频持续学习的性能。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: 该方法为有限数据和复杂医学影像任务提供了高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Motivation: 评估GPT-5在放射肿瘤学中的性能，以验证其作为临床决策支持工具的潜力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实病例的治疗计划生成，由四位专家评估。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择测试中准确率达92.8%，治疗建议正确性和全面性评分高，幻觉现象罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学中表现优异，但需进一步改进和专家监督以确保临床安全。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够根据多模态提示生成时空掩码和对象描述，同时解决视频对象分割、引用表达分割和对象描述任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中对象的细粒度定位和语义属性理解是视频理解的基础任务，但数据标注成本高。

Method: 通过预处理视频和真实掩码，利用视觉语言模型生成伪对象描述，构建SAV-Caption数据集，并在混合数据集上训练VoCap模型。

Result: VoCap在引用表达视频对象分割任务中达到最先进水平，在半监督视频对象分割中表现优异，并建立了视频对象描述基准。

Conclusion: VoCap和SAV-Caption数据集为视频理解任务提供了高效解决方案，并公开了数据集。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的单正多标签学习方法（SPMLL）来解决视觉事件识别中的动词分类问题，并设计了GE-VerbMLP模型，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，忽略了视觉事件识别中固有的语义模糊性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SPMLL框架，结合图神经网络和对抗训练，设计GE-VerbMLP模型以捕捉标签相关性并优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上，方法实现了超过3%的MAP提升，同时在传统指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，SPMLL和GE-VerbMLP为视觉事件识别提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的能力，填补现有基准测试在交通规则和边缘案例覆盖上的不足。

Method: 提出DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉数据，覆盖交通规则和复杂场景，并进行实验验证。

Result: LLM和MLLM在基础规则上表现良好，但在复杂场景中存在不足；微调和预训练显著提升性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估和提升LLM在驾驶知识中的能力提供了有效工具，并展示了预训练对下游任务的积极影响。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Motivation: 未注册的网格（如原始3D扫描）缺乏点对点对应关系且存在噪声，导致自动计算合理变形困难。

Method: 结合鲁棒的运动嵌入网络和学习的顶点特征场，生成时空变形场以驱动网格变形。

Result: 在行走和跑步等任务上的定量基准和定性视觉评估证明了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在挑战性未注册网格上表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

TL;DR: 提出两种正则化策略，提升3D高斯溅射(3DGS)重建的视觉保真度和场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SuGaR在渲染方面表现良好，但在视觉保真度和场景一致性上仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入两种正则化策略：1) 有效秩正则化，避免高斯形状极端各向异性；2) 结合神经SDF，优化全局表面一致性。

Result: 模型能生成更准确、一致的3DGS视觉效果。

Conclusion: 两种正则化策略显著提升了3DGS重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Motivation: 结合视觉与本体感知以提高四足机器人在复杂地形中的运动控制鲁棒性。

Result: 在多样地形中表现优异，返回更高、距离更远、碰撞更少。

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为视觉引导运动提供了简单、有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在现实应用中的可靠性，需要区分训练分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）的样本。

Method: 利用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性成分和非显著成分，分别用于处理Far-OOD和Near-OOD场景。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过结合决定性成分和非显著成分的优势，有效提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上分别比基线模型提升17%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了数据异构性问题，并在下游任务中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

Conclusion: 研究结果为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and

with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the

or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.
