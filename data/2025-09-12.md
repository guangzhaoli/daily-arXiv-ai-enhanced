### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2是一个统一的多模态检索模型，支持图像和文本组成的多模态查询，并在多模态文档集合中进行检索，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索方法主要依赖于特定任务的视觉语言模型微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法处理日益复杂的多模态检索任务。

Method: 利用多层表示和带有LSTM门控机制的循环Transformer架构，动态整合跨层和跨模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中始终达到最先进性能，推理速度更快且内存使用更少，在检索增强生成管道中提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2提供了一个高效统一的多模态检索解决方案，在保持高性能的同时提升了效率，并为多模态检索任务设立了新的基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用视觉扩散模型(VDM)特征和Transformer聚合来实现跨物种、视角和场景的人类级动作识别泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别不同物种、视角和场景下的相同动作，但当前的深度学习模型在此类泛化方面表现不佳

Method: 利用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过Transformer进行聚合，并使用基于扩散过程早期时间步的条件模型来增强语义信息

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角和跨场景的三个泛化基准测试中都达到了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术防止LLM生成有害信息，使用对比学习和多目标优化实现25-30%的危害减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动预防对弱势群体（LGBTQ+、单亲家庭、边缘化社区）的有害输出。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术，整合少样本学习、伦理链式推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化和形式化证明。

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性分析证明25-30%的危害减少，建立基于GitHub数据集的理论验证框架。

Conclusion: PromptGuard为系统性实证研究建立了数学基础，提供了实时危害预防的智能专家系统解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [4] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，使用Beta混合分布模型检测标签噪声，在噪声环境下提升Re-ID性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-ID方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似度任务，采用Siamese网络架构，结合Beta混合分布模型进行异常值检测，使用交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失联合优化

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有方法，展现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计异常检测有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的Re-ID任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

### [5] [SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934)
*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net端到端框架，通过多尺度结构先验、状态空间远程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICA图像对比度低、噪声高、血管结构复杂精细，现有分割和检测方法在临床应用中面临重大挑战，需要更精确的血管分割和狭窄检测方法

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架，编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块突出血管结构，解码器引入渐进高频感知模块通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构

Result: 在八个分割指标上持续优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中获得最高真阳性率和阳性预测值

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net通过多尺度结构先验和频域增强策略，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发全自动MRI影像分析框架，结合SAM分割模型和SurvAMINN生存分析网络，显著提升结直肠癌肝转移手术预后预测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌肝转移患者预后差异大，现有临床和基因组预测模型预测能力不足，特别是在多病灶病例中，需要更准确的手术预后预测方法

Method: 提出全自动框架：1）使用SAMONAI算法进行3D分割，从单点提示分割肝脏、肿瘤和脾脏；2）SurvAMINN自编码器多实例神经网络从生存数据中联合学习降维和风险预测，重点关注最具侵袭性的肿瘤

Result: 在227名患者数据集上评估，框架性能超越现有临床和基因组生物标志物，C-index提升超过10%

Conclusion: 整合自动分割算法和基于影像组学的生存分析，可为CRLM提供准确、注释高效且可解释的预后预测

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法用于比较不同文本到图像生成模型的视觉表示差异，发现特定提示下某个模型独有的视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型在相同文本提示下产生的视觉表示差异，了解模型间的概念表达分歧。

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现一个模型比另一个模型更常出现的视觉属性，并找出触发这些差异的提示概念。

Result: 构建了ID2数据集，包含60个输入依赖的差异，CompCon在发现分歧表示方面优于LLM和VLM基线方法。

Conclusion: CompCon能有效揭示不同文本到图像模型在视觉表示上的系统性差异，如PixArt对孤独提示的特定描绘方式和SD3.5对非裔美国人职业的特定表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种用于处理无人机系统图像中云影和光照折射的新驱动学习方法，通过U-Net深度学习模型识别和恢复受影响区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机系统在云层条件下能够获取图像，但图像受到云影和光照折射的严重影响，很难估算水质参数

Method: 使用U-Net深度学习模型，在像素级别进行数据提取和训练，识别和分离云影、光照折射区域与清晰区域

Result: 确定了最佳模型训练设置，得到了高质量的图像纠正模型，能够恢复图像中的云影和光照折射区域

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新驱学习方法有效解决了无人机图像中云影和光照折射的问题，为水质参数估算提供了更准确的图像数据

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin提出了一种新颖的特征融合架构，通过将局部卷积特征学习与分层移位窗口注意力相结合，解决了ViT在小数据集上局部特征提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在小数据集上往往过分关注全局上下文而忽略局部特征提取，缺乏关键归纳偏置如局部性和平移等变性。

Method: CoSwin在每个注意力块中集成了可学习的局部特征增强模块，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，CoSwin相比最先进的卷积和基于transformer的模型取得了持续的性能提升，特别是在CIFAR-100上提升4.92%，Tiny ImageNet上提升4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习，实现了双边源-目标匹配，在多个数据集上达到最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的可微框架，以提高匹配准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，通过3D空间中的最近邻搜索进行双边源-目标重新定位，然后通过全局几何一致性学习堆叠配对点特征来预测点级匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的匹配率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，显著提升了刚性配准性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher框架通过结合局部和全局几何一致性，在各种室内外场景和部分匹配任务中都表现出优异的鲁棒性和准确性，实现了最先进的点云配准性能。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

### [11] [UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991)
*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON：一种基于占据表示的超声图像3D重建方法，利用声学特征在弱监督优化中改善几何一致性，无需额外标注成本，解决了遮挡和视图依赖性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由手超声成像中，医生需要将2D视图整合为3D解剖结构。现有方法依赖精确标注且忽略B模式图像中的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声的视图依赖性和声影伪影问题。

Method: 提出基于占据表示的方法UltrON，利用B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化。设计新型损失函数补偿视图依赖性，支持多视角超声的占据优化，整合声学特性实现同类解剖结构的泛化。

Result: UltrON有效缓解了遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，实现了更准确的3D重建。该方法无需额外标注成本，能够从B模式图像中提取声学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为超声3D重建提供了更有效的解决方案，通过利用声学信息和改进的优化策略，显著提升了重建质量和实用性。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出基于隐式神经表示(INR)的方法，无需推理时优化即可预测连续左心室位移，在UK Biobank数据集上取得了最佳跟踪精度和应变误差，速度比最准确基线快380倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动量化心肌内运动和应变从标记MRI仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要开发准确且可扩展的分析方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)和径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet提出动态加权策略改进通用域适应，通过关注相关类别边界提升已知与未知类别的区分能力，在多个基准测试中显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用域适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精准的适应策略来提升已知和未知类别的区分效果。

Method: 提出增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，集成动态加权策略到开集熵最小化中，利用闭集分类器预测结果，针对每个目标样本关注最相关的类别边界。

Result: 在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在Open-Partial DA设置中31个任务中22个优于MLNet，在Open-Set DA设置中31个任务中19个表现更优。

Conclusion: E-MLNet的聚焦适应策略有效提升了通用域适应性能，证明了动态加权方法在区分已知和未知类别方面的优势。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了COCO-Urdu数据集，这是最大的公开乌尔都语图像字幕数据集，包含5.9万张图片和31.9万个字幕，通过混合多模态质量评估框架确保质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为拥有2.5亿使用者的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏支持，缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展

Method: 从MS COCO数据集通过分层抽样选择图像，使用SeamlessM4T v2翻译字幕，并采用混合多模态质量评估框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP相似度、BERTScore加回译）进行验证和迭代优化

Result: 构建了包含5.9万张图片和31.9万个乌尔都语字幕的大规模数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF指标上表现出色

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu填补了乌尔都语多模态研究的空白，通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fMRI视觉解码方法大多依赖特定主体训练，限制了可扩展性和实际部署，需要开发支持多主体训练的高效解码方法

Method: 结合Token Merging Transformer进行高效体素压缩和查询驱动的Q-Former生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小神经表示

Result: 在7T自然场景数据集上，VoxelFormer在训练包含的主体上实现竞争性检索性能，且参数量显著少于现有方法

Conclusion: token合并和基于查询的transformer是参数高效神经解码的有前景策略

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM是一种新的3D脑部MRI生成方法，通过概率图模型和空间掩码整合解剖学约束，能够生成高质量的脑部MRI图像，并成功复现疾病对大脑皮层的细微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实图像生成模型缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保留细粒度的解剖细节，难以生成解剖学上合理的脑部MRI图像，这限制了MRI研究中对细微形态差异的探索。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二值掩码，使用ControlNet 3D扩展编码掩码，约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最终通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑部MRI。

Conclusion: PCGM是合成MRI在研究细微形态差异方面应用的重要里程碑，为脑部MRI研究提供了高质量的图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

TL;DR: 提出一种利用固定物体信息和多任务学习方法的人体动作识别方法，在人与固定物体交互识别任务上达到99.25%的准确率，比仅使用人体骨架的基准模型提升2.75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图卷积神经网络在人体动作识别中表现良好，但在检测人与物体交互场景时效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏有效的场景信息表示和合适的学习架构。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，考虑环境中固定物体的信息，并结合交互区域信息来提升识别性能。收集了包含手部与固定物体交互（如ATM机、值机设备等）以及行走、站立等非交互动作的数据集。

Result: 提出的方法在识别研究的交互和非交互动作上达到了99.25%的准确率，相比仅使用人体骨架姿态的基准模型提升了2.75%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过引入固定物体信息和多任务学习架构，能够有效提升人与固定物体交互动作的识别性能，解决了传统方法在场景信息表示方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

TL;DR: 提出IRDFusion框架，通过跨模态特征对比和筛选策略，实现高质量的多光谱目标检测特征融合，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时容易保留多余背景或噪声，限制了感知性能，需要新的融合框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出包含互特征精炼模块(MFRM)和差分特征反馈模块(DFFM)的统一框架。MFRM通过建模特征关系增强跨模态对齐能力，DFFM计算模态间差分特征作为指导信号并反馈给MFRM，实现自适应融合互补信息并抑制共模噪声。

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M³FD数据集上的大量实验表明，IRDFusion实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性场景中 consistently 优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代反馈机制渐进式放大显著关系信号并抑制特征噪声，实现了高质量的跨模态融合，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，阻碍实际部署。现有压缩方法采用临时性的量化或token剪枝，但无法同时实现两者以获得整体效率提升，因为观察到不兼容性问题。

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果。通过协同设计量化和token剪枝流程来克服不兼容性。

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现计算效率和推理速度的显著提升，成功保持核心模型性能，达到1.93倍加速，平均成功率相比原始模型提升高达4.5%。

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA框架成功解决了VLA模型量化与token剪枝的不兼容问题，实现了高效的推理加速，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖GPS或SLAM里程计获取地面真实位姿来监督网络训练，但高精度位姿获取成本高、工作量大，需要无需地面真实位姿的解决方案

Method: 基于BEV图像，利用关键点中心BEV补丁之间的已知地理距离构建训练三元组，使用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符，并引入SoftCos损失增强学习

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功消除了对地面真实位姿的依赖，提供了一种高度可扩展的自监督LiDAR全局定位解决方案，性能优于有监督方法

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了植物个体层次化分割的零样本挑战，展现了优异的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，将CLIP应用于行人表征学习，解决了数据稀缺和全局对比学习的局限性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在多样化视觉任务中表现强劲，但在行人表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：(i)缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉-语言数据；(ii)全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征，且对噪声文本标记敏感

Method: 1) 利用MLLM的上下文学习能力构建抗噪声数据管道，自动筛选和标注网络图像，创建包含500万高质量行人中心图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，基于梯度-注意力相似性分数自适应屏蔽噪声文本标记；3) 引入屏蔽标记预测目标，增强细粒度语义表征学习

Conclusion: 该研究通过协同的数据策展和模型架构改进，成功将CLIP应用于行人表征学习，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准上达到了最优性能

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本量的PET基础模型，直接在投影域工作，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，性能媲美大数据集训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，包含三项关键技术：1）Radon掩码增强策略生成20万+结构多样训练样本；2）正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3）透明医学注意力机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本实现高质量sinogram生成，性能与大数据集训练模型相当，支持低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等多种任务，内存使用低于24GB。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺和计算效率问题，为医学影像分析提供了高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络和持续同调这两种不同方法在从数据推断拓扑结构时的噪声鲁棒性，探索神经网络在拓扑分析中的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行比较，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: 神经网络在噪声环境下表现优于PH方法，这归因于神经网络能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验知识

Conclusion: 虽然仍处于发展阶段，但神经网络在结构噪声下的拓扑估计为持续同调提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集通过结构压力引导架构演进的重要作用，需要从数据集驱动的角度重新解读视频理解发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动的方法，分析运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次结构和多模态丰富性等数据集特征如何为模型施加归纳偏置，并重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的发展里程碑。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到一个连贯框架中，该调查既提供了全面的回顾性分析，又为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性路线图和实践设计指导。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过多尺度细胞-组织标注数据集，证明了结合细胞与组织相互作用能显著提升细胞检测模型性能，相比仅细胞检测方法F1分数提升达7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家在检查全玻片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换，以评估广泛的组织形态和精细的细胞细节。现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟这种行为并学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义，且缺乏多尺度重叠标注数据集。

Method: 创建包含673对来自306个TCGA全玻片图像的多器官数据集，提供重叠的细胞检测和组织分割标注。参与者开发了整合细胞-组织关系的模型，相比仅细胞检测的基线模型进行性能比较。

Result: 顶级参赛模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型，F1分数提升了高达7.99，显示出性能的显著改善。

Conclusion: 研究证明将多尺度语义整合到模型中对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，细胞-组织相互作用的理解能大幅提升传统细胞检测方法的性能。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++改进了RT-DETR模型的编码器，通过通道门控注意力上/下采样机制和CSP-PAC特征融合技术，在无人机图像小目标密集检测中实现了优越性能，同时保持实时检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要改进现有模型的编码器设计来提升检测性能。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)双路径机制，减少特征层传播误差并保留细节；2. 在特征融合中使用CSP-PAC技术，通过并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息，整合多尺度特征。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测方面表现出优越性能，同时保持了实时检测速度，计算复杂度没有增加。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，特别适用于无人机图像中的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

### [31] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，通过减少知识冗余和增强相关性来改善KB-VQA任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将检索到的知识增强模型，但忽略了知识冗余问题，这会向回答过程引入噪声

Method: 1) 从图像-问题对中提取关键部分创建低噪声查询；2) 使用大模型识别和提取有益的知识片段；3) 引入选择性知识集成策略，仅在模型缺乏置信度时整合知识

Result: 大量实验表明，该框架优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够获取准确且关键的知识，有效缓解冗余信息的影响

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出CWSSNet分类框架，结合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，在江西余干县实现了优异的地物分类性能，并在小样本训练条件下保持可靠性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在林业生态和精准农业等领域有重要应用价值，但高光谱图像波段多、维度高、光谱混合等特点导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet分类框架，集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作。

Result: 在余干县实验中，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，训练集比例为70%时训练时间增加有限且分类效果接近最优。

Conclusion: CWSSNet模型突破了传统方法的分类性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性，在小样本训练条件下仍能保持可靠的性能表现，为高光谱图像地物分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

### [34] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的Dark-ISP插件，直接处理RAW图像来改善低光环境下的物体检测性能，通过异步优化传统ISP流程的线性和非线性模块，实现了更高效的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光环境下的物体检测面临图像质量降级的挑战。虽然RAW图像比RGB图像具有更好的潜力，但现有方法或使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂的框架。需要一种简单高效的方案来直接处理RAW图像。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为序列的线性模块（传感器校准）和非线性模块（音调映射），将其重构为可微分组件通过任务驱动损失进行优化。每个模块都具备内容自适应能力和物理信息先验知识。利用ISP流程的内在级联结构，设计了自动提升机制促进子模块之间的协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境下，以最少的参数量超越了现有的基于RGB和RAW的检测方法，达到了最优的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP插件提供了一种轻量级且自适应的方案，能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像，通过任务驱动的优化和自动提升机制，在低光物体检测任务中实现了端到端的高效训练和优异性能。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: 多粒度目标引导框架有效提升了人类轨迹预测的准确性，证明了中间粒度建模的重要价值

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Medverse提出了一个统一的3D医学影像上下文学习模型，通过多尺度渐进式框架和高效的注意力机制，成功实现了跨任务、跨器官、跨模态的通用医学图像分析，为医学影像的上下文学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是用于胃组织图像组织病理学分类的稳健架构，在二分类和多分类任务上均表现出色，具有辅助病理学家提高诊断准确性和减轻工作负荷的潜力。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,

*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DATE方法，通过时间戳注入和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，增强多模态大语言模型的长视频时间理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致时间信息丢失和理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)构建连续时间参考系统，以及时间感知相似性采样(TASS)策略，将视频采样重新定义为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在7B和72B模型上实现了小时级长视频基准测试的最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超越了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导采样，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的长视频时间理解和事件定位能力

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

TL;DR: PSP-Seg是一个渐进式剪枝框架，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失动态优化3D医学图像分割模型，在保持性能的同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割在临床环境中资源消耗大、部署困难的问题，现有静态模型难以平衡性能与效率。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是临床应用中具有成本效益的高性能替代方案，具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Code-as-Thought (CaT)方法，通过可验证的符号化代码表示图表视觉信息，并引入视觉可编程性概念，让VLM自适应选择代码推理或直接视觉推理路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解方法存在局限性：依赖外部工具导致脆弱性，或使用单一推理策略（如文本CoT）难以验证中间步骤，限制了强化学习信号的应用

Method: 采用自适应框架，VLM学习选择CaT路径（代码推理）或直接视觉推理路径。使用新颖的双奖励系统训练选择策略：数据准确性奖励防止数值幻觉，决策奖励教导模型何时使用每种策略

Result: 在多样化图表理解基准测试中展现出强大而鲁棒的性能

Conclusion: 研究表明VLMs不仅可以学习推理，还能学习如何推理，能够为每个任务动态选择最优推理路径

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态脑部MRI分割模型通常局限于固定的模态组合，无法有效处理推理时出现的新模态，或者泛化到未见模态时会丢失模态特异性信息

Method: 对U-net架构进行简单改进，集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道。通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态，差异化改变病变和健康组织的外观以创建人工对比度

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练时见过的模态，也能处理新的未见模态来改进分割效果

Conclusion: 该方法为脑部MRI分割提供了实用的解决方案，允许用户利用任何可用的成像模态，提高了模型的灵活性和实用性

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对基于嵌入的检测器的模型无关开放集检测框架，通过熵建模估计语义不确定性，结合谱归一化和温度缩放来增强开放集判别能力，在AOT航空基准和真实飞行测试中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统闭集检测器在域偏移和飞行数据损坏下性能显著下降，对安全关键应用构成风险，需要开发能够处理未知对象拒绝并保持鲁棒性的开放集检测方法。

Method: 提出模型无关的开放集检测框架，在嵌入空间中进行熵建模来估计语义不确定性，使用谱归一化和温度缩放技术增强开放集判别能力，同时通过背景拒绝机制提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在AOT航空基准和真实飞行测试中验证，相比标准YOLO基线方法获得高达10%的相对AUROC增益，背景拒绝机制在不影响检测精度的前提下进一步增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于动态空对空环境中的可靠无人机感知，为无人机自主性在真实世界条件下的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一种新颖的SAR图像目标表征学习框架，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制，在没有掩码标注的情况下实现目标与背景杂波的解耦，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）经常与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级槽注意力模块整合多级特征，增强槽表征的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SlotSAR在SAR图像处理中达到了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波的解耦问题，为无监督目标表征学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Conclusion: 现有MLLMs对真实世界材料表征场景的适应性仍然有限，MatCha基准将促进新材料发现和自主科学代理等领域的未来研究

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上表现优异，在多种异构场景下达到强性能，仅用少量无标签数据即可媲美全数据集训练的SOTA方法

Conclusion: PHCP提供了一种实用的异构协同感知解决方案，无需联合训练即可在推理时直接处理模型异构问题

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Motivation: 手术技能评估需要专家标注，成本高昂且稀缺，因此需要探索少样本学习方法。但少样本学习的成功依赖于有效的预训练策略，而这在手术技能评估领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将手术技能评估构建为少样本任务，评估不同自监督预训练策略的效果。使用OSATS评分标注公开可用的机器人手术数据集，并在三种少样本设置下评估各种预训练来源。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集表现优于大规模但不相关的数据集，在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。加入手术特定数据可平均提升1.22%准确率和2.28% F1分数。

Conclusion: 预训练数据的领域相关性比规模更重要，在领域相关数据集基础上加入手术特定数据能显著提升少样本手术技能评估性能，但不相关的预训练数据反而会降低性能。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动的两阶段框架，通过结合眼地超声视频处理和临床数据融合，实现了高准确的非侵入性内项压力分级评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的骨枱穿刻ICP监测方法侵入性强、风险高，而现有的非侵入性ONSD测量方法存在手工操作不一致、主观性强和阈值变异性等问题，影响了可靠性。

Method: 采用全自动两阶段框架：第一阶段进行眼底超声视频处理，包括帧级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别和精确ONSD测量；第二阶段将ONSD指标与临床特征融合，预测ICP分级。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在五折交叉验证中获得0.845±0.071的准确率，独立测试集准确率为0.786，显著超过传统阈值方法（0.637±0.111验证准确率，0.429测试准确率）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效减少操作变异性和融合多源信息，建立了一种可靠的非侵入性ICP评估方法，有望改善急性神经疾病患者的管理。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Motivation: IC制造中存在多样化细粒度缺陷影响良率，现有方法依赖外部正常样本对比，但对IC图像布局多变且对齐困难的情况不够鲁棒

Method: 使用可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像聚合代表性正常特征，通过一致性损失确保与正常区域关联，解码器重建正常内容，用重建残差分割缺陷，采用伪异常增强稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC工艺阶段数据集上实验显示相比现有方法有持续改进，对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部正常支持，能有效处理IC图像中的局部缺陷分割问题，具有良好的实用性和适应性

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: DRiFt框架为构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉-语言模型提供了重要见解，通过特征解耦和跨模态对齐提高了模型的可靠性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过语义引导和清晰度感知机制，有效解决了多模态图像融合与超分辨率的联合问题，为实际应用提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了密集自监督学习中的过分散问题，通过显式语义集中和对象感知机制显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了广泛应用。传感器3D超声使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计3D探头轨迹是一个有前景的替代方案，但现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法稳健建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络（如2D CNN或基础模型）和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖关系；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取，有效解决了传感器3D超声成像中的关键挑战，为低成本、高性能的3D超声成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

TL;DR: InterAct是一个大规模3D人-物交互基准数据集，通过整合21.81小时数据并优化质量，扩展到30.70小时，包含详细文本标注和六个基准任务，用于推进3D人-物交互生成研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-物交互数据集存在接触穿透、漂浮和不正确手部动作等伪影问题，且缺乏高质量的运动和标注数据，限制了3D人-物交互建模和生成的发展。

Method: 提出统一的优化框架，基于接触不变性原理减少伪影并校正手部动作，同时保持人-物关系并引入运动变化；整合和标准化来自多个来源的21.81小时HOI数据，并丰富详细的文本标注。

Result: 将数据集扩展到30.70小时，定义了六个基准任务，开发了统一的HOI生成建模视角，实现了最先进的性能，并通过广泛实验验证了数据集的实用性。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集作为推进3D人-物交互生成的基础资源具有重要价值，数据集已公开并提供持续维护，支持该领域的持续研究。

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于深度学习的阿尔茨海默病MRI诊断中存在的种族和性别捷径学习与偏见问题，通过多数据集和多模型实验证实了这种偏见的存在，并为开发更公平的诊断工具奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部影像诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测。当这些特征与受保护属性（如种族和性别）相关时，会导致对弱势群体的性能偏见。

Method: 研究使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等深度学习模型，通过以下步骤进行分析：1）验证模型是否能从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别；2）检查训练集种族或性别不平衡是否导致模型性能下降；3）对不同脑区域的特征归因进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习和偏见。模型能够识别受保护属性，且训练集不平衡会导致性能下降，证实了偏见的存在。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了深度学习在医学影像诊断中的潜在偏见问题，为开发更公平的脑MRI诊断工具提供了重要基础，强调了在医疗AI应用中需要考虑公平性和偏见缓解策略。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多时相多源遥感影像中伪变化普遍、标记样本稀缺以及跨域泛化困难的问题。

Method: 采用权重共享的Siamese编码器，集成LoRA和Adapter模块，仅训练少量额外参数，使用SAM2和DINOv3作为骨干网络，配合轻量级解码器。

Result: 在SYSU-CD(IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD(92.05%)、MSRSCD(64.07%)、MLCD(76.89%)、CDD(97.01%)、S2Looking(52.25%)和LEVIR-CD(85.62%)等多个数据集上达到最先进性能，具有精确边界划分和强伪变化抑制能力。

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFM适应真实遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级精度和抗运动模糊的优势，但在与自然语言理解的多模态融合方面研究不足，存在感知空白。

Method: 构建基于真实驾驶场景的大规模数据集，包含13,458个标注对象，每个指代表达式都包含外观、状态、与观察者关系、与周围对象关系四个结构化属性。

Result: 创建了包含丰富空间、时间和关系线索的基准数据集，支持超越简单目标识别的上下文推理。

Conclusion: Talk2Event为推进多模态和时序感知研究奠定了基础，在机器人、人机交互等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和逼真肖像生成相结合，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟形象生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将指令条件视为由音频或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，而没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这影响了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）导演生成蓝图视频，控制角色动作和情感等高级语义；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇形同步精度、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为基于语义的高保真音频驱动虚拟形象合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

<details>

Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学的临床决策至关重要，特别是在数据有限的情况下需要生物信息化的图像生成方法。

Method: 使用常微分方程系统的机制模型捕捉肿瘤动态和放疗效应，估计未来肿瘤负担；通过梯度引导的DDIM进行图像合成，确保与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐。

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个纵向儿童弥漫性中线胶质瘤病例上评估，生成具有空间相似度指标的逼真随访扫描，并提供肿瘤生长概率图。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限的情况下实现了生物信息化的图像生成，提供了考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测，能够捕捉临床相关的肿瘤生长范围和方向性。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件中的关键空白，通过显式错误选项拒绝机制，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更真实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Motivation: 建立统一的多模态学习范式，通过重建保真度目标协调视觉理解和图像生成两个过程，使其相互促进

Method: 提出UAE框架：1）使用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器；2）设计Unified-GRPO强化学习三阶段训练：冷启动初始化、生成促进理解、理解促进生成

Conclusion: 揭示了多模态学习中的惊喜发现：通过强化学习进展，理解和生成能力相互增强，实现了显著的重建保真度提升

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Conclusion: NRMF通过严格的几何建模和创新的算法设计，为3D人体运动恢复提供了一个强大且通用的先验模型

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Motivation: 现有研究认为扩散模型中的局部性是由卷积神经网络的归纳偏置造成的，但本文质疑这一观点，旨在探索局部性特性的真正来源。

Method: 通过分析最优参数化线性去噪器的特性，结合理论和实验验证，证明局部性源于图像数据集的像素相关性，并据此构建新的解析去噪器。

Result: 研究发现最优参数化线性去噪器表现出与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性特性，且这种局部性直接来源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性。新构建的解析去噪器比现有方法更匹配深度扩散模型的预测分数。

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性本质上是图像数据集的统计特性，而非网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现为理解和改进扩散模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered

TL;DR: 提出了CameraVDP框架，结合相机重建流程和视觉差异预测器，用于显示器的感知质量评估，能够检测像素缺陷、颜色边缘和显示不均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于稀疏辐射采样的显示测量方法无法捕捉空间变化的显示伪影和高频失真，而相机测量存在光学和光度失真，需要结合视觉系统模型来评估可见性。

Result: 通过三个应用验证框架有效性：缺陷像素检测、颜色边缘感知和显示不均匀性评估。不确定性分析框架能够估计缺陷像素检测性能的理论上限，并为VDP质量分数提供置信区间。

Conclusion: CameraVDP框架成功将相机转化为精确的显示测量仪器，能够进行感知质量评估，为显示器质量控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

TL;DR: 提出使用神经网络求解无限维全变差最小化问题的新方法，通过引入辅助神经网络问题解决原始问题无解的理论障碍，并证明其Γ-收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络方法在求解偏微分方程方面表现良好，但直接应用于无限维全变差最小化问题时存在无解的理论问题，需要开发新的理论框架。

Method: 构建辅助神经网络问题确保解的存在性，提出离散版本并证明其Γ-收敛性，将离散神经网络问题与有限差分离散化建立联系。

Conclusion: 通过Γ-收敛理论成功解决了神经网络求解无限维全变差问题的理论障碍，为神经网络在该领域的应用提供了坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve
partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like
physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular.
In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional
total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that
the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To
circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network
problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense
of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical
solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network
problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original
infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof
suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we
connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference
discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization
problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical
findings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于神经科学原理的计算框架，旨在提升智能体的空间推理能力，通过六个核心计算模块来弥合当前AI系统与人类空间智能之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的AI系统在自主任务执行和语言推理方面取得进展，但空间推理能力仍然有限，主要局限于符号和顺序处理。而人类的空间智能基于多感官感知、空间记忆和认知地图，能够在非结构化环境中进行灵活的上下文感知决策。

Method: 提出了一个基于神经科学原理的计算框架，包含六个核心模块：仿生多模态感知、多感官整合、自我中心-异中心转换、人工认知地图、空间记忆和空间推理。通过对现有方法的框架指导分析，评估其与各模块的相关性并识别关键差距。

Result: 建立了一个跨虚拟和物理环境的智能体空间推理能力视角图景，分析了新兴基准测试和数据集，探索了从虚拟到具身系统（如机器人）的潜在应用领域。

Conclusion: 论文为研究社区提供了一个基于神经科学的视角和结构化路径，有望推动空间推理在动态或非结构化环境中的泛化能力发展，促进智能体与物理3D世界更好的交互。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

TL;DR: 提出基于可解释AI的数据驱动框架，从15个特征中优化出8个特征子集，将神经突交换成像扫描时间从长时间缩短至14分钟，保持参数精度和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散MRI神经突交换成像模型需要长时间扫描，限制了其在神经科学和临床研究中的广泛应用，因此需要开发更高效的采集方案。

Method: 使用可解释人工智能和引导式递归特征消除策略，从完整15特征协议中识别最优8特征子集，并在体内验证性能。

Result: 优化协议产生的参数估计和皮层图与完整协议相当，合成数据中估计误差低，测试-重测变异性影响最小，水交换时间估计偏差减少两倍以上。

Conclusion: 这种混合优化框架可在14分钟内实现可行的神经突交换成像，且不损失参数保真度，为生物物理参数映射中设计高效采集协议提供了通用方法。

Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework
for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

TL;DR: DiFlow-TTS是首个基于纯离散流匹配的零样本文本转语音模型，通过分解式流预测机制和上下文学习，实现了高质量语音合成，推理速度比现有基线快25.8倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本TTS中现有方法推理速度慢、存在重复伪影的问题，充分利用离散表示的潜力，避免将离散token嵌入连续空间带来的局限性

Method: 采用纯离散流匹配方法，在紧凑统一架构中显式建模分解的语音属性。利用上下文学习，基于文本内容和参考语音提取的韵律、声学属性进行条件生成，使用分解式流预测机制分别处理韵律和声学细节

Conclusion: DiFlow-TTS证明了纯离散流匹配在语音合成中的有效性，为高效高质量的零样本TTS提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本文通过将LRP型归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，建立了与雅可比矩阵乘法的类比，推导了奇异值上界和归因图值的分量界，并获得了控制经验均值收敛到期望的乘性常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LRP型归因方法的数值特性，特别是研究归因值分布和收敛性质，为多数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型方法提供理论支撑。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵乘积，建立与雅可比矩阵链式法则的类比，推导奇异值上界和分量界，获得控制收敛的乘性常数。

Result: 发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这是与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon的重要区别，对多数据增强和Smoothgrad型方法有重要影响。

Conclusion: LRP-beta在收敛性质上具有独特优势，其常数独立于权重范数，这为实际应用中选择合适的归因方法提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了深度学习天气模型评估指标存在的"统计相似性陷阱"，并提出DART框架来解决这一问题。DART通过双解码器架构、物理驱动的过采样和任务特定损失函数，显著提升了极端对流检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习天气模型的评估指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，倾向于奖励模糊的预测而忽略了罕见但高影响的极端天气事件。这导致模型在实际应用中无法有效检测危险的对流活动。

Method: 提出了DART（双架构回归任务）框架，采用双解码器架构进行背景/极端分解，结合物理驱动的过采样技术和任务特定的损失函数，将粗粒度大气预报转换为高分辨率卫星亮度温度场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测方面取得显著改进：CSI达到0.273，偏差为2.52（基线为6.72）；去除集成水汽输送(IVT)使检测性能提升270%；训练时间少于10分钟，并可无缝集成到现有气象工作流中。

Conclusion: DART是首个系统解决混合转换-分割-降尺度任务的框架，通过专门化设计有效规避了统计相似性陷阱，为极端天气预警提供了可信的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的图对齐框架，通过双通编码器和几何感知功能映射模块同时增强节点区分度并确保跨图潜在空间的几何一致性，在无监督图对齐任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有无监督图对齐方法存在两个关键问题：GNN嵌入中的过度平滑导致节点区分度降低，以及结构噪声、特征异质性和训练不稳定性导致的潜在空间错位，最终导致不可靠的节点对应关系。

Method: 采用双通编码器结合低通和高通谱滤波器生成既结构感知又高度区分的嵌入，并引入几何感知功能映射模块学习图嵌入之间的双射等距变换，确保跨表示的一致几何关系。

Result: 在图基准测试中始终优于现有无监督对齐基线，对结构不一致性和具有挑战性的对齐场景表现出卓越的鲁棒性。在视觉-语言基准测试中也能有效泛化，实现视觉和语言表示的无监督对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时解决节点区分度和潜在空间对齐问题，为跨图节点对应识别提供了一种有效的无监督解决方案，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，通过整合动态结构参数来预测特发性全层黄斑裂孔患者术后视力恢复情况。研究显示动态参数和多模态方法的结合显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的术后视力恢复预测方法主要依赖静态参数，缺乏对术后恢复过程中动态变化的考量。为了更准确地预测特发性全层黄斑裂孔患者的术后视力恢复，需要开发能够整合动态参数和多模态数据的预测模型。

Method: 使用公开的纵向OCT数据集，开发阶段特异性分割模型和自动化特征提取流程，提取定量、复合、定性和动态特征。构建二元逻辑回归模型和多模态深度学习模型，结合临床变量、OCT衍生特征和原始OCT图像进行预测。

Result: 分割模型在所有时间点均达到高精度（平均Dice > 0.89）。动态恢复率的加入显著提升了逻辑回归模型的AUC，特别是在3个月随访时。多模态深度学习模型在所有阶段都优于逻辑回归模型，AUC差异最高达0.12。

Conclusion: 将动态参数整合到多模态深度学习模型中显著提高了预测准确性，这种全自动化流程为黄斑裂孔手术的个性化术后管理提供了一个有前景的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

TL;DR: 本研究将虚拟染色技术扩展到X射线领域，通过跨模态图像转换从同步辐射微CT扫描生成人工染色切片，实现无需物理切片或化学染色的3D组织表征。

Conclusion: 该工作首次将虚拟染色引入3D X射线成像，为生物医学研究提供了一种可扩展的、化学信息丰富的无标记组织表征途径，尽管在植入物降解层描绘方面仍需进一步数据完善。

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈在于系数计数困难，其次是变量识别和多步推理的复合错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要感知与符号计算结合的任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解这一具体问题。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析每个环节的表现和错误来源。

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈；多步推理引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础数学推理方面存在关键弱点，需要改进计数能力、多步推理和复杂符号处理能力。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: OmniEVA是一个新型的多模态具身智能规划器，通过任务自适应的3D接地机制和具身感知推理框架，解决了现有MLLM系统在几何适应性和物理约束方面的局限性。


<details>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物体相对控制的视觉导航新范式ObjectReact，通过物体级表示替代传统的图像级表示，实现了对姿态和具身变化的更高不变性，在跨传感器高度和反向导航等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像相对控制的视觉导航方法受限于图像与智能体姿态和具身的严格绑定，限制了其泛化能力。物体作为地图的属性，能够提供更具不变性的世界表示。

Method: 提出了基于相对3D场景图的拓扑地图表示，用于获取更丰富的物体级全局路径规划代价。训练了一个本地控制器ObjectReact，直接以高层WayObject代价图表示为条件，无需显式RGB输入。

Result: 在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中，物体相对控制方法相比图像相对控制表现出明显优势，特别是在反向导航等挑战空间理解能力的任务中。仅使用仿真训练的策略能够很好地泛化到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 物体相对控制范式具有更好的泛化性和不变性，能够在不严格模仿先验经验的情况下遍历新路线，为视觉导航提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: Dexplore是一个统一单循环优化方法，直接从运动捕捉数据学习机器人控制策略，通过联合执行重定向和跟踪，将不完美演示转化为有效的灵巧操作训练信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手-物体运动捕捉库提供大规模接触丰富的演示，但演示不准确和人机手之间的具身差距限制了这些数据的直接使用。现有三阶段工作流程导致演示利用不足和误差累积。

Method: 统一单循环优化，联合执行重定向和跟踪；将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值；从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围；使用强化学习训练策略保持在范围内同时最小化控制努力和完成任务。

Result: 统一表述保留演示意图，使机器人特定策略涌现，提高对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示语料库。最终将跟踪策略蒸馏为基于视觉的技能条件生成控制器。

Conclusion: Dexplore作为原则性桥梁，将不完美演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨对象泛化和现实世界部署。

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

### [95] [Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973)
*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过在不同分辨率下应用深度学习网络，找到了锥束CT散射伪影校正的最佳分辨率方案，显著降低了计算量和内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锥束CT扫描中的散射伪影严重降低图像质量，虽然基于深度学习的方法在散射估计方面表现出潜力，但由于网络内存占用大，在移动CBCT系统或边缘设备上的部署仍然受限。

Method: 首先在六个分辨率下检查CBCT散射信号的下上采样重建误差，比较四种插值方法；然后在五个图像分辨率上训练最新的最先进方法，评估浮点运算、推理时间和GPU内存需求的减少。

Result: 输入大小和网络参数的减少使FLOPs相比基线方法减少了78倍，同时保持了可比的MAPE（3.85% vs 4.42%）和MSE（1.34×10⁻² vs 2.01×10⁻²）性能。推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少了16倍和12倍。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在基于深度学习的散射估计中下采样的被低估的作用。通过该方法实现的FLOPs和GPU内存需求的大幅减少，使得在资源受限环境（如移动CBCT和边缘设备）中进行散射校正成为可能。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.
