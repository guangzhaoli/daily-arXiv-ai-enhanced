### [1] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CLIP感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的水下图像增强方法，显著提升了视觉质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像质量受光吸收和散射影响，现有深度学习方法忽视人类感知且约束不足，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力，学习适当的提示对来评估图像质量，并结合课程对比正则化增强约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化的方法有效提升了水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

### [2] [SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06265)
*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重构损失，学习跨模型和模态的统一潜在空间，显著提高了概念对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如稀疏自编码器）为每个模型生成独立的潜在概念，导致概念空间不兼容，限制了跨模型的可解释性。

Method: SPARC引入全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重构损失，强制不同模型和模态共享统一的潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images数据集上，SPARC将概念对齐的Jaccard相似度提高到0.80，是之前方法的三倍以上。

Conclusion: SPARC实现了跨模型和模态的共享稀疏潜在空间，支持直接比较不同架构对相同概念的表示，并支持文本引导的空间定位等应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/SPARC.

### [3] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF是一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和对几何不确定性的了解，现有方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似和基于Hessian的度量来量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效且表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: BayesSDF在校准和几何一致性方面优于现有方法，提供了可操作的下游应用置信度测量。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

### [4] [LIRA: Inferring Segmentation in Large Multi-modal Models with Local Interleaved Region Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06272)
*Zhang Li,Biao Yang,Qiang Liu,Shuo Zhang,Zhiyin Ma,Shuo Zhang,Liang Yin,Linger Deng,Yabo Sun,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和理解任务中的不准确和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在视觉理解弱和细粒度感知不足的问题，LIRA旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: LIRA包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少理解幻觉。

Result: 实验表明LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并引入AttrEval数据集量化语义推断能力。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Motivation: 离线手写文本识别系统在历史文档数字化等领域至关重要，但训练数据不足（尤其是低资源语言和复杂脚本）限制了其性能。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法，系统分析了传统数据增强技术和深度学习方法（如GANs、扩散模型和基于Transformer的方法）。

Result: 从1,302项研究中筛选出848项进行分析，评估了现有数据集、评估指标和先进方法，揭示了研究空白。

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于提升多类分割模型的训练效果，特别是在火灾类分割任务中。该方法通过集中复制粘贴火灾区域来增加数据集多样性，显著提升了火灾类分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于收集和标注图像用于训练分割模型成本高昂，且在野外火灾科学领域，可靠的公开数据集稀缺，因此需要一种有效的数据增强方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三个步骤：(i) 识别源图像中的火灾区域，(ii) 应用集中化技术聚焦火灾核心区域，(iii) 将精炼后的火灾区域粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: 通过数值分析和多目标优化方法验证，CCPDA在火灾类分割任务中表现优于其他数据增强方法，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: CCPDA方法有效缓解了小型手动标注数据集的训练困难，尤其在火灾类分割任务中表现出色，优于其他增强策略。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs）来提升预训练CNN的鲁棒性，无需架构改动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，影响实际应用可靠性。

Method: AR2采用CAM对齐和迭代修复策略，结合CAM引导的细化和标准微调。

Result: AR2在多个标准损坏基准测试中优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据准确性和损坏鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为提升模型在现实环境中的可靠性提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物阻抗传感在细粒度运动捕捉中具有独特优势，但缺乏标记数据限制了其应用。

Method: 提出模拟管道生成逼真生物阻抗信号，并设计两阶段训练策略，无需标签对齐的合成数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率和F1分数分别提升22.3%和21.8%。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

TL;DR: PCL-Former是一种基于多阶段Transformer架构的时序动作定位方法，通过三个专用模块分别处理候选段、分类和边界定位，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Transformer和多阶段架构在视频识别和目标检测中的成功启发，探索其在时序动作定位任务中的应用。

Method: 提出PCL-Former，包含Proposal-Former、Classification-Former和Localization-Former三个模块，每个模块有专用损失函数。

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别超越现有方法2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过多阶段Transformer架构有效提升了时序动作定位的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

*Soroush Shahi,Farzad Shahabi,Rama Nabulsi,Glenn Fernandes,Aggelos Katsaggelos,Nabil Alshurafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热感技术捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据处理量和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续处理RGB图像能耗高、数据量大且涉及隐私问题，需要更高效的实时分析方法。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热感线索定位感兴趣区域以减少处理量。

Result: 仅使用3%的原始RGB数据即可实现95%的活动识别准确率，与全视频处理（94%）相当。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动提供了更实用的解决方案，适用于长期健康行为监控。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件自动编码器架构，用于高效压缩和重建事件数据，提升实时边缘计算中的事件视觉性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统在动态环境中存在运动模糊、高延迟和数据冗余问题，事件相机虽能捕捉异步亮度变化，但稀疏和噪声事件流对目标检测构成挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，以降低计算复杂度并提高识别精度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8-44.8 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升事件视觉性能，适合低功耗、高速的实时边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

TL;DR: Video-RTS通过结合数据高效的强化学习和视频自适应测试时间缩放策略，显著提升了视频推理能力的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅使用3.6%的训练样本，平均准确率提升2.4%。

Conclusion: Video-RTS的纯强化学习训练和自适应视频测试时间缩放策略互补，实现了强大的推理性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在提取具有区分性的姿态感知特征时遇到困难，尤其是在目标被遮挡的情况下。

Method: 结合姿态感知的2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，用于基于重建的模型预训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于之前的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过引入额外的模态信息和对象聚焦的预训练损失函数，有效提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

*Yupeng Hu,Changxing Ding,Chang Sun,Shaoli Huang,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双边协作框架（BC-HOI），用于开放词汇人-物交互检测，通过注意力偏差引导和LLM监督提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）的粗粒度特征，与检测任务需求不符，需要更细粒度的交互表示。

Method: BC-HOI框架包含注意力偏差引导（ABG）和LLM监督引导（LSG），分别优化VLM和HOI检测器的特征生成与监督。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，开放和封闭场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BC-HOI通过双边协作有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测的性能，解决了VLM特征粒度不足的问题。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Abstract: Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have
significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To
facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in
traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks

taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups
that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories
and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related
fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the
analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The
cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the
aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and
recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving
field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic
resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

Conclusion: FIFA和后校正框架有效解决了VideoMLLMs中的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的忠实性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与生成能力保留，存在安全风险。

Method: 提出KSCU方法，针对扩散模型的关键步骤进行微调，减少参数更新。

Result: 实验表明KSCU能有效阻止不良图像生成，同时保留模型生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为文本到图像扩散模型的安全使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋人和听力障碍者更轻松地交流，填补了从英语语音到手语动画这一被忽视的研究空白。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，MarianMT模型将文本翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，并通过3D关键点运动系统生成动画。

Result: 系统在BLEU评分上表现优异（0.7714和0.8923），并创建了新的数据集Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个从语音到动画的完整框架，优于以往专注于单一数据类型的系统。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: ILNet通过逆学习和动态锚点选择，有效提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布，且参数更少。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了数据标注需求，提升了野生动物监测效率。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景的时序依赖，且在不同模型规模下具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其广泛使用引发了版权和透明度问题。现有方法无法识别对特定元素（如风格或对象）的贡献，因此需要更细粒度的归因方法。

Method: 提出了Concept-TRAK方法，通过两种创新实现概念级归因：(1) 基于扩散后验采样的训练损失函数；(2) 强调语义相关性的概念感知奖励函数。

Result: 在AbC基准测试中，Concept-TRAK显著优于现有方法，并通过案例研究展示了其在识别受保护内容、分析提示工程等方面的实用性。

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成式AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Motivation: 现有方法主要捕获成对关系，未能建模所有视图的联合结构。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，且与余弦相似度有理论联系。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了边缘附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EBT损失函数在定量和感知上均优于WBCE，且超参数鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: EBT损失函数易于部署，性能优越，是边缘检测任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Result: MOST在文本到运动检索和生成方面达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度匹配和消除冗余，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过自适应模糊性估计和优化训练，显著提升了3D语义分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Motivation: HDR视频重建中，交替曝光方法导致的参考图像曝光波动常引起闪烁问题，需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了DCS在HDR视频重建中的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的DCS和EAFNet有效解决了HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Motivation: 长期动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉混淆因素而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预实现了鲁棒的动作表示，为长期动作识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through

*Qing Zhang,Guoquan Pei,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Fuse是一种新型的空间-光谱全融合网络，用于高光谱图像分割，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中具有潜力，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Omni-Fuse网络，包含跨维度增强模块、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个显微高光谱图像数据集上，Omni-Fuse的DSC指标比现有方法提高了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse通过高效的特征融合机制，显著提升了高光谱图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

*Yang Chen,Yueqi Duan,Haowen Sun,Ziwei Wang,Jiwen Lu,Yap-Peng Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视点依赖投影（VDP）的点云分割方法，通过动态适应不同视角的几何变化，生成高效的单图像输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投影方法依赖预定义参数，无法捕捉不同视角的多样性，且多投影导致计算冗余。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成投影，并引入颜色正则化优化特征表达。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP为语义理解提供了资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

TL;DR: EXAONE Path 2.0是一种病理学基础模型，通过直接使用幻灯片级监督学习补丁级表示，显著提高了数据效率，并在10种生物标志物预测任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有补丁级自监督学习方法可能忽略复杂领域特定特征，且数据效率低，需要大量计算资源。

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0采用幻灯片级监督学习补丁级表示，仅需37k WSIs进行训练。

Result: 在10种生物标志物预测任务中达到最先进性能，数据效率显著。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0通过直接幻灯片级监督解决了现有方法的局限性，展示了高效的数据利用和卓越性能。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Motivation: 医学领域中稀疏标注学习是一个常见挑战，尤其是需要密集像素级标注的任务。本文旨在解决这一问题，推动在标注不完美情况下的研究进展。

Method: 将问题建模为稀疏热图回归，并提出新的损失函数（Crag and Tail loss），以高效利用稀疏标注并减少假阴性或遗漏标注的影响。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在2D腹腔镜视频帧中实现了准确的致癌关键点定位，展示了其在稀疏标注场景下的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在密集标注难以获取的情况下具有重要研究价值，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学体积数据的可视化对诊断和手术规划至关重要，但现有方法在交互性和渲染效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出ClipGS框架，包括可学习的截断方案和自适应调整模型，以动态调整高斯原语的可见性和变形。

Result: 在五种医学数据上验证，平均PSNR为36.635，帧率为156 FPS，模型大小为16.1 MB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上表现优异，适用于医学数据的交互式可视化。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P 是一种基于扩散先验的全可微分图像到点云（I2P）配准框架，通过控制侧分数蒸馏（CSD）和可变形对应调整（DCT）模块，显著提高了配准性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽略了图像和点云数据之间的固有模态差距，导致跨模态对应不准确。

Method: 提出 Diff$^2$I2P，利用扩散先验和 CSD 技术优化变换预测，并通过 DCT 模块和可微分 PnP 求解器实现可微分的对应估计。

Result: 在 7-Scenes 基准测试中，Diff$^2$I2P 的配准召回率比现有方法提高了 7% 以上。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P 通过扩散先验引导跨模态特征学习，显著提升了 I2P 配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在贝叶斯推断框架中结合去噪和似然引导步骤，但两者在生成过程中的交互未被充分研究，导致不稳定性和性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，SPGD显著提高了生成稳定性，在定量指标和视觉结果上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理有效解决了扩散模型在图像恢复中的不稳定性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Conclusion: MK-Pose通过多模态融合和图增强特征，显著提升了类别级物体姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

Motivation: 现有压缩方法需要大量重新训练或微调，缺乏灵活性，难以适应不同压缩需求。

Method: 采用混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，无需重新训练即可适应不同压缩目标。

Result: 压缩比高达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），在移动设备上可部署，速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian提供了一种灵活、高效的3D高斯压缩解决方案，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Result: 在FSC-147等标准基准测试中表现出强大的零样本类无关计数泛化能力。

Conclusion: QUANet通过数量感知和双流设计显著提升了计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉适配器和提示学习的方法，利用部分最优传输（POT）和对比学习（CL）提升CLIP在医学图像异常检测中的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学异常检测面临成像模态多样、解剖变异大和标记数据有限等挑战，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 通过多提示学习与局部特征对齐（POT）捕捉细微异常，结合对比学习增强类内凝聚和类间分离。

Result: 在少样本、零样本和跨数据集场景中取得最先进结果，无需合成数据或记忆库。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像异常检测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

TL;DR: RPFNet是一种基于残差先验和频域感知的图像融合网络，通过双分支框架和频域卷积实现高效全局特征建模，显著提升融合图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像融合中长距离特征依赖计算成本高和缺乏真实数据的问题。

Method: 采用双分支框架（RPM和FDFM）和交叉促进模块（CPM），结合辅助解码器和对比损失优化训练。

Result: 实验验证RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强纹理细节，并提升高层视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet在图像融合中表现出色，为高层视觉任务提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度工业场景（如半导体制造）缺乏专用数据集，阻碍了复杂过程建模和预测的研究。

Method: 构建CHDL数据集，并提出DIFFUMA模型，结合Mamba模块和扩散模块以捕捉全局时序和增强细节。

Result: DIFFUMA在CHDL上MSE降低39%，SSIM提升至0.988，并在自然现象数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 工作不仅提供了SOTA模型，还为工业AI研究提供了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示复杂度的自适应缓存方法（PCA缓存），通过动态调整重用阈值和优化输入输出关系建模，显著提升了视频生成的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景中表现不佳，手动调整阈值效率低且缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种更智能的自适应方法。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示的语义复杂度动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出关系建模；引入动态CFGCache机制选择性重用输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍的加速，同时保持了高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存通过结合语义提示和动态机制，有效解决了视频生成中的速度与质量权衡问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Conclusion: 该研究为濒危语言OCR提供了可迁移框架，降低了数字人文学科的技术和财务门槛，使历史学家和语言学家无需专业计算资源即可处理历史档案。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing
resources. Code and model weights are available at

Result: 在矢状视角准确率达92.44%，优于其他方法，且在多视角中表现稳健。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined

specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

Conclusion: 合成热成像数据能有效扩展数据集，提升模型性能，尤其在低光或遮挡条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Motivation: 现有基于sRGB和HSV颜色空间的低光图像增强方法存在颜色偏差和噪声问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络，利用HV颜色图和可学习强度去除噪声，并结合预训练视觉语言模型和Prior-guided Attention Block进行内容恢复和颜色校正。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色失真和噪声问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Result: 在经典力学场景中成功恢复真实运动方程，生成的视频物理对齐优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频生成的物理准确性，无需微调现有模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Result: IAP在多种基准和模型上实现了高攻击成功率，同时显著提升补丁的隐形性。

Conclusion: IAP不仅对人类高度隐形，还能有效绕过多种先进补丁防御。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of
biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our
findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local
bez database with more than 238.000 biometric data sets categorized into
multiple biometric modalities such as face and finger. We used state-of-the-art
face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores. Our results
show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days
than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the
importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a
longer period of time in a controlled measurement environment and lays the
groundwork for future advancements in biometric data analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SemRaFiner的方法，用于稀疏雷达点云的全景分割，以增强场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头和LiDAR在恶劣天气下表现受限，且通常不提供运动信息，而雷达传感器能克服这些限制，但其测量数据稀疏且噪声较多。

Method: SemRaFiner方法考虑了稀疏雷达点云中密度的变化，优化了特征提取以提高准确性，并提出了一种优化的训练程序。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在雷达全景分割任务上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemRaFiner通过优化特征提取和训练程序，显著提升了雷达点云的全景分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

TL;DR: APL方法通过自适应部分发现和学习，提升GCD任务中判别性与泛化性的平衡，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法依赖DINO的全局表示，导致判别性与泛化性之间的固有权衡。

Method: APL通过共享可学习部分查询和DINO部分先验，生成一致的对象部分及其对应关系，并提出全最小对比损失。

Result: APL显著提升了细粒度数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: APL方法有效解决了GCD任务中的判别性与泛化性权衡问题。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多属性中国书法字符数据集（MCCD），填补了现有数据集稀缺且缺乏属性信息的空白，为书法研究提供了宝贵资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国书法字符的属性信息（如风格、朝代、书法家）具有重要文化和历史价值，但现有数据集稀缺且缺乏属性信息，限制了深入研究。

Method: 构建了包含7,765个类别、329,715个字符图像的MCCD数据集，并基于脚本风格、朝代和书法家属性提取了三个子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的笔画结构和属性交互显著增加了识别难度，MCCD为书法研究提供了多样化的任务支持。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为书法研究和多领域发展提供了资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 研究古代人类对热带森林的长期管理效应，特别是在高分辨率尺度上的影响。

Method: 使用深度学习模型识别卫星图像中的棕榈树，结合聚类算法分析棕榈树集群，并与考古遗址数据关联。

Result: 棕榈树在考古遗址附近显著更多，表明古代人类管理区域可能比考古证据显示的大两个数量级。

Conclusion: 古代人类通过管理植被促进了棕榈树的增殖，留下了持久的生态足迹，这为研究人类与环境的精细互动提供了新方法。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

TL;DR: CheXPO是一种针对胸部X光图像的偏好优化策略，通过结合置信度-相似性联合挖掘和反事实推理，解决了医学视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）存在幻觉问题，影响可靠性。传统偏好优化方法面临临床无关样本、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高等挑战。

Method: CheXPO通过合成多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集进行监督微调（SFT），利用置信度分析和相似性检索扩展困难样本，并通过反事实推理提供细粒度临床偏好。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本实现了8.93%的相对性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了一种可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的变形图像配准（DIR）在MR引导自适应放疗（MRgART）中至关重要，用于轮廓传播和剂量累积。本研究旨在开发一种能够跨领域工作的深度学习方法。

Method: ProRSeg方法通过加权分割一致性损失进行训练，并在相同领域、跨领域和混合领域的数据集上测试其性能，重点关注临床靶区（CTV）、膀胱和直肠的轮廓传播准确性。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出跨领域的泛化能力（DSC 0.88-0.86），而在直肠和CTV上表现依赖于领域。剂量累积结果显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现出合理性能，初步验证了其在评估治疗合规性方面的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全景感知，但数据采集复杂且耗时。现有方法无法实现高质量、可控的全景生成。

Method: 提出了局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）和概率提示方法（PPM），分别解决信息丢失和可控生成问题。

Result: 生成的数据在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升了下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Percep360在图像质量、可控性和实用性方面表现出色，为自动驾驶全景数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Conclusion: MassID45数据集在生态和机器学习领域具有创新潜力，推动快速、大规模的昆虫群落表征。

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Result: 在15个数据集的跨域和分布外设置中，FreeTTA表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA首次显式建模测试数据分布，无需同时访问样本，提升了灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且特征提取缺乏语义意识。

Method: MCA-RG利用病理库和解剖库对齐视觉特征，采用对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并通过特征门控机制过滤低质量特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现出色。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Motivation: NSCLC患者免疫治疗的预后预测对个性化治疗至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效的多模态特征融合方法。

Method: 构建大规模数据集，提出跨模态掩码学习框架，包括Slice-Depth Transformer（3D CT特征提取）和图Transformer（临床数据特征学习），通过掩码策略优化特征融合。

Result: 方法在多模态整合中表现优异，超越现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了NSCLC生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Conclusion: 格式奖励在多模态大语言模型中促进可迁移推理能力，为训练时推理深度与测试时响应灵活性解耦提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学和深度学习的快速发展为病理基础模型的出现提供了条件，同时空间转录组学技术的出现为从H&E染色图像中获取更细粒度的基因表达信息提供了可能。

Conclusion: 该方法为从H&E染色图像中高效预测细胞组成提供了一种可行且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Conclusion: MST-Distill通过动态教师模型和掩码模块有效解决了知识漂移问题，提升了跨模态知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS、时间戳和食物信息）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并引入了新数据集ACETADA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LLMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS、时间戳和食物信息等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如Chain-of-Thought），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，智能整合元数据可显著降低营养值预测的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步优化和应用。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱的效率较低，尤其在处理大规模CAD机械零件数据库或频繁质量检测时。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率等丰富网格特征，预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比线性FEM快约5倍，同时保持竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 证明了Laplace-Beltrami谱的可学习性，并提供公开数据集以支持可重复性。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确将像素测量转换为真实世界尺寸是计算机视觉中的基础挑战，限制了生物医学、法医学、营养分析和电子商务等关键应用的进展。

Method: RulerNet通过统一的关键点检测问题和几何级数参数表示标尺，结合合成数据管道和轻量级网络DeepGP，实现了高效且鲁棒的尺度估计。

Conclusion: RulerNet作为一种通用测量工具，具有与其他视觉组件集成的潜力，可用于高影响力领域的自动化、尺度感知分析。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Motivation: 现有T2I评估方法在评估丰富的实体-属性语义时存在局限性，尤其是属性混淆问题（属性正确但关联到错误实体）。

Method: 基于VQA定位策略，提出局部化人类评估协议和自动指标L-VQAScore，结合视觉定位和VQA探测正确与错误属性生成。

Result: 在新数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估相关性上优于现有方法，能有效捕捉细粒度实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是可靠且可扩展的替代主观评估的方法。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Result: 构建的模型性能媲美GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash，训练成本低于1000美元。

Conclusion: VLV框架显著降低了数据需求和训练成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration

paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and

Result: 在VQA和MLLM任务中表现优异，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在视觉理解中具有潜力，特别是在细粒度和空间推理任务中。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的分类问题（如植物识别）通常具有长尾分布，现有方法在长尾设置下无法同时保证预测集的小规模和良好的类别条件覆盖率。

Method: 提出了两种方法：一是基于宏覆盖率的prevalence-adjusted softmax评分函数，二是标签加权的共形预测方法，用于在边际和类别条件覆盖之间插值。

Result: 在Pl@ntNet和iNaturalist两个长尾图像数据集上验证了方法的有效性，分别包含1,081和8,142个类别。

Conclusion: 新方法在保证边际覆盖率的同时，灵活平衡了预测集大小和类别条件覆盖率，适用于长尾分布的分类问题。

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have
extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be
useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional
coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the
prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify
candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when
applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice
between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good
class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods
with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and
class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,
prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional
coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal
prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and
class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet
and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,
respectively.

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision
reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains
challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is
possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through
3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this
process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training
data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential
decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies
that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials,
lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to
generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training
strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by
pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning
the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models
pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results

*Wijayathunga W. M. R. D. B*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过将网格表示与3D高斯泼溅结合，增强非刚性3D模型变形能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅虽能实现快速实时辐射场渲染，但其后期编辑功能和对大规模非刚性变形的支持有限。

Method: 将高斯核直接嵌入到显式网格表面，利用网格的拓扑和几何先验指导直观的编辑操作。

Result: 支持复杂的变形（如弯曲和拉伸），并实现灵活的3D内容创建工作流。

Conclusion: 该框架为虚拟现实、角色动画和交互设计等应用提供了更灵活的3D内容创作工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by
bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional
Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its
post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations
remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian
kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent
topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such
as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables
complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for
more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual
reality, character animation, and interactive design.

TL;DR: 提出三个协作代理解决传统旅行规划系统的不足，显著提升查询解释、导航准确性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对环境变化和行程中断等现实复杂性。

Method: 设计三个代理：旅行规划代理（网格空间定位和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（精细导航）和本地发现代理（图像嵌入和RAG技术）。

Result: 系统在查询解释、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该系统适用于从城市探索到应急响应的多种应用场景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Motivation: 现有的病理学基础模型通常缺乏与单细胞分辨率分子数据的整合，限制了其在精准肿瘤学中的应用。

Method: PAST通过联合编码细胞形态和基因表达，学习跨模态的统一表征，支持单细胞基因表达预测、虚拟分子染色和多模态生存分析。

Result: PAST在多种癌症和下游任务中表现优于现有方法，展示了强大的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PAST为病理学基础模型建立了新范式，为高分辨率空间组学、机制发现和精准癌症研究提供了多功能工具。

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis,
they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution,
limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a
pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired
histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor
types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene
expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both
spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach
enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular
staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology
slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds
the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability
and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation
models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics,
mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“多表征”（polyrepresentation）的新概念，通过整合来自不同来源的同一模态的多种表征，提升了机器学习算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习算法的成功依赖于有意义的特征提取，而数据表示的质量是关键。然而，从未见过的数据集中有效泛化和提取特征同样重要。

Method: 提出多表征方法，整合来自不同来源的同一模态的多种表征（如Siamese Network的向量嵌入、自监督模型和可解释的放射组学特征）。

Result: 多表征方法在性能指标上优于单一表征，并在X射线图像中展示了其在小数据集上的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 多表征方法具有实用性和资源效率，适用于多种图像相关解决方案，且其概念可推广至其他领域。

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学图像处理中的多样性和数据变异性问题，提升分割效率和准确性。

Method: 采用两阶段分层设计：局部SMoE层进行特征提取，全局SMoE层进行信息融合和上下文优化。

Result: 在多种3D医学影像模态和数据质量下，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: HoME通过分层专家路由设计，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical
image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical
image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In
this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a
two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically
designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space
model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse,
adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts
(SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to
specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second
stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group
information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design,
combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves
generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art
results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging
modalities and data quality.

TL;DR: CCELLA++扩展了CCELLA，通过生成双参数前列腺MRI（bpMRI）并改进领域适应，提升了分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CCELLA仅支持AxT2序列、未研究跨机构领域偏移及偏重放射学结果的问题。

Method: 扩展CCELLA以生成bpMRI（包括AxT2、HighB和ADC），并研究领域适应策略。

Result: CCELLA++在HighB和ADC序列上表现优于CCELLA，且在领域适应场景中优于真实数据。

Conclusion: CCELLA++生成的合成bpMRI能提升分类器性能，未来需进一步优化样本质量和多序列训练。

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image
interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection
performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the
axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional
domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We
propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.
Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI
(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)
and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was
investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data
from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively
smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:
CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063
respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with
CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation
scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below
50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by
our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance
beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek
to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,
and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed
CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain
adaptation with a limited target institution dataset. Our code is available at

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic
interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D)
representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a
technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep
learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B
vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four
advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,
and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address
the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label
Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and
class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced
techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined
through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance
(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system
demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in
clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer
detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Motivation: 手动标注气道区域耗时且依赖专业知识，自动分割是快速支气管镜导航和机器人系统临床部署的前提。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，尤其在ATM22数据集上达到94.95%的最高分。

Conclusion: TfeNet在气道分割任务中表现出更高的准确性和连续性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is
therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the
clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional
neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway
segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for
conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine
airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address
this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,
named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation
that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling
positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then
represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular
feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and
residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway
structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two
datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed
TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions
compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest
overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,
Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung
fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at

From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based

TL;DR: Speckle2Self是一种自监督算法，用于仅使用单次噪声观测减少超声图像中的散斑噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像中的散斑噪声具有组织依赖性，传统方法如Noise2Noise和盲点网络无法处理。

Method: 通过多尺度扰动操作引入组织依赖性变化，将干净图像建模为低秩信号并分离稀疏噪声。

Result: 在模拟和真实超声图像上优于传统滤波器和SOTA学习方法，并展示了跨域适应性。

Conclusion: Speckle2Self为超声散斑噪声提供了一种有效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SimCortex优于现有方法，为神经解剖分析提供了更可靠的皮层表面重建。

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods
have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological
requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and
topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a
deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces
(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while
preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into
a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate
subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve
as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic
deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via
scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving
transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and
self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex
dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing
current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated
detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,
achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In
this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed
to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates
the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are
EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve
generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture
enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which
incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly
reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the
ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50
architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned
for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for
training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and
avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures
that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate
that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods
in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational
efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of
88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates
the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting
radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂神经网络存储大量突触权重的内存问题，适用于资源受限的边缘计算场景。

Method: 使用PCA降维和轻量级SVR模型预测权重，结合敏感性分析优先压缩CNN低敏感性层。

Result: FC层压缩53倍，AlexNet在MNIST上压缩28倍，CIFAR-10上压缩18倍，精度损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提高吞吐量并降低能耗，适合边缘应用。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了解耦与生成质量的权衡问题，同时支持灵活的潜在空间操作。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在处理多视图时存在四个关键局限性（如目标冲突、视图交互不足等），需要更高效的多视图对比学习框架。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，分别通过同时优化所有视图交互和解耦对齐与均匀性来解决现有问题。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上，新方法显著优于现有多视图方法，并能扩展到更多视图和模态。

Conclusion: MV-DHEL等方法有效解决了多视图对比学习的局限性，并实现了与监督学习类似的多视图优势。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

TL;DR: DCE框架通过频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器，解决了DIL中的类内不平衡和跨域分布偏移问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIL在非平稳环境中面临类内不平衡和跨域分布偏移的挑战，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出DCE框架，包括频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器，分别处理类内不平衡和跨域知识迁移。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，DCE表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCE有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，提升了模型在非平稳环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轨迹性能的模仿学习方法评估框架NeME，用于比较机器人控制策略，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估人形机器人性能复杂，传统成功率指标难以复现且无法捕捉运动轨迹的复杂性。

Method: 设计了NeME深度学习模型，通过分类机器人关节轨迹来评估模仿学习方法。

Result: 在ergoCub机器人上验证，NeME比基线方法更接近实际成功率。

Conclusion: NeME提供了一种可复现、系统化的方法，适用于复杂HRI任务中的模仿学习方法比较。

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

TL;DR: LOVON框架结合大语言模型和开放词汇视觉检测模型，解决开放世界中长距离物体导航的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以有效整合开放世界物体检测和高层次任务规划，限制了复杂长距离导航任务的能力。

Method: LOVON整合LLMs进行分层任务规划，并采用开放词汇视觉检测模型，设计了视觉稳定化和功能执行逻辑。

Result: 实验证明LOVON能成功完成涉及实时检测、搜索和导航的长序列任务，并在不同机器人上展示兼容性。

Conclusion: LOVON在动态非结构化环境中实现了高效的长距离物体导航，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.
