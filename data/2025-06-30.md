TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1 是一种新型视觉语言推理模型，通过 M3CTS 和 fDPO 方法提升细粒度空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 采用 M3CTS 生成多样化的长链思维推理轨迹，并通过 fDPO 引入细粒度偏好优化。

Result: fDPO 在空间质量任务上平均提升 4.1%，在空间数量任务上提升 9.0%。SpatialReasoner-R1 在 SPATIALRGPT-Bench 上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1 在细粒度空间推理任务中表现优异，同时保持通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

*Hakan Çapuk,Andrew Bond,Muhammed Burak Kızıl,Emir Göçen,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TanDiT是一种通过生成覆盖360°视图的切平面图像网格来合成全景场景的方法，解决了现有模型在全景图像生成中的几何失真和循环一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和循环一致性等挑战，TanDiT旨在解决这些问题并提升生成质量。

Method: TanDiT利用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中同时生成切平面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤以增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化到训练数据之外，处理复杂文本提示，并与多种生成模型结合生成高质量全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT通过创新方法解决了全景图像生成的挑战，并提供了专用评估指标和基准，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

### [3] [FOCUS: Internal MLLM Representations for Efficient Fine-Grained Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21710)
*Liangyu Zhong,Fabio Rosenthal,Joachim Sicking,Fabian Hüger,Thorsten Bagdonat,Hanno Gottschalk,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，利用MLLM内部表示指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉裁剪方法存在任务特定微调需求、低效搜索或与高效注意力实现不兼容等问题，FOCUS旨在解决这些不足。

Method: 通过四步实现：识别VQA提示中的目标对象、利用KV缓存计算对象相关性图、提出并排序相关图像区域、使用排名最高区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，计算效率提升3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过智能搜索策略，在保持高效的同时显著提升了细粒度VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

### [4] [CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711)
*Aryan Thakre,Omkar Nagwekar,Vedang Talekar,Aparna Santra Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交叉注意力的CAST模型，用于更有效地融合时空特征，提升深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限性。

Method: 通过交叉注意力机制动态融合时空特征，增强对时间演化伪影的检测能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%，跨数据集测试AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

### [5] [Elucidating and Endowing the Diffusion Training Paradigm for General Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21722)
*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像恢复框架，通过将扩散训练范式融入普通图像恢复网络，优化了单任务和多任务统一图像恢复的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像恢复任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但其复杂架构和迭代过程限制了实际应用。现有方法主要关注网络架构和扩散路径优化，忽略了扩散训练范式在普通图像恢复框架中的整合。

Method: 通过系统分析时间步依赖、网络层次、噪声级别关系和多任务相关性，提出了一种基于扩散训练的新框架，并引入正则化策略和对齐扩散目标与图像恢复任务的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了单任务图像恢复网络的泛化能力，并在多任务统一图像恢复中表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可以无缝集成到现有的普通图像恢复架构中，为图像恢复任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

### [6] [Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation for 3D Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21724)
*Remco F. Leijenaar,Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsymDSD是一种自监督学习框架，通过潜在空间预测结合掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏大规模标注数据集的情况下，如何从无结构3D点云中学习有意义的语义表示是一个挑战。现有的掩码点建模（MPM）方法因基于重建的目标而难以捕捉高级语义。

Method: 提出AsymDSD框架，采用联合嵌入架构，引入非对称设置、屏蔽掩码查询间的注意力、多掩码采样和多裁剪等技术。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN上达到90.53%的准确率，预训练后提升至93.72%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过潜在空间预测有效结合了掩码建模和不变性学习，显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [7] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个理论框架MESP和LCH，探讨概率生成模型的局限性，即学习全局分布导致记忆而非生成行为。MESP源于对VAE的重新思考，提出基于重叠系数的下界，并设计了BL-AE和ARVM模型。LCH假设生成能力源于局部相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索概率生成模型因学习全局分布而导致的记忆问题，提出新的理论框架以区分记忆与生成行为。

Method: 提出MESP框架，设计BL-AE和ARVM模型；提出LCH假设，验证局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但发现其反映记忆而非生成行为。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH为理解生成模型的局限性提供了新视角，局部相关性可能是生成能力的关键。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedNCA是一种专为医疗图像分割设计的轻量级联邦学习系统，适用于资源有限的地区，解决了计算资源和网络连接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低收入和中等收入国家（LMICs），医疗资源有限，联邦学习（FL）可以协作训练模型而不共享敏感数据，但面临计算资源和网络连接障碍。

Method: FedNCA采用轻量级Med-NCA架构，支持低成本边缘设备（如智能手机）训练，并减少通信成本，同时具备加密能力以适应不稳定网络。

Result: FedNCA成功克服了基础设施和安全挑战，为资源受限地区提供了高效、轻量级且支持加密的医疗成像解决方案。

Conclusion: FedNCA为资源受限地区实现公平医疗进步提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

*Sirnam Swetha,Rohit Gupta,Parth Parag Kulkarni,David G Shatwell,Jeffrey A Chan Santiago,Nyle Siddiqui,Joseph Fioresi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImplicitQA是一个新的视频问答基准，专注于测试模型在隐含推理上的能力，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显性视觉内容，而忽略了隐含推理能力，这是人类理解叙事内容的关键。

Method: 构建了包含1K QA对的ImplicitQA基准，涵盖多种推理维度，如空间、因果、社交等。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在隐含推理任务上表现不佳，依赖表面视觉线索。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA旨在推动社区在隐含推理方向的研究，并公开了数据集和框架。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Result: 实验表明，最小预处理比复杂增强方法具有更高的AUC-ROC，模型在未见数据集上表现出强判别性能。

Conclusion: 该流程为青光眼早期检测提供了可重复且可扩展的方法，具有潜在临床实用性。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Motivation: 探索计算机视觉技术在自我中心视频中的应用，评估不同范式在视频摘要任务中的有效性，推动该领域的发展。

Method: 评估了三种模型：Shotluck Holmes（监督学习）、TAC-SUM（无监督学习）和GPT-4o（提示微调），使用Ego-Exo4D数据集的小子集进行实验。

Result: 当前最先进模型在第一人称视频中表现较差，而GPT-4o表现更优，突显了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以提升自我中心视频的处理能力，提示微调模型展示了潜力，但仍需更多资源支持。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注手术分析的孤立方面（如工具检测或阶段分割），缺乏对实体间语义关系的全面表示。

Method: 通过引入CAT-SG数据集，提供工具-组织交互、程序变化和时间依赖的结构化标注，并提出CatSGG模型生成结构化手术表示。

Result: CatSGG模型在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的手术培训、实时决策支持和流程分析提供了更智能、上下文感知的系统基础。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少人工标注需求，推动了历史地图的自动化处理与分析。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将用户视为被动消费者，缺乏个性化，影响参与度和沉浸感。

Method: 系统包含故事生成、个性化图像生成和背景生成三个模块，结合用户面部和提示生成内容。

Result: 用户研究表明，系统提升了参与感和归属感，但需要更精细的叙事编辑工具。

Conclusion: TaleForge通过个性化文本和图像对齐，推动了多模态故事叙述的发展。

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrefPaint通过引入人类反馈改进Stable Diffusion Inpainting，在医学图像修复中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像修复的准确性至关重要，现有模型可能生成不准确图像，影响诊断。

Method: PrefPaint结合人类反馈，无需昂贵奖励模型，并提供基于Web的交互界面。

Result: PrefPaint在医学领域生成更真实的息肉图像，减少视觉不一致性。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面提升了医学图像修复的可靠性和效果。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for

### [16] [ProSAM: Enhancing the Robustness of SAM-based Visual Reference Segmentation with Probabilistic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21835)
*Xiaoqi Wang,Clint Sebastian,Wenbin He,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器生成更稳定的提示，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示导致的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想，常在物体边界生成提示，导致不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM通过学习变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，ProSAM表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制，通过混合训练策略和变分分数蒸馏，成功从EEG数据生成3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将脑电活动转换为2D图像，忽略了EEG数据中丰富的3D空间信息，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Method: 采用双重自注意力机制的EEG编码器，结合交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习的混合训练策略，并利用稳定扩散和变分分数蒸馏训练神经辐射场。

Result: 成功从EEG数据生成了内容和结构相似的3D物体。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统2D重建的限制，为BCI和通信障碍辅助提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种RGB-IR图像对的联合压缩框架，通过跨模态熵模型（CCEM）提升压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据（如RGB-IR）应用的增加，存储和传输成本成倍增长，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了通道级跨模态熵模型（CCEM），包括低频上下文提取块（LCEB）和融合块（LCFB），以利用跨模态先验信息进行精确的概率建模。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP数据集上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

Motivation: 捕捉面部视频中皮肤色调的细微变化以估计生理信号（如心率）是rPPG的关键挑战。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器学习高维时空表示，结合帧掩码和生理带宽限制约束。

Result: 在多个数据集（PURE、UBFC-rPPG、MMPD、V4V）上表现出显著性能提升，尤其在跨数据集评估中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习和生理约束有效提升了rPPG任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前多模态方法在整合全切片图像（WSIs）与空间转录组学（ST）数据方面存在不足，而这对捕捉分子异质性至关重要。

Method: SPADE采用混合数据专家技术，通过两阶段特征空间聚类和对比学习，学习共配准的WSI块和基因表达谱的表示。

Result: 在14个下游任务中，SPADE表现出显著优于基线模型的少样本性能。

Conclusion: SPADE展示了将形态学和分子信息整合到单一潜在空间的优势。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的token压缩策略，用于视频多模态大语言模型，通过语义连通组件（SCC）实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于注意力分数压缩token，但无法全面捕捉语义区域且易导致冗余。

Method: 提出两步骤时空token压缩策略，利用SCC在空间和时间域分配token，确保语义覆盖。

Result: 在多种视频理解任务中表现优异，尤其在低token保留率下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor通过SCC实现了高效的token压缩，提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感（RS）图像理解的新型大型视觉与语言模型（LVLM）框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，显著提升了遥感场景的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉与语言模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但由于遥感图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上的显著差异，直接应用于遥感场景效果不佳。因此，需要一种专门针对遥感图像理解的模型框架。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）语义增强的多级对齐模块，通过检索遥感语义知识库中的相关语义线索，将多级视觉特征与语义信息融合；2）语义感知专家建模，设计多个语义专家分别处理不同层次的语义表示，实现从粗到细的层次化语义理解。

Result: 在多个遥感任务（如场景分类和视觉问答等）上的评估表明，该框架在不同语义级别上均取得了显著改进，有效弥合了通用LVLM与遥感特定需求之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架通过语义增强和层次化建模，显著提升了遥感图像的理解能力，为遥感领域的视觉与语言任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Motivation: 现有模型主要基于卷积或Transformer特征，各有优势但存在特征异质性、高复杂性和大参数等问题，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 设计了全局-局部混合注意力机制，通过双视角捕获信息，并引入傅里叶空间合并策略；提出门控线性前馈网络增强表达能力；构建DPU-Former解码器聚合多层特征。

Result: DPU-Former在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过融合长程依赖和空间细节，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现优异，但token剪枝会显著降低其定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过调整位置ID来恢复剪枝后的性能。

Result: GAP将LLaVA在RefCOCO验证集上的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP方法无需额外训练或计算开销，适用于多种模型和剪枝策略，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了远程评估的自动化评分鲁棒性，减少了人工标注的需求。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Conclusion: SODA是一种高效的推理方法，显著提升了点云OOD检测的性能，解决了合成到真实域偏移的挑战。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在细粒度视觉分类任务中有效解决了标记数据稀缺的问题，并展示了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fine Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) remains a challenging task in
computer vision due to subtle inter class differences and fragile feature
representations. Existing methods struggle in fine grained scenarios,
especially when labeled data is scarce. We propose a semi supervised method
combining Mamba based feature modeling, region attention, and Bayesian
uncertainty. Our approach enhances local to global feature modeling while
focusing on key areas during learning. Bayesian inference selects high quality
pseudo labels for stability. Experiments show strong performance on FGVC
benchmarks with occlusions, demonstrating robustness when labeled data is
limited. Code is available at https://github.com/wxqnl/RAUM Net.

Result: 模型能够生成与用户文本和属性输入一致的、真实且属性感知的动作。

Conclusion: 通过引入HumanAttr数据集和实验验证，证明了模型在属性感知文本到动作生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SepFormer通过单步分隔回归和粗到细优化，显著提升了表格结构识别的效率和效果。

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been
made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/ZeroReg3D

Motivation: 现有方法在3D视觉定位中过于依赖3D训练数据或仅关注单一模态（空间或语义），限制了实际应用效果。

Method: SPAZER通过渐进式推理框架，结合3D渲染和2D图像，进行锚点引导的候选筛选和3D-2D联合决策。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中，SPAZER比现有零样本方法准确率分别提升9.0%和10.9%。

Conclusion: SPAZER通过融合空间和语义推理，实现了无需3D标注数据的鲁棒零样本定位。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割面临类别差异、遮挡和对象尺寸变化的挑战，现有深度卷积神经网络（DCNNs）难以提取足够特征。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet性能优于当前DCNNs。

Conclusion: SDRNet通过多上下文特征学习和全局-局部上下文利用，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割效果。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 提出的语义掩码自动编码器显著提升了点云理解的语义捕捉能力和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

TL;DR: TASeg是一个文本感知的RGB-T分割框架，通过LoRA微调技术改进视觉基础模型，解决了现有方法在视觉特征相似类别上的分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T语义分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，导致在视觉特征相似类别上分割不准确；SAM在实例级分割表现优秀，但与热图像和文本的集成存在模态异质性和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出TASeg框架，采用LoRA微调技术，在图像编码器中引入动态特征融合模块（DFFM）融合多模态视觉特征，并在掩码解码器中加入CLIP生成的文本嵌入以实现语义对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TASeg在挑战性场景中表现优异，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TASeg通过结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升了RGB-T语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准测试中表现优异，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪任务中的潜力，并讨论了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题。现有基于扭矩正则化的剪枝方法效果不佳，剪枝后网络仍较密集且精度下降明显。

Method: 作者提出指数扭矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案对神经网络模块进行正则化，以更有效地剪枝冗余和远距离模块，同时保留必要模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，ETP在多个领域实现了比现有剪枝策略更高的压缩率，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单但高效的剪枝方法，显著提升了模型压缩效果。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Conclusion: HOSS ReID和TransOSS为全天候船舶跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Motivation: 解决零样本语义分割中视觉-语言对齐和CLIP全局表示与分割模型局部特征之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg结合分割主干和CLIP语义头，以及选择性全局蒸馏（SGD）和语义对齐模块（SAM）。

Result: 在两个基准测试中hIoU分别提升了0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了ZSS中的关键挑战，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Motivation: 现有基于重建和渲染的说话头合成方法依赖身份特定模型，计算成本高且扩展性差。FIAG旨在克服这些限制。

Conclusion: FIAG通过共享结构和运动先验，显著提升了身份适应的效率和效果。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过直线约束和半自动设计，简化了交互并保持了临床相关性，显著提升了左心室测量的准确性。

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Result: 在EMTD Benchmark上，MirrorMe在保真度、唇同步准确性和时间稳定性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计和高效模型，实现了高质量的实时音频驱动肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Method: 通过滚动快门相机中单条扫描线的线投影交点估计相对位姿，支持单视图或多视图场景，并开发了最小求解器处理平行线和已知重力方向的情况。

Result: 在Fastec数据集上的实验验证了该方法在滚动快门SfM初始化中的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为滚动快门SfM提供了无需运动模型的位姿估计基础模块，具有进一步开发的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 人类推理能力强大，而机器智能仍受限于训练数据，无法在推理时动态优化解决方案。现有研究多集中于语言领域，非语言推理（如视觉感知、空间推理等）仍具挑战性。

Method: 受心理学双系统理论启发，结合快速思考的System I模块（熟悉任务）和慢速思考的System II模块（通过自玩强化学习迭代优化解决方案）。

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理展示了变革性潜力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法在超短视频中心率测量上达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Result: TPM显著提高了分割精度，并支持多类分割。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Result: 在多维数据恢复任务（如图像修复、去噪和点云上采样）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CP-INR方法在连续数据表示中兼具可解释性和性能优势。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Q-Frame通过自适应帧选择和多分辨率缩放，显著提升了视频理解任务的性能，同时不超出计算限制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCT基础模型仅依赖图像数据，缺乏语义理解能力，需监督微调，但成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出RetFiner，利用文本数据的丰富监督信号，设计多样化训练目标优化模型表示。

Result: 在RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM模型上，线性探测性能平均提升5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner显著提升基础模型在下游任务中的性能，无需额外监督微调。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Motivation: 现有少样本目标检测方法在共享特征空间中耦合了目标识别和前景分类，导致类特定的目标性标准和样本不足问题。

Method: UOFS将特征空间解耦为幅度和角度两部分，分别编码目标性和分类；采用混合背景优化（HBO）策略处理未标记实例；引入空间注意力解耦与关联（SADA）模块解决任务冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于耦合特征空间的方法。

Conclusion: 通过解耦特征空间和优化策略，UOFS有效解决了少样本目标检测中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频率分解的骨架语义表示学习方法（FS-VAE），通过高频和低频调整增强骨架语义学习，并结合多级对齐的语义描述，提升了零样本动作识别的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注视觉和语义表示的对齐，但忽略了语义空间中细粒度动作模式的重要性（如喝水与刷牙的手部动作）。

Method: FS-VAE包含三个关键组件：1）基于频率的增强模块；2）多级对齐的语义描述；3）校准的交叉对齐损失。

Result: 实验表明，频率增强的语义特征能有效区分视觉和语义相似的动作簇，提升了零样本动作识别的性能。

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率分解和多级语义对齐，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE在个性化低光图像增强中表现出色，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合4D信息和优化帧采样策略，有效提升了机器人数据预训练的性能和效率。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Conclusion: EAMamba有效解决了Vision Mamba的局限性，为图像恢复任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Motivation: 自然场景为对象识别和引用提供了丰富的上下文，研究旨在验证VLMs是否类似地依赖场景上下文。

Method: 通过COOCO数据集测试VLMs在不同场景-对象一致性和噪声下的表现，并进行注意力分析。

Result: 模型会根据场景-对象语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖，成功分类时中层注意力更集中于目标对象。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息，尤其在目标-场景高一致性或对象退化时更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，VisionDrop在无需额外训练或复杂修改的情况下，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisionDrop通过简单有效的设计，实现了高效推理并保持了跨任务的强性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段管道和约束驱动优化，有效解决了多约束场景下的3D室内场景生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 实验表明，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新设计和损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘的质量和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Motivation: 模糊保险库模板保护中的性能下降主要由不稳定的纠错能力和特征类型转换引起的信息丢失导致。

Method: 提出了一种基于等频区间的特征量化方法，确保固定特征集大小，并支持无训练适应任意区间数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了性能差距，且在主流生物识别模态（如人脸、指纹、虹膜）上效果显著。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了性能下降问题，并与现有系统无缝集成，仅保留最小性能损失。

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Conclusion: ViT B16在噪声环境下更具优势，方法可推广至无人机等航空任务。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a

critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image
data, extending these to 3D environments involves unique obstacles. This paper
introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMMs在抽象和自适应推理方面表现不足，无法根据新信息动态调整解释。DVidE任务模拟现实场景，要求模型根据新证据更新推理。

Method: 分类任务采用Chain of Counterfactual Thought框架，结合反事实推理和ASR增强视频内容；生成任务结合ASR输出和LLM生成连贯更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法显著提升了VLMMs的动态推理能力。

Conclusion: DVidE任务及配套方法有效解决了VLMMs的动态推理问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在语义等效输入下表现不一致，影响可靠性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出测试时一致性框架，包括交叉熵一致性损失和伪标签一致性损失。

Result: 在MM-R3基准测试中显著提升模型一致性。

Conclusion: 为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Result: 支持多种精确且物理一致的操作（如姿态编辑、旋转、纹理修改等），实验证明了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion为高质量、可控的视频编辑工作流程迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化辐射场的不确定性是一个重要但未被充分解决的问题，现有方法通常需要训练或针对特定框架。

Method: 利用反向变形将可靠渲染投影到新视角，并测量其与渲染图像的一致性。

Result: WarpRF在不确定性量化和下游任务（如主动视图选择和主动映射）中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: WarpRF是一种简单、低成本且通用的解决方案，适用于任何辐射场实现。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖人工标注的情况下，显著提升了多图像推理能力，并在通用视觉任务上表现出色。

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

Motivation: 超表面的逆向设计由于结构与光学特性之间的复杂非线性关系而具有挑战性，通常需要专家调整且计算成本高。

Conclusion: 论文展示了扩散模型在超表面设计中的潜力，并公开了代码和数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali为多向量文档检索提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

Conclusion: 检索增强与代理多步推理的结合为自动化布局生成提供了可扩展、可解释且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，而强化学习（RL）的应用又容易导致性能下降和过度思考问题。

Method: 提出了非对称策略优化（APO），包括针对正样本的DADS和针对负样本的STCR，动态调整KL惩罚和抑制过度思考。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上实现的View-R1-3B模型在推理任务中平均提升7%，且优于更大的MLLMs（7-11B），同时保持了通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: CitySim是一种生成式城市交通模拟器，旨在通过模拟技术扩展手动驾驶里程，实现从A点到B点的无缝模拟。SceneDiffuser++是首个端到端生成世界模型，整合了多种技术需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交通模拟中手动驾驶里程有限的问题，并整合多种模拟技术以实现城市规模的A点到B点模拟。

Method: 提出SceneDiffuser++，一种基于单一损失函数的端到端生成世界模型，整合了场景生成、代理行为建模、遮挡推理、动态场景生成和环境模拟等技术。

Result: 在扩展版的Waymo Open Motion Dataset上验证了SceneDiffuser++的城市规模交通模拟能力，展示了其在长时间模拟条件下的优越真实性。

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++为城市规模交通模拟提供了一种高效且真实的解决方案，填补了动态场景生成和环境模拟等领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

### [90] [Unfolding Generative Flows with Koopman Operators: Fast and Interpretable Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22304)
*Erkan Turan,Aristotelis Siozopoulos,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Koopman-enhanced Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) accelerates sampling and improves interpretability by modeling non-linear flows as linear dynamics in a learned space, enabling one-step sampling and structured analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFM relies on computationally expensive non-linear ODEs for sampling, lacking interpretability. This work aims to speed up CFM while providing insights into the generative process.

Method: Integrates Koopman operator theory to linearize generative dynamics in a learned space, enabling closed-form sampling via matrix exponentiation. Uses a decoder-free architecture.

Result: Achieves significant speedups on 2D datasets and benchmarks (MNIST, F-MNIST, TFD). The Koopman generator's spectral properties offer tools for analyzing generative behavior.

Conclusion: Koopman-enhanced CFM combines fast sampling with interpretability, advancing generative modeling by providing structured insights into the dynamics.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Motivation: 现有数据集和模型主要针对城市环境或宽阔的越野路径，无法满足狭窄、类似小径的越野场景的需求，尤其是在搜索救援和森林火灾等关键应用中。

Method: 通过高保真多模态传感器数据（包括128通道LiDAR、立体图像、GNSS、IMU和光照测量）构建TOMD数据集，并提出动态多尺度数据融合模型。

Conclusion: TOMD数据集和动态多尺度数据融合模型为越野导航研究提供了重要支持，未来研究可通过公开数据集进一步探索。

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Result: 系统AWD为0.7秒，偏差检测准确率达98.6%。

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升了无人机着陆的可靠性，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Conclusion: 该方法为滑移转向车辆的视觉导航提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.
Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and

Result: 展示了QuKAN架构的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN架构为量子机器学习提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Conclusion: PhotonSplat框架有效解决了运动模糊和噪声问题，扩展了神经渲染的应用场景。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over
long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024
Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless
3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the
first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge
attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at

Result: 实验证明方法具有优越性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合物理模型和深度学习有效提升了IHI重建质量。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为机器人、增强现实等应用提供了更准确的材料感知和编辑能力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的图像压缩方法在超低比特率下需要大量去噪步骤，且难以保证像素级一致性，限制了实时应用。

Method: 提出Deep Compression Latent Codec和Dual-Branch Coding Structure，结合端到端优化，实现高效压缩和高保真重建。

Result: 在CLIC 2020、DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，StableCodec在FID、KID和DISTS指标上显著优于现有方法，比特率低至0.005 bpp。

Conclusion: StableCodec在超低比特率下实现了高真实感和高保真，且推理速度与主流变换编码方案相当。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

### [104] [Noise-Inspired Diffusion Model for Generalizable Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22012)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在低剂量CT重建中因噪声分布偏离高斯分布和先验信息不准确导致的非真实结构问题。

Method: 结合移位泊松扩散模型和双重引导扩散模型，分别处理投影数据和重建图像，通过时间步匹配策略适应不同剂量水平。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，NEED在重建和泛化性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEED仅需正常剂量数据训练，即可有效扩展到未见过的剂量水平，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

### [105] [Towards Scalable and Robust White Matter Lesion Localization via Multimodal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22041)
*Julia Machnio,Sebastian Nørgaard Llambias,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习框架，用于白质高信号（WMH）的分割和定位，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，并评估了不同输入配置的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理缺失模态和整合解剖定位方面缺乏灵活性，因此需要一种更灵活且高效的方法来准确分割和定位WMH。

Method: 提出了一种深度学习框架，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，并引入多任务模型联合预测病变和解剖区域掩模。

Result: 多模态输入显著提高了分割性能，而模态可互换设置牺牲了准确性以换取鲁棒性。多任务学习在联合分割中效果不如单独模型。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析的准确性和鲁棒性具有重要价值，联合建模在集成预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

*Ajay Mittal,Raghav Mehta,Omar Todd,Philipp Seeböck,Georg Langs,Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分割、配准和分类的三阶段心血管疾病（CVD）分类方法，提高了分类准确性和临床可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法直接处理原始CT数据或结合分割结果，临床可解释性差。本文旨在通过分阶段方法提升分类准确性和可解释性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：图像分割、图像配准和CVD分类。利用Atlas-ISTN框架和分割基础模型生成解剖结构分割和健康图谱，提取放射组学特征和几何特征进行分类。

Result: 在ASOCA数据集上，该方法分类准确率达87.50%，显著高于直接使用原始CT数据的模型（67.50%）。

Conclusion: 分阶段方法结合临床可解释特征显著提升了CVD分类性能，为临床决策提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

*Yuliang Huang,Imraj Singh,Thomas Joyce,Kris Thielemans,Jamie R. McClelland*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自由变形（FFD）的空间基函数和变形感知框架，用于动态CBCT重建，显著提升了图像质量并加快了计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态CBCT在放疗中因呼吸运动产生伪影，现有方法如相位分类重建无法处理呼吸变异性，而4D高斯泼溅（4DGS）方法计算成本高或缺乏空间正则化。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，通过统一变形场耦合高斯均值位置、尺度和旋转的时间演化，确保运动一致性。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS为高效、运动补偿的CBCT重建提供了潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

*Anirban Ray,Ashesh,Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching是一种新型的迭代方法，用于去雾光显微镜图像，平衡了数据保真度和感知真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在去雾显微镜图像时无法同时兼顾数据保真度和感知真实性的问题。

Method: 基于条件流匹配框架，通过条件速度场引导生成过程，无需显式退化算子。

Result: 在5个数据集上评估，HazeMatching在保真度和真实性之间取得了平衡，且预测结果校准良好。

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种高效且易于应用的方法，适用于真实显微镜数据。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 单次曝光HDR成像技术通过随机光学排列和GRR快门模式解决传统多曝光方法的运动伪影问题，并在高饱和度区域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR成像依赖多曝光，导致动态场景中出现运动伪影；单次曝光方法虽能缓解此问题，但在高光区域表现不佳。

Method: 利用GRR快门模式和随机光学排列技术，通过优化问题和简单总变分先验恢复HDR数据。

Result: 仿真显示该方法在高饱和度（10%以上）时优于其他单次曝光方法，原型机动态范围达73dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了单次曝光HDR成像在高光区域的挑战，并展示了实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

*Hyundong Cho,Spencer Lin,Tejas Srinivasan,Michael Saxon,Deuksin Kwon,Natali T. Chavez,Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类，呼吁加强研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作作为非语言沟通的子集，因其明确性和低解释方差，是理解更复杂非语言沟通的关键前提。

Method: 提出MIME基准测试，包含86种哑剧动作的视频问答任务，通过运动捕捉数据构建，并加入扰动以评估鲁棒性。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME测试中表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需加强研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在效率和准确性之间的权衡问题，以及梯度消失和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于百万参数模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的沟通工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法来提升其可解释性。

Method: 通过分类（编码器-解码器、仅编码器、仅解码器）综述XAI方法，并分析其评估和应用。

Result: 总结了现有XAI技术的优缺点，并提供了评估框架和实际应用案例。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究透明和负责任的LLMs，以解决当前挑战并推动XAI发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段框架（感知与预测），并引入WM-ABench基准，涵盖23个细粒度评估维度。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，例如运动轨迹区分接近随机准确率。

Conclusion: VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.
