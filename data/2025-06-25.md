### [1] [Correspondence-Free Multiview Point Cloud Registration via Depth-Guided Joint Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18922)
*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特征提取和数据关联，难以在复杂环境中获得全局最优解。

Method: 将全局地图表示为深度图，利用原始深度信息构建非线性最小二乘优化问题，联合估计点云位姿和全局地图。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，该方法在精度上优于现有方法，尤其在特征提取和数据关联困难的复杂环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式数据关联和动态优化，有效解决了复杂环境中的多视角点云配准问题。

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

*Ammar K Al Mhdawi,Nonso Nnamoko,Safanah Mudheher Raafat,M. K. S. Al-Mhdawi,Amjad J Humaidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLOv8的实时车辆检测与分类框架，用于估算城市环境中的碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有YOLOv8缺乏细粒度识别能力（如车牌识别或车辆属性分类），需要结合OCR技术实现精准碳排放估算。

Method: 采用混合管道，结合YOLOv8检测、分割与跟踪，再通过深度OCR模块识别车牌，并调用API验证车辆信息。

Result: YOLOv8检测mAP@0.5达71%，分割达70%；OCR字符级准确率最高99%。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能交通系统提供了可扩展的车辆碳排放监测解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

### [3] [Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18925)
*Tahereh Zarrat Ehsan,Michael Tangermann,Yağmur Güçlütürk,Bastiaan R. Bloem,Luc J. W. Evers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于计算机视觉的细粒度方法，用于从视频记录中量化帕金森病（PD）的运动特征，提高了MDS-UPDRS评分预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手指敲击测试依赖于主观评估，存在评分者间和评分者内变异性，且无法捕捉个体运动特征。本文旨在通过客观的计算机视觉方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了四组临床相关特征来表征运动障碍（如运动减少、运动迟缓、序列效应和犹豫停顿），并通过主成分分析和机器学习分类器进行评分预测。

Result: 视频分析不仅与四种运动缺陷对应，还进一步细分了序列效应和犹豫停顿。该方法在MDS-UPDRS评分预测中优于现有方法，同时提供了可解释的运动特征量化。

Conclusion: 该框架为PD运动特征的客观评估提供了实用解决方案，适用于临床和远程场景。未来需进一步验证其对症状治疗和疾病进展的响应性。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Grouping for Tubular Structure Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18930)
*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的段级跟踪方法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有段级方法计算效率低且依赖先验知识，难以处理复杂形态和环境变化。

Method: 将段级跟踪建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用Q-Learning动态探索段图，自适应计算边权重。

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上显著优于现有方法，能处理复杂拓扑且不依赖先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、鲁棒，适用于复杂形态的管状结构跟踪。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

### [5] [Bird's-eye view safety monitoring for the construction top under the tower crane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18938)
*Yanke Wang,Yu Hin Ng,Haobo Liang,Ching-Wei Chang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的全自动塔吊安全监控系统，通过摄像头和LiDAR融合3D数据，保护工人并避免碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 塔吊操作日益自动化，但安全保护仍需改进，尤其是工人和塔吊之间的碰撞风险。

Method: 结合摄像头和LiDAR的3D数据融合，开发软件管道与硬件和显示系统集成。

Result: 系统在真实工地验证了准确性和有效性，可作为安全监控工具。

Conclusion: 该系统为塔吊操作提供了高效的安全监控解决方案。

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

### [6] [Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939)
*Rui An,Yifeng Zhang,Ziran Liang,Wenqi Fan,Yuxuan Liang,Xuequn Shang,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Damba-ST是一种基于Mamba的高效城市时空预测模型，通过域自适应状态空间模型和域适配器提升跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的模型存在计算复杂度和内存开销高的问题，限制了其扩展性和实际部署。

Method: 提出Damba-ST，结合域自适应状态空间模型和三种域适配器，以学习跨域共性和域内特征。

Result: Damba-ST在预测任务中表现优异，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Damba-ST在保持线性复杂度的同时，显著提升了跨域适应性，适用于新城市环境的无缝部署。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [From Pixels and Words to Waves: A Unified Framework for Spectral Dictionary vLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18943)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDict-VLM是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过频谱字典标记混合器替代卷积和自注意力，实现了高效且可解释的多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖计算密集的卷积和自注意力机制，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 引入频谱字典标记混合器，将图像块或词片表示为可学习频率原子的稀疏组合。

Result: 在MS-COCO和VQAv2任务上表现优异，性能接近BLIP-2但参数更少、速度更快。

Conclusion: SDict-VLM为高效且可解释的视觉语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRIS利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，通过上下文感知适配器和渐进式跨模态推理解码器，提升了遥感图像分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中因尺度变化、方向多样和语义模糊带来的挑战。

Method: 引入CP-adapter动态优化语言特征，PCMRD迭代对齐文本与视觉区域。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DiffRIS验证了预训练扩散模型在遥感应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

### [9] [GLIMPSE: Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation for Generative LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18985)
*Guanxi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于可视化大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在开放视觉问答（VQA）中依赖的显著图像区域，同时揭示多模态文本显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LVLM在生成自由形式文本响应时的视觉注意力分布对模型行为理解、幻觉诊断、偏见暴露和透明度至关重要。

Method: GLIMPSE结合梯度加权注意力、自适应层传播和加权令牌聚合，生成响应级归因热图，用于解释跨模态推理。

Result: GLIMPSE在人类对齐方面优于先前的可解释性方法，并能揭示LVLM的跨模态归因、令牌级推理动态以及人类注意力错位、幻觉和偏见。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为分析LVLM的跨模态推理提供了细粒度洞察，有助于提升模型透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

*Yuan Yao,Yicong Hong,Difan Liu,Long Mai,Feng Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种扩散Transformer到Mamba的蒸馏方法（T2MD），以解决高分辨率图像生成中自注意力计算复杂度高的问题，同时保持全局依赖性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力在扩散Transformer中的二次计算复杂度导致高分辨率图像生成的计算成本高昂，而直接训练Mamba模型存在挑战。

Method: 通过层级的教师强制和基于特征的知识蒸馏，T2MD建立了一个混合模型，结合了自注意力和Mamba的优势。

Result: 实验表明，T2MD在512×512分辨率基础上，通过轻量级适应和高分辨率微调，成功生成2048×2048的高质量图像。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了Mamba模型在非因果视觉输出生成中的可行性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在平衡性能和高效模型适应方面存在困难，尤其是在复杂任务（如语义分割）中。

Method: 使用正交投影子空间保护预训练模型的知识完整性，并通过在线先验知识聚合策略增强模型的领域适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个持续TTA基准测试中超越了现有方法，取得了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: OoPk方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘和错误累积，提升了语义分割任务中的持续适应能力。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music

of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

Conclusion: HAWAII有效整合多专家知识，显著提升性能且计算高效。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Result: 发现模型性能与牙齿可见性相关，且GPT-4o依赖面部特征（如眉毛位置）进行情感推理，表现出高度内部一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基础模型行为的涌现特性，但也指出了在敏感领域（如心理健康和教育）中存在的捷径学习、偏见和公平性问题。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

Conclusion: RareSpot不仅支持关键的生态监测，还为在复杂空中场景中检测小型稀有物种提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像编辑中计算量大，而蒸馏模型因反转质量差导致编辑能力有限，需高保真反转以保持图像结构完整性。

Method: 采用一致性模型和循环一致性优化策略，平衡编辑性与内容保留。

Result: 在多种编辑任务和数据集上达到SOTA性能，效率显著优于全步扩散模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和编辑质量上均优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

TL;DR: PrITTI是一种基于潜在扩散的框架，利用基元生成可控、可编辑的3D语义场景布局，优于体素基线且内存需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体素表示内存密集、分辨率固定和难以编辑的问题，基元更适合生成可控的3D场景。

Method: 采用混合表示，地面用栅格化格式，对象用向量化3D基元，并引入稳定的Cholesky参数化编码对象大小和方向。

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上，PrITTI生成质量优于体素基线，内存需求降低3倍，支持实例级操作和多种下游应用。

Conclusion: PrITTI展示了基元在3D场景生成中的优势，提供了高效、可控和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MobileViT的轻量级RGB-T跟踪算法，通过渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力实现高效多模态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态跟踪在低光照和恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，多模态跟踪（如RGB-T）利用互补数据提升性能，但现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 采用MobileViT构建轻量级模型，引入渐进式融合框架和可分离注意力学习模态内和模态间交互。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122 FPS，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT用于RGB-T跟踪，实现了高效、轻量的多模态跟踪，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频在政治话语和网络社会威胁（如错误信息、宣传和激进化）中扮演重要角色，检测视频中的“突出”时刻对内容审核、摘要和法医分析至关重要。

Method: PRISM在CIELAB色彩空间中运行，使用感知色差度量来识别与人类视觉敏感度一致的帧，无需训练且计算高效。

Result: 在BBC、TVSum、SumMe和ClipShots四个基准数据集上评估，PRISM表现出高准确性和保真度，同时保持高压缩比。

Conclusion: PRISM在结构化和非结构化视频内容中均有效，具有作为分析和审核有害或政治敏感媒体的可扩展工具的潜力。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Motivation: 心血管事件是全球主要死因，现有筛查方法存在采样偏差和单模态限制，需要更全面的风险评估方法。

Method: 提出MOSCARD框架，结合多模态对齐、因果推理和双反向传播图技术，整合CXR和ECG数据。

Result: 在内部和外部数据集上，模型AUC分别为0.75、0.83和0.71，优于单模态和现有基础模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为成本效益高的筛查提供了早期干预机会，改善了患者预后并减少了差异。

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

Conclusion: OW 是一个灵活且经济高效的全球生物多样性评估解决方案，代码和数据集已公开以支持可重复性。

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识，因此需要开发更可靠的MLLMs以减少诊断错误。

Method: 通过VQA框架设计MedErr-CT基准，包含六类错误和三个任务级别（分类、检测和纠正）。

Result: 评估显示，不同MLLMs在不同错误类型上的能力存在显著差异。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高临床准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Result: Video-XL-2在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，并能高效处理超长视频。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新的稀疏化技术，成功解决了长视频理解中的性能和效率挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

Conclusion: MSR-Align为提升推理能力强的视觉语言模型的安全对齐提供了可扩展且有效的基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image

empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中因无法有效捕捉图像通道间的长距离依赖而限制了特征表示能力。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 3D-SSM及其相关模块显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能，尤其在捕捉全局信息和细微变化方面表现突出。

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN方法在无监督域适应任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The
dataset and development kits are open-sourced at

TL;DR: 论文提出首个针对水道环境的图像描述数据集WaterCaption，并提出边缘可部署的多模态大语言模型Da Yu，通过Nano Transformer Adaptor提升长文本生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水道感知模型缺乏全局语义理解能力，限制了大规模监测和结构化日志生成。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）构建WaterCaption数据集，并提出Da Yu模型及其NTA模块。

Result: Da Yu在WaterCaption和其他基准测试中表现优异，平衡了性能与效率。

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境的视觉地理理解和空间场景认知提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

TL;DR: HoliGS是一种新颖的可变形高斯泼溅框架，用于从长单目RGB视频中进行实体视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有4D高斯泼溅和动态NeRF方法在长时间捕捉中训练开销大的问题。

Method: 通过可逆高斯泼溅变形网络，将场景分解为静态背景和时间变化对象，利用分层变形策略实现自由视点渲染。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上实现高质量重建，同时显著减少训练和渲染时间。

Conclusion: HoliGS为现实场景中的实体视图合成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VLM引导的级联框架，用于开放词汇伪装目标分割（OVCOS），显著提升了分割和分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在伪装目标分割中因领域差距和通用分割模型局限性导致的分割不精确和分类不准确问题。

Method: 利用VLM引导的SAM进行分割，并通过alpha通道保留图像上下文进行软空间先验分类。

Result: 在OVCOS和传统伪装目标分割基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过共享VLM语义，实现了高效且语义一致的分割和分类，为伪装目标处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Result: 模型在预测准确性、敏感性和可信度上均有提升，适用于高压力环境。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床技能评估提供了更客观的工具，有望改善紧急医学的培训和患者结果。

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D点云与文本的细粒度对齐上表现不佳，主要依赖简单的余弦相似度，缺乏表达能力。

Method: 提出LM-AD方法，结合预训练语言模型，通过AQM模块高效捕捉点云与文本的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在3D AffordanceNet数据集上，LM-AD在准确率和平均交并比上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LM-AD通过AQM模块显著提升了3D点云功能检测的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Motivation: 解决多模态域适应问题，特别是在目标域中某些模态缺失的情况下，如何有效利用源域的多模态数据。

Method: 通过渐进式模态合作（PMC）选择可靠的伪标记目标样本，并提出了PMC-PI方法，利用多模态数据生成（MMG）网络生成目标域缺失的模态。

Result: 在三个图像数据集和八个视频数据集上的实验验证了PMC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态跨域视觉识别任务中表现出色，尤其在处理模态缺失问题时具有优势。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Conclusion: RetCoP成功整合多模态眼底数据，通过持续预训练和抗遗忘策略，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了模态不平衡和不完整模态问题，提升了生存预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Conclusion: Chan-Vese模型适用于复杂分割任务，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.
This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex

Motivation: 蒸馏视频生成模型在无训练设置下难以实现运动定制，现有方法无法适应加速生成过程和大去噪步骤。

Result: 在多种蒸馏视频生成模型和基准数据集上，显著提升运动保真度和生成质量。

Conclusion: MotionEcho在保持高效的同时，有效解决了蒸馏模型的运动定制问题。

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Method: 将组织几何建模为3D点和导数图，变形建模为3D位移和局部变形图。通过相机中心设置优化帧间变形，无需估计相机姿态。

Result: 在非遮挡和遮挡区域的3D重建精度分别为0.37±0.27 mm和0.39±0.21 mm，并能估计表面应变分布。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下稳定建模组织几何和变形，为机械分析提供了额外模态。

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

*Declan J. Curran,Sanaa Hobeichi,Hira Saleem,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDD模型通过分层采样过程显著降低了计算负载，同时保持高精度，适用于多分辨率气候数据降尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降尺度方法计算量大，AI模型（如扩散模型）虽有效但仍计算密集。

Method: 引入分层扩散降尺度（HDD）模型，采用从粗到细的采样策略。

Result: 在ERA5和CMIP6数据集上表现优异，计算负载显著降低。

Conclusion: HDD为概率气候降尺度提供了轻量级解决方案，支持大规模高分辨率气候预测。

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感技术的发展对准确高效的语义分割需求增加，现有方法在计算效率和多尺度特征融合方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出GLCANet，采用双流架构融合全局语义和局部细节，结合自注意力和掩码交叉注意力机制优化特征融合。

Result: 实验表明GLCANet在精度和计算效率上优于现有方法，能高效处理大尺寸高分辨率图像。

Conclusion: GLCANet为实际遥感应用提供了高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件相机的MAV检测方法，利用螺旋桨在事件流中的独特特征，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAV检测方法主要依赖RGB图像中的外观特征，但多样性导致泛化能力不足。事件流中螺旋桨的高频旋转特征具有独特性，可用于检测。

Method: 提出三个模块，分别提取螺旋桨的显著性和时空特征，同时过滤背景噪声和相机运动干扰。

Result: 在未训练的情况下，方法显著优于现有技术，精确率和召回率分别达到83.0%和81.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过事件流特征有效检测MAV，并发布了首个事件相机MAV数据集，为社区提供了新资源。

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Motivation: 解决现有VLN方法在复杂城市环境中缺乏统一记忆和固定上下文窗口限制的问题。

Method: Mem4Nav结合稀疏八叉树和语义拓扑图，通过可逆Transformer嵌入存储，分为长期记忆（LTM）和短期记忆（STM）模块。

Result: 在Touchdown和Map2Seq数据集上，Mem4Nav显著提升了任务完成率（7-13 pp）、SPD和nDTW（>10 pp）。

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块的有效结合，显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Conclusion: AMF-MedIT为医疗多模态分析提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，FT-Mamba在噪声处理和特征提取方面具有优势。

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Motivation: 现有方法通过向图像添加噪声作为样本，但噪声分布可能导致解释确定性低。本文发现额外信息可能使神经网络饱和，因此需要解决样本分布不对齐问题。

Method: 提出了一种半最优采样方法，通过抑制输入特征来生成样本，使样本分布与自然图像分布近似一致。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的广泛定量评估表明，该方法有效且能产生比现有基线更令人满意的解释。

Conclusion: 通过抑制特征而非添加信息，本文方法解决了样本分布不对齐问题，提高了归因分析的确定性。

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Result: KID显示分布差距显著降低；EDM2扩散模型FID降低11%，ViT-S分类模型在ImageNet-100上准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为无法获取大规模真实数据时训练实用模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide

USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and

Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）影响近半数糖尿病患者，需要早期检测。现有自动化方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足的问题。

Method: HMSViT采用基于池化的层次化和双注意力机制，结合绝对位置编码，实现高效多尺度特征提取。设计了块掩码自监督学习框架，减少对标记数据的依赖。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter通过创新方法解决了驾驶场景编辑的关键挑战，展示了强大的编辑能力和高真实性。

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉输入和文本输出之间常出现不一致（视觉幻觉），这在安全关键的人工智能应用中存在风险，需要全面的评估基准和有效的检测方法。

Method: 开发了PRE-HAL数据集，用于评估LVLMs的感知和推理能力；提出了一种基于DST的视觉幻觉检测方法，通过不确定性估计高效捕捉模型推理阶段高级特征的冲突程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在三种LVLMs（LLaVA-v1.5、mPLUG-Owl2和mPLUG-Owl3）上优于五种基线不确定性指标，平均AUROC分别提高了4%、10%和7%。

Conclusion: PRE-HAL数据集和基于DST的检测方法有效提升了LVLMs的可靠性，特别是在关系推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

Result: 模型能够有效重建伪影区域，生成高质量的MVCT样图像，减少重复MVCT扫描的需求。

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS框架为放疗规划提供了高质量的kVCT图像，降低了患者的辐射暴露。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测和识别面部识别系统中自然触发器的后门攻击的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击通过隐藏触发器在输入中，导致系统在特定条件下表现异常，对高安全性应用构成威胁。

Method: 开发了一种新技术，用于检测面部识别网络是否被植入自然触发器，并识别这些触发器。

Result: 在受感染的网络中，识别触发器的前5准确率达到74%，优于基线方法的56%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了后门攻击的检测和识别能力，增强了面部识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在医学数据上预训练定制基础模型与从现有通用模型迁移学习的优劣，并通过案例研究验证了定制模型的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大规模未标记医学数据，研究者需要决定是预训练定制模型还是迁移学习，以及是否需要新方法。

Method: 使用DINOv2方法在200万张胎儿超声图像上预训练基础模型，并与多种预训练模型对比。

Result: 定制模型在三个胎儿超声数据集上取得最佳性能，表明即使数据较少，定制预训练仍优于迁移学习。

Conclusion: 在资源有限的情况下，应避免过度追求方法创新，直接使用现有方法训练定制基础模型即可。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS是一种新型混合卷积架构，用于遥感图像分类，通过傅里叶滤波门模块高效捕获全局上下文信息，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba）在适应2D视觉数据时需要复杂修改，可能降低效率。本文重新评估了循环SSMs的必要性。

Method: MambaOutRS采用堆叠门控CNN块进行局部特征提取，并引入傅里叶滤波门（FFG）模块在频域捕获全局信息，采用四阶段分层设计。

Result: 在UC Merced和AID数据集上分别达到98.41%和95.99%的F1分数，显著优于现有基线模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 通过门控卷积和频域门模块的组合，可以高效替代复杂的循环SSMs，为遥感等领域提供高性能且计算高效的模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常针对单一传感器或固定组合，限制了跨传感器的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SMARTIES模型，将异构传感器数据投影到共享频谱感知空间，使用统一的Transformer模型通过跨传感器令牌混合重建掩码多传感器数据。

Result: 在单模态和多模态任务中，SMARTIES优于依赖传感器特定预训练的模型。

Conclusion: SMARTIES为多传感器遥感数据处理提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Method: 利用时间序列多光谱图像和SAR数据的互补信息，通过Vision Transformer的注意力机制重建云覆盖区域的多光谱图像。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列多光谱和SAR数据或仅时间序列多光谱数据的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了云覆盖区域多光谱图像的重建质量，为早期作物制图提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR

both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

Conclusion: HOIverse数据集旨在加速涉及人类的场景理解研究。

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM实现了8.37%的准确率提升和7.47倍的注意力计算加速。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中表现出色，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Motivation: 大规模地球系统数据集（如遥感影像和气候模型输出）具有类似视频的特性，可以利用视频压缩技术减少冗余。

Method: 使用xarrayvideo库和ffmpeg工具，将多通道时空数据集编码为视频进行压缩。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上测试，压缩后PSNR表现优异，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效处理大型数据集的方法，压缩效果显著且实用。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

Motivation: SAM2在医学图像分割中依赖人工提示且存在领域偏移问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出SAM2-SGP框架，包括伪掩码生成模块（PMG）和伪掩码注意力模块（PMA），并采用低秩适应（LoRA）策略。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有模型（如nnUNet、SwinUNet）和基础模型（如SAM2、MedSAM2）。

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP通过自动化提示和领域适应策略，有效提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用CT切片间的关联和多层次特征，尤其是特定器官病变信息，影响了报告生成的准确性。

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上超越了基线模型，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效建模CT切片间的关联和多层次特征，显著提升了CT报告生成的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要准确的分子信息，但直接从基因组学获取成本高且耗时。PathLUPI旨在通过WSI预测分子特征和患者预后。

Method: PathLUPI在训练中使用转录组特权信息，提取基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，仅需WSI即可进行推理。

Result: 在49个分子肿瘤学任务中，PathLUPI表现优于传统方法，AUC≥0.80的任务有14个，C-index≥0.70的生存队列有5种主要癌症类型。

Conclusion: PathLUPI通过编码分子上下文优化WSI表示，克服现有模型限制，为临床病理工作流提供新策略。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

Result: 在颈部区域（包括颈动脉和甲状腺）的实验中验证了方法的有效性，提升了超声的解读性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望通过提升超声的解读性和易用性，使其更广泛地服务于非专业用户。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Motivation: 解决现有无监督或半监督异常检测方法在细粒度区分（如良性与恶性肿瘤）和超声图像设备敏感性方面的不足。

Method: 结合视觉原型与可学习文本嵌入，构建记忆库存储少量样本及其文本描述，优化图像特征与医学数据的对齐。

Result: 在三个乳腺超声数据集中，UltraAD在病灶定位和细粒度分类上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraAD通过融合视觉与语言信息，有效解决了医学图像分析中的领域差异和细粒度分类问题。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Motivation: 现有4D合成方法在生成多视图一致的动态场景方面受限，CoCo4D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将场景分为动态前景和背景，利用参考运动序列和渐进外推方案生成4D场景。

Result: 实验表明CoCo4D在4D场景生成中表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: CoCo4D有效解决了动态4D场景生成的挑战，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on

TL;DR: ProtoSolo是一种新型的可解释图像分类深度神经网络架构，仅需单个原型激活即可完成分类，显著降低解释的认知复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型网络通常依赖多个原型的协作决策来实现分类和解释，而ProtoSolo通过单个原型激活简化了这一过程。

Method: ProtoSolo采用基于特征的比较方法，使用特征图而非全通道特征向量进行相似性比较和原型学习，并提出非原型投影学习策略。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上的实验表明，ProtoSolo在分类任务中表现优异，且在解释认知复杂度方面达到最佳水平。

Conclusion: ProtoSolo通过简化原型激活和优化特征比较方法，实现了高效且可解释的图像分类。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: Bind-Your-Avatar模型有效解决了多角色对话视频生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了数据集和基准。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有技术，消融研究验证了各设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为级联视频超分辨率生成提供了简单有效的基线，为未来高效级联合成系统的设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

TL;DR: Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM) 是一种简单有效的渐进生成视觉媒体的框架，通过独立应用 Flow Matching 在多尺度表示中提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维视觉模态生成的计算密集型问题，避免复杂多阶段架构的缺点。

Method: 在多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级独立应用 Flow Matching。

Result: 在图像和视频生成中表现优异，Imagenet-1k 512px 上 FDD 分数提升 35.2%，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: DFM 以单一模型、架构简单性和最小修改实现显著优势。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Result: 实验表明，GenHSI能从单张场景图像生成保留场景内容和角色身份的长视频，具有合理的人-场景交互。

Conclusion: GenHSI首次实现了无需训练、具有一致相机姿态的长视频生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Motivation: 现有方法需要针对不同3D表示进行专门设计且计算复杂，本文提出更通用的2D图像质量评估方法。

Method: 训练一个模型在多视图设置中预测SSIM，用于指导视图选择。

Result: 在标准基准测试中取得显著定量和定性提升，运行速度比现有方法快14-33倍。

Conclusion: 提出的跨参考IQA框架对3D表示无关，且高效快速。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention

Conclusion: ScaleCap有效提升了图像描述的质量和多样性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

Conclusion: AnimaX为类别无关的3D动画提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的高计算成本限制了长视频的生成能力，通过观察时空能量衰减现象，提出了一种更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 采用Radial Attention，一种复杂度为O(n log n)的稀疏注意力机制，通过静态注意力掩码实现空间和时间上的衰减计算密度。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了Radial Attention的高效性，实现了1.9倍加速和4倍长视频生成能力。

Conclusion: Radial Attention显著提升了视频扩散模型的效率和扩展性，为长视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Motivation: 社交媒体快速发展导致有害内容传播加剧，现有数据集缺乏系统性、多样性和解释性，阻碍了有害模因检测的进一步研究。

Method: 引入MemeMind数据集，具备科学标准、大规模、多样性、双语支持和详细推理标注；提出MemeGuard框架，整合多模态信息和推理建模。

Result: MemeGuard在MemeMind数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind和MemeGuard填补了现有研究的空白，为有害模因检测提供了更可靠的基础和方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [89] [Assessing Risk of Stealing Proprietary Models for Medical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19464)
*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在医疗影像应用中取得成功，但专有模型面临模型窃取攻击的风险，且医疗影像模型的脆弱性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出QueryWise方法，利用公开数据集和代理分布的无标签数据，在有限查询预算下高效克隆模型功能。

Result: 在胆囊癌和COVID-19分类模型上验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 医疗影像模型在现实条件下易受MS攻击，QueryWise方法显著提升了攻击效率。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Conclusion: NIC-RobustBench为NIC鲁棒性评估提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper
demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and
employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at

Result: 在心血管疾病风险预测和五种病理分类任务中，Xray2Xray优于监督和自监督方法。

Conclusion: Xray2Xray的潜在表示能有效重建3D结构，提升诊断和预测性能。

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

Motivation: 心脏图像配准在医学分析中很重要，但现有深度学习方法速度慢且准确性不足，特别是在处理动态器官（如心脏）时。

Method: 设计了一种高效的卷积神经网络架构（DLNN），能够快速进行体积配准，并用于预测组织运动和量化应变。

Result: FLIR模型在保持高配准精度的同时，显著提高了计算速度，且应变计算结果非常一致。

Conclusion: FLIR模型是一种高效且可靠的心脏图像配准方法，适用于研究和临床环境。

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

Motivation: 现有无监督方法忽视ROI表示，弱监督方法依赖标签约束，限制了配准效果。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型表示ROI，提出Divide-and-Conquer Network独立对齐ROI特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于VoxelMorph，Dice分数提升显著。

Conclusion: EASR-DCN在准确性和变形减少方面表现优异，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

Result: 实验结果表明，PR-ICMH比之前的工作节省了高达29.57%的BD-rate。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在编码效率和灵活性上表现优异，适用于多种机器视觉任务。

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统卷积去噪自编码器（DAEs）在恢复高频细节（如牙科X光片中的细微解剖结构）方面表现不佳，而现有注意力机制可能忽略噪声区域的关键特征。

Method: 设计了噪声感知自注意力机制，使模型能够更有效地关注和恢复噪声区域的关键特征，并基于此构建了NAADA网络。

Conclusion: NAADA网络通过噪声感知自注意力机制显著提升了牙科X光片的去噪效果，为诊断提供了更高质量的图像。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

Conclusion: 稀疏配置结合深度学习是可行的低成本PET扫描方案，推动全身PET技术发展。

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

Motivation: 传统2D CNN无法利用切片间的解剖连续性，而3D模型需要大量标注数据，临床中不实用。

Method: 使用预训练的DeepLabV3提取单切片特征，ConvLSTM层整合切片间信息，保持空间结构。

Result: 在PROMISE12基准测试中，优于现有2D和3D模型，精度、召回率、IoU和DSC均更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床数据有限和噪声条件下具有鲁棒性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its
potential for robust clinical deployment.

Motivation: CBCT重建因X射线投影有限而成为病态问题，现有NeRF方法因哈希编码器与神经网络的局部-全局训练不匹配导致训练不稳定和重建质量下降。

Method: 引入归一化哈希编码器增强特征一致性，并提出映射一致性初始化策略预训练神经网络以提高稳定性。

Result: 方法在128个CT案例上显著提升训练效率和重建性能，覆盖7个不同解剖区域。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，仅需少量代码即可显著改善CBCT重建的训练稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

Motivation: 提高MRI中垂体腺瘤和腺体分割的准确性和效率，以辅助诊断和治疗。

Method: 回顾了34项采用自动和半自动分割方法的研究，分析技术和性能指标（如Dice分数）。

Result: 深度学习（尤其是U-Net）为主，自动方法Dice分数为0.19--89.00%（腺体）和4.60--96.41%（腺瘤）；半自动方法为80.00--92.10%（腺体）和75.90--88.36%（腺瘤）。

Conclusion: U-Net等自动分割技术有潜力，但需改进小结构分割和报告更多关键指标；更大、多样化的数据集对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

TL;DR: 该论文通过跨物种比较分析，揭示了人类和非人灵长类动物弓状束（AF）在连接模式上的差异，特别是人类AF在颞叶和额顶叶连接上的扩展，为语言网络的进化提供了神经解剖学基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清非人灵长类动物和人类AF的组织和连接差异，以理解人类语言网络的进化基础及其相关疾病的神经解剖学机制。

Method: 研究方法包括结合跨尺度单神经元追踪（病毒标记和荧光显微断层扫描）和11.7T扩散MRI全脑纤维追踪，辅以人类7.0T MRI的光谱嵌入分析，进行跨物种比较连接组学分析。

Result: 结果显示，猕猴AF起源于颞顶叶皮层，穿过听觉皮层和顶叶岛盖，投射到前额叶区域；而人类AF则扩展到中颞回，并具有更强的额顶叶连接。这些差异通过Kullback-Leibler分析量化，可能支持人类语言网络的进化特化。

Conclusion: 结论指出，人类AF更广泛的颞叶整合和强化的额顶叶连接为高级语言处理提供了连接基础，并为理解AF相关疾病（如失语症和阅读障碍）提供了神经解剖学框架。

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

Motivation: 小型无人机在室内和难以到达区域的部署潜力增加，但其飞行动力学和功耗问题限制了自主性和任务能力。

Method: 设计并评估了一个基于N3DR的流程，利用Instant-ngp、Nerfacto和Splatfacto等先进模型，通过小型无人机拍摄的图像提升3D重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，N3DR增强的流程显著优于传统的SfM算法，提高了重建质量。

Conclusion: N3DR技术有望推动小型无人机系统的能力提升。

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Motivation: 现有方法通过预留空间适应新类，但原型偏差和结构固定性限制了嵌入空间的表达能力。

Method: 设计了基于海马体联想记忆的记忆感知原型校准和动态结构匹配，确保特征和结构的一致性。

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200基准测试中，ConCM表现最优，增量会话的调和准确率分别提高了3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM通过几何最优性和最大匹配性，克服了对类数量先验的需求，提升了FSCIL的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Conclusion: NCT是一种模块化、数据高效且易于部署的方法，适用于高效可控的内容生成。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Result: OFTv2训练速度提升10倍，GPU内存使用降低3倍，且性能不降；在量化模型微调中优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2显著提升了正交微调的效率和实用性，适用于量化模型微调。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image
generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field
lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation
methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic
images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of
generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides
actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data
generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies
for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成图像模型在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在生成某些简单概念（如人手或四件物品）时仍频繁失败。这些失败模式是否反映模型的结构性限制尚不明确。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提取可解释的概念嵌入，通过量化比较真实图像与生成图像中概念的普遍性来识别盲点。训练了一个包含32,000个概念的RA-SAE模型。

Result: 应用于四种流行生成模型（Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, Kandinsky），揭示了特定被抑制的盲点（如鸟食器、DVD光盘）和夸大的盲点（如木质背景纹理）。

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架，通过评估生成模型与数据生成过程的概念保真度，系统识别其概念盲点。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as
indoor parking structures or dense urban canyons, achieving accurate and robust
vehicle positioning remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
cost-effective, vision-based multi-sensor navigation system that integrates
monocular depth estimation, semantic filtering, and visual map registration
(VMR) with 3-D digital maps. Extensive testing in real-world indoor and outdoor
driving scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system,
achieving sub-meter accuracy of 92% indoors and more than 80% outdoors, with
consistent horizontal positioning and heading average root mean-square errors
of approximately 0.98 m and 1.25 {\deg}, respectively. Compared to the
baselines examined, the proposed solution significantly reduced drift and
improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy
improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the
potential of cost-effective monocular vision systems combined with 3D maps for
scalable, GNSS-independent navigation in land vehicles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.
