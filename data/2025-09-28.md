TL;DR: 提出基于next-token probabilities的轻量级幻觉检测方法，使用传统ML模型替代计算密集的VLM评估，在保持性能的同时降低延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的幻觉问题影响可靠性，现有检测方法计算密集且增加延迟，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 训练传统ML模型基于VLM的next-token probabilities信号进行幻觉检测，结合视觉和语言NTP特征，并与VLM预测分数集成

Result: NTP特征能有效预测幻觉，轻量模型性能可与强VLM相媲美，集成方法优于单独使用VLM或NTP

Conclusion: 基于NTP的轻量级方法为增强VLM可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决独立于书写者的离线手写签名验证问题，通过生成合成SPD数据来训练模型，在真实数据集上取得了低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者的场景下具有挑战性，传统方法依赖真实签名数据集进行训练，但真实数据获取困难。研究旨在探索在黎曼空间中生成合成数据的潜力，减少对真实数据的依赖。

Method: 基于对称正定矩阵的黎曼几何，使用少量真实样本作为种子，通过黎曼高斯混合模型识别黎曼中心作为合成书写者，利用黎曼高斯采样生成正负样本的合成SPD群体，采用度量学习框架处理相似和不相似的SPD点对。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上进行了实验，在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下均取得了低错误率，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据用于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，为准合成数据生成提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，通过优化的扩散变换器和VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统T2I系统功能单一，缺乏交互性和多维创作能力。Seedream 4.0旨在将传统文本到图像系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创意工具。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量，结合对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等技术加速推理，并通过多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务。

Result: 在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，2K图像生成时间仅需1.8秒，支持多图像参考和多图像输出，在复杂任务中表现出卓越的多模态能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将生成AI的边界推向创意和专业应用领域，成为一个强大的交互式多维创作工具。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的半监督框架，使用Resnet-50在少量标注数据上实现乳腺癌检测，在INbreast和MIAS数据集上达到96.7%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测至关重要。深度学习虽然有效但受限于标注数据不足，需要开发能在小标注数据集上表现优异的方法

Method: 使用对比学习框架，通过相似性指数在大量未标注乳腺X光片数据上训练Resnet-50，采用多种数据增强技术，最后在少量标注数据上进行微调

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决标注数据不足的问题，在乳腺癌检测任务中表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像数据上的表现，发现它们在真实工业数据上失败，但在公共基准数据集上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型在零样本设置下的跨领域泛化能力，替代繁琐的标注任务，实现制造业中自动化质量检测，以节省模型设置和实施的工作量。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个近期的基础模型，比较它们在两类数据上的表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上失败，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在当前阶段可能不适用于真实工业环境的质量检测任务，需要进一步改进以适应工业应用场景。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）来解决AI模型中针对特定高精度任务的定制化策略在模块化任务序列中的效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型大多针对特定高精度任务定制，但在处理一系列模块化任务时效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器框架预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，编码器学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，使多个下游AI模块能共享同一特征空间。采用轻量级CNN骨干网络而非大型Transformer。

Result: 证明了在NS中可高效执行去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块任务。

Conclusion: 该架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，且轻量级设计支持更广泛的硬件部署。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合高置信度流式策略和多样性方法的选择性图像训练策略，在保持低传输成本的同时最大化边缘设备模型质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统需要定期更新模型以适应不断变化的环境，但传输大量数据到中央服务器标注成本高昂，需要选择最有用的图像进行训练

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略结合多样性方法，选择最有价值的图像进行训练，在相似训练负载下最小化数据集查询次数

Result: 该方法能够产生高质量模型，同时保持最小的数据集查询量

Conclusion: 通过智能选择训练图像，可以在保持低传输成本的同时有效提升边缘设备模型性能

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂风格的服装生成控制，无需手动绘制精确掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法需要用户手动绘制精确的二进制掩码来控制生成布局，这既困难又需要专业知识，且在某些复杂场景下（如卷起袖子）无法实现。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本风格指令，实现无需手动掩码的虚拟试穿。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，能够实现最先进的结果，并提供风格控制功能。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了用户体验，自动化了多轮图像生成过程，解决了传统掩码方法无法处理的复杂试穿场景。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上针对不同难度级别实现了高准确率（96.7%-99.54%），但阈值选择对性能影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹识别在边境管控、法医学和财政准入等应用中面临挑战，攻击者可能故意修改指纹脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别被篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集的三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值（0.92）下，三个难度级别的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%；但当阈值放松到0.72时，准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于需要安全性和识别弹性的实际部署场景。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 提升双手机器人操作的性能，通过利用预训练视觉模型的语义理解能力来增强体素表示的质量。

Method: 从自监督ViT模型DINOv2提取注意力图，将其解释为RGB图像的像素级显著性分数，然后将这些图提升到3D体素网格中，并将得到的体素级语义线索整合到行为克隆策略中。

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，与最先进的基于体素的策略相比，注意力引导的特征化方法在所有任务上实现了平均绝对提升8.2%，相对增益21.9%。

Conclusion: 将预训练视觉Transformer的注意力图集成到体素表示中能显著提升双手机器人操作的性能，证明了语义线索在机器人操作任务中的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究对YOLO和RT-DETR系列的36个实时目标检测模型进行了蓝莓检测基准测试，使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，并通过半监督学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度权衡的深度学习模型。

Method: 使用包含661张图像的蓝莓数据集评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)共36个模型变体，并采用基于Unbiased Mean Teacher的半监督学习在1,035张未标记图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50；半监督学习后RT-DETR-v2-X最佳性能达94.8% mAP@50。

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得良好平衡，半监督学习能提升性能但需要更深入研究跨域未标记数据的利用。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的ROI增强策略，通过在训练时随机替换全图像为ROI裁剪区域，在Mini-DDSM数据集上实现了乳腺癌筛查性能的适度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光检查对早期乳腺癌检测至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于有限分辨率和小样本量，需要开发无需额外标签或架构修改的数据增强方法。

Method: 在训练过程中，以概率p_roi=0.10将全图像替换为从预计算的无标签边界框库中随机采样的ROI裁剪区域，并加入抖动增加变异性，保持推理成本不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强策略带来了ROC-AUC的适度提升（性能随交叉验证折数变化），PR-AUC持平或略有下降，训练效率指标（吞吐量和GPU内存）得到评估。

Conclusion: 简单的数据中心ROI策略可以在受限环境下增强乳腺X光分类性能，无需额外标签或架构修改。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用镜像反射作为辅助视图构建虚拟相机，实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常环境中常见的镜像反射可同时提供真实视图和虚拟反射视图，利用这一特性简化3D重建的成像过程

Method: 设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换，直接生成像素域虚拟视图；提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计；支持动态场景逐帧几何恢复

Result: 构建包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集进行定量评估，在真实和合成数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法利用镜像反射实现单图像多视角立体视觉，为通用且鲁棒的3D重建提供了简化方案

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街道级语言引导框架，通过全景视频分析建筑物立面特征来评估灾后建筑物可居住性，采用两阶段决策策略实现高精度可居住性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑物可居住性评估对分类、检查、公用事业重新供电和公平资源分配至关重要。虽然航空影像能快速覆盖大面积区域，但往往无法捕捉决定可居住性的立面特征，而街景影像虽然能捕捉这些细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: FacadeTrack框架将全景视频与地块关联，校正立面视图，并提取可解释属性（如入口阻塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片）。采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精确度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848，相比一阶段基线的精确度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了残余错误发生的位置和原因。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了可审计、可扩展的可居住性评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过揭示错误原因实现有针对性的质量控制。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单移动形状识别社会互动，发现语义模型（特别是基于动词的嵌入）比视觉特征更能解释人类的社会感知相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从简单的移动形状中识别社会互动，但之前的研究主要关注视觉特征。本研究旨在探索人类使用哪些语义表征来补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述的语义嵌入模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于描述的动词嵌入最能解释人类的相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，连接了视觉和抽象表征。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 解决跨视角地理定位中因无人机视角和方向变化导致的严重外观变化问题，以及建立同时捕捉全局语义和局部细节的可靠对应关系。

Method: 提出EGS框架：1）使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征；2）构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构，实现全局语义的聚合和局部重分配。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中取得显著性能提升，建立了跨域CVGL的新state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合几何等变特征提取和全局-局部一致性机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Result: 该方法为精确的红外小目标检测和定位提供了有前景的解决方案，在统一框架中结合了结构语义和边缘细化。

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络通过解耦边缘增强和语义建模，有效解决了红外小目标检测中的特征对齐挑战，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Motivation: 传统的意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽视了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。需要研究多个个体通过行动和互动产生的共享目标。

Method: 提出SHOT数据集（包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个摄像头视角，标注6种个体属性）和GIFT框架（提取细粒度个体特征并建模群体动态）。

Result: 实验结果证实了SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了群体意图预测的新范式，为理解集体行为提供了重要工具和数据集。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来提升海上目标检测性能，特别是在数据稀缺和泛化能力差的场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺和跨不同海上属性（如物体类别、视角、位置和成像环境）的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如公海环境）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包括：1）X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，使用双向物体-水注意力模块捕捉物体与水域边界的交互；2）属性相关主动采样，基于任务相关性动态选择合成样本；3）构建首个面向生成式海上学习的海事生成数据集。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过数据中心的生成-选择方法有效解决了海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: STELLA是第一个用于长期月球测绘的端到端陨石坑导航管道，结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有陨石坑导航方法主要针对短时动力下降任务，而月球测绘任务涉及稀疏、倾斜图像采集，在变化光照条件下持续长达一年，对姿态估计提出更大挑战。

Method: 开发了STELLA管道，包含陨石坑检测、识别、姿态求解和轨道确定模块。同时创建了CRESENT-365数据集模拟一年期月球测绘任务。

Result: 在CRESENT+和CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在不同视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了应考量的操作条件。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Motivation: 研究深度视觉和语言模型在各自模态上训练后，其表示空间如何部分对齐，探索对齐出现的位置、支持的线索、是否捕捉人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及示例聚合如何影响对齐。

Method: 系统研究对齐在模型中的出现位置、视觉或语言线索的支持、人类偏好的捕捉，以及示例聚合的影响。使用强制选择的“Pick-a-Pic”任务评估人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的一致性。

Result: 对齐在模型中层到深层最明显；对齐对仅外观变化鲁棒，但对语义变化（如对象移除或词序打乱）敏感；人类偏好与模型嵌入空间一致；示例聚合增强而非模糊对齐。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于共享语义代码，与人类判断一致，且通过示例聚合增强对齐。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化图像合成任务中存在几何控制不足、风格一致性差以及需要大量训练的问题。

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容控制。

Result: 该方法能够生成几何控制精确、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过3D几何信息有效解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer框架统一了生成和重建过程，实现了三个流的生成，为个性化模型提供全面的训练自由控制，无需为每个模型重新训练控制器。

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG中的挑战，通过双监督和非对称设计提升了模型在存在领域偏移时的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于DEIM框架的成功，希望进一步扩展其能力，通过集成更先进的DINOv3特征来提升检测性能，同时覆盖从GPU到移动端的全场景部署需求。

Method: 1. 对X/L/M/S规模模型：采用DINOv3预训练骨干网络，引入STA将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；2. 对超轻量模型：使用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝；3. 统一设计包括简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O机制。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的架构设计，在不同规模模型上都实现了优越的性能-成本权衡，为实时目标检测领域设立了新的技术标杆，特别在轻量化模型方面表现突出。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DAC-LoRA框架，将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中，通过动态对抗课程提升Vision-Language Models的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models在关键应用中易受对抗攻击，而现有的参数高效微调方法如LoRA无法有效应对这些安全威胁

Method: 基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失，设计动态对抗课程，逐步增加攻击难度，集成到标准PEFT流程中

Result: 在不显著牺牲清洁准确率的前提下，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA提供了一种轻量级、广泛适用的方法，能够有效增强Vision-Language Models的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 提出FedDSPG方法，通过生成领域特定软提示来解决联邦学习中的领域泛化问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的联邦领域泛化方法学习到的提示多样性有限，且容易忽略未知领域的信息

Method: 为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端生成模型中，在推理阶段使用生成器获取未见目标领域的DSPs

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在FDG任务中优于现有强基线

Conclusion: FedDSPG从生成视角有效解决了联邦领域泛化问题，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）中提示引导采样策略的黑盒投毒攻击方法，通过闭环优化策略抑制有害帧相关性得分，攻击成功率高达82%-99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频大语言模型的性能在帧采样策略上不断进步，从均匀采样到语义相似性采样，再到最新的提示引导采样，但之前采样策略的漏洞已被发现，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: PoisonVID通过闭环优化策略，利用基于影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型（GPT-4o-mini）构建的释义有害描述集，迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧相关性得分。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上的全面评估显示，PoisonVID实现了82%-99%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性，以应对此类安全威胁。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数动态平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，解决了QAT-KD方法中梯度冲突问题，在低比特量化下显著提升小量化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，由于梯度幅度的异质性导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数自适应平衡TS和KD目标；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务上，GoR均优于现有QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为资源受限硬件上的AI模型部署提供了鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下甚至能超越全精度模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 评估大规模网络收集的噪声训练数据（包含标签错误）能否与专家验证的小型数据集竞争，以推动大规模植物识别系统的发展。

Method: 创建了两个训练数据集：一个是从网络收集的大规模噪声数据集，另一个是专家验证的小型可信数据集。测试数据来自第三方Pl@ntNet移动应用。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性，每年都有新品种被培育，无法为所有物种建立独立的计数模型。现有类无关计数和开放世界检测模型对非刚性结构的植物计数效果不佳。

Method: 基于普通视觉Transformer，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT图像分割中常产生解剖学不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 开发了完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层和病变的联合学习，利用双向影响机制，并学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公开和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该模型在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能使用部分标注训练数据将层分割推广到病理情况。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒和可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用LLMs作为知识引擎，但图像描述通常包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs对VQA任务理解有限，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例并对描述进行总结和重排，排除无关信息，帮助LLMs更好地理解图像和问题。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，表现优异。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过优化图像描述处理，显著提升了LLMs在知识型VQA任务中的推理能力和适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与它们作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 进行了系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，并研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化之间存在不匹配；判别器能有效抑制优化过程中的伪影，但其学习表示在IQA模型重用中效果有限；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏差的影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化的问答场景。需要同时解决对象交互理解和数据集偏差两个关键问题。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，包含两个核心组件：1）对象交互自注意力机制，用于捕捉图像中对象间的复杂交互关系；2）基于GAN的去偏框架，生成无偏数据分布以学习更鲁棒的特征。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型在存在偏差和不平衡数据分布的情况下表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏差对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA模型为这一方向提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 视频序列中常存在结构化噪声和背景伪影，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变化性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核扩散方法进行视频分解和去雾处理。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保留（KS统计量）方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Method: 探索两种生成过程中的伪影类型：潜在分布偏差和解码引起的平滑效应。利用基于马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性重建合成图像，暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出仅含110万参数的轻量级神经网络FerretNet。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中平均准确率达到97.1%，比现有最优方法提升10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析局部像素依赖关系，能够有效检测合成图像中的生成伪影，实现高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于概念瓶颈模型的视频分类框架，通过Transformer架构处理任意长度视频序列，提供全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性的多视角解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将概念瓶颈模型从静态图像扩展到视频数据面临挑战，因为视频具有时间依赖性，这对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 提出MoTIF框架，采用Transformer架构，将视频中的概念定义为语义实体（如物体、属性或高级组件），这些概念随时间重复出现形成主题，共同描述和解释动作。

Result: 概念建模范式可以有效迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的同时，能够更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型应用于视频分类，为视频理解提供了可解释的框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and

effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 在无人机野火监测等安全关键任务中，需要对检测到的物体进行3D定位。传统方法如密集深度估计或3D场景重建在远距离物体或计算资源受限的情况下不可行。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理单目标和多目标场景的3D定位问题，结合相机姿态估计和图像分割结果，通过3D仿真和无人机图像序列进行验证。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器方法独立于检测方法，具有很好的灵活性，结合现有的图像分割模型可用于无人机野火监测等实际应用。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

TL;DR: 提出了SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Mamba模型依赖全局扫描，忽视了遥感图像中关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度

Method: SwinMamba集成局部Mamba风格扫描与全局感受野，前两阶段进行局部扫描捕获细节，后两阶段全局扫描融合上下文信息，使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SwinMamba是遥感图像语义分割的有效解决方案，具有处理局部和全局特征的优越能力

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于pack的MIL框架，通过打包可变长度的特征序列为固定长度来解决计算病理学中WSI序列长度极端变化的问题，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动的下采样器来提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的WSI具有极长的序列长度（高达200K）、显著的长度变化（200到200K）和有限的监督，导致高数据异质性和冗余。传统方法在有限监督下保持这种异质性时往往牺牲训练效率和优化。

Method: 提出pack-based MIL框架，将多个采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列，实现批量训练同时保持数据异质性。引入残差分支将多个幻灯片丢弃的特征组合成超幻灯片，并使用定制标签进行训练。同时采用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，该方法实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法通过有效处理序列长度变化和有限监督问题，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种基于扩散模型的物理约束人体运动生成方法，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用模拟器进行运动投影来确保物理合理性，但模拟器的顺序性导致计算成本高昂且无法并行化。需要一种更高效的方法来生成物理合理的人体运动。

Method: 将模拟器约束解释为扩散过程中的引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中，避免推理时的重复模拟器调用。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，提供对物理系数的细粒度控制，并在未见过的环境参数组合上表现出组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将物理约束集成到扩散模型中，实现了高效且可控的物理合理运动生成，解决了传统模拟器方法计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别鲁棒性设计模式，并通过理论分析（如低通stem卷积核的噪声衰减、平均池化与最大池化的对比、CLIP ViT的像素空间Lipschitz边界）解释这些发现。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论支持，并建立了实用的即插即用指南，用于设计更抗高斯噪声的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,

(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，能够在无需预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型的情况下，实现SSL学习器的冷启动，用于深度图像聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为前提条件，这限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 首先从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，并设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；然后利用实例级分类能力跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高级相似性，为伪标记数据分配聚类级标签；最后使用分配了聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比，准确率差距非常小（例如在CIFAR-10上仅为1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有的SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD为SSL学习器在深度图像聚类任务中的冷启动提供了一种有效的解决方案，无需任何前提条件，具有优异的性能和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers作为视觉基础模型会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，从而削弱大模型的增益效果。

Method: 提出SiNGER框架，通过零空间引导的扰动来精炼教师特征，在抑制伪影的同时保留信息信号。使用基于LoRA的适配器实现高效扰动，仅需最小结构修改。

Result: 大量实验表明，SiNGER能持续提升学生模型性能，在多个下游任务中达到最先进水平，并产生更清晰、更可解释的表征。

Conclusion: SiNGER成功解决了知识蒸馏中伪影抑制和信息保留的固有权衡问题，为Vision Transformers的知识蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

TL;DR: SNCE是一种基于单神经元的概念擦除方法，通过操纵单个神经元精确防止有害内容生成，同时最小化对图像质量的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然具有强大的图像生成能力，但存在生成有害内容的安全风险。现有概念擦除方法难以在精确移除目标概念的同时保持图像质量

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器将文本嵌入映射到稀疏解耦的潜在空间，设计基于调制频率激活模式评分的新神经元识别方法，定位有害概念相关神经元并抑制其激活

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SNCE在目标概念擦除方面达到最先进效果，同时保持非目标概念的生成能力，对对抗攻击表现出强鲁棒性

Conclusion: SNCE通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，为文本到图像模型的安全部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KD-SS的轻量级点云采样算法，用于植物器官分割，无需对输入数据进行降采样，能够处理全分辨率点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物点云分割方法通常针对特定植物物种或传感器模式，且需要大量预处理和降采样来满足硬件或神经网络输入要求。

Method: KD-SS算法是一种简单有效的生物点云子采样方法，不依赖于传感器数据和植物物种，可与当前最先进的分割模型结合使用。

Result: 在不同模态（摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR）和各种植物物种上的评估显示，该方法取得了令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: KD-SS作为轻量级分辨率保持替代方案，适用于任何植物物种和传感器模式的植物器官分割，可替代计算密集的预处理和降采样方法。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的前景-背景分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中存在的局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景提取策略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本分布外检测方法在FG-BG分解时存在两个主要问题：过度依赖局部类别相似性导致鲁棒性低，以及固定的背景补丁提取策略不够灵活。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优，根据不同样本灵活选择背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置方面相比SOTA方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过结合局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，减少了先前方法对局部类别相似性的依赖，并通过灵活的补丁选择策略提高了检测性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新的数据集分割方法IPS和WDES，专门针对图像分割任务中的标签分布不平衡问题，能够生成更具代表性的测试集，提高模型评估的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割任务中随机分割数据集常导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。现有的分层采样方法在分类任务中有效，但难以直接应用于具有多标签结构和类别不平衡的分割任务。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) IPS（迭代像素分层）- 基于标签感知的简单采样方法；2) WDES（Wasserstein驱动的进化分层）- 使用遗传算法最小化Wasserstein距离，优化数据集分割间的标签分布相似性。

Result: WDES方法能够持续生成更具代表性的数据集分割，在各种分割任务（街景、医学影像、卫星图像）中表现出更低的性能方差和更好的模型评估效果，特别在处理小规模、不平衡和低多样性数据集时优势明显。

Conclusion: WDES方法在解决图像分割数据集分割偏差问题上具有显著优势，特别是在数据稀缺和多样性不足的情况下，能够提供更可靠的模型评估基准。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型大多依赖部件标注或复杂技术来自动提取注意力图，但基于部件的方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此作者希望利用语义层次结构来提升分类性能。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联以层次结构（分类法）的形式作为监督信号集成到端到端深度神经网络中，不依赖裁剪技术或手动标注。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个知名数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的SOTA方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需复杂的裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度识别提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统应用的增加，其安全性变得至关重要。虽然ViTs相比CNNs具有更好的性能和对抗扰动的鲁棒性，但它们仍然容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，需要研究这种跨架构的脆弱性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation (CT)技术设计现实对抗性补丁，在人物分类任务中测试四个微调的ViT模型，研究CNN对抗攻击技术向ViT模型的迁移性。

Result: 实验结果显示不同ViT模型的攻击成功率差异很大：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16达到99.97%，其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 证实了对抗性补丁从CNNs到ViTs的跨架构迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的抵抗力。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念转移方法在精确控制和编辑性方面存在局限，需要更细粒度的分解机制来提升视频编辑质量。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景、背景、运动流）和Chain-of-Prompt时间步分解，采用双到单流DiT架构和自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和编辑性方面超越现有基线，实现高质量可控视频概念转移。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步分解为视频概念转移提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理来分析静态感知结果，受到感知阶段固定性的限制。需要一种能够动态优化感知过程的推理增强方法。

Method: 提出视觉测试时缩放（VTTS）方法，采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理过程。还构建了VTTS-80K数据集支持该范式。

Result: Videochat-R1.5模型在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，优于Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型，涵盖视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLMs的推理性能，证明了迭代感知在增强多模态理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks

Result: 基于乳腺X光片数据训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，与放射科医生工作流程更一致；微调增强特定概念类别（如良性钙化）但减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了CNN如何捕获乳腺X光片特定知识，显示领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习，在专业化和泛化之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即使最终答案正确，中间推理过程也可能偏离视频动态，这影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于DTW的过程奖励机制，通过将推理轨迹与时间锚定的参考对齐来实现过程监督，无需辅助奖励模型。同时构建MOSS-Video基准数据集用于训练和评估。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，且在不同架构（Qwen2.5-VL、Phi-2）上均表现一致。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提升视频推理的过程一致性，产生更稳定可靠的推理轨迹，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过整合相机和物体运动为像素运动，能够有效生成符合相机轨迹的视频，同时保持物体运动的一致性，在性能上显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在研究判别器在什么条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器性能的影响。通过理论分析探讨不同复杂度水平下生成器的学习能力和判别器的检测能力。

Result: 研究发现：简单数据集几乎能被生成器完美学习，极端多样化数据集会掩盖生成缺陷，而中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测，因为生成器无法完全捕获分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，中等复杂度数据集为判别器提供了最佳检测条件，这对理解生成对抗动态具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时的计算效率问题，同时保持模型性能，需要一种能够自适应调整分辨率的方法。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，结合键值缓存和因果跨层注意力机制，在推理时从低分辨率开始并根据需要逐步细化。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中，通过简单的基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应提前退出，仅需轻量级蒸馏即可达到竞争性精度并显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波基令牌化实现了单一模型的多分辨率自适应推理，在保持精度的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Method: 通过大规模评估量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅评估了分布内准确性，还评估了包括校准性和OOD检测在内的全面可靠性指标，并分析了预训练来源对结果的影响。

Result: 量化能一致地改善通常欠自信的预训练模型的校准性，但可能降低过自信变体的校准性。有趣的是，校准性下降并不妨碍其他可靠性指标的提升，OOD检测性能仍可能改善。某些量化感知训练方法能在零样本准确性、校准性和OOD鲁棒性上同时获得提升。

Conclusion: 量化在高效、可靠和鲁棒的视觉语言模型部署中具有超越传统角色的作用，为多目标优化问题提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万样本和200万唯一表格，88%保留原始可视化，旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有VTU数据集提供固定示例和单一可视化，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含图像-HTML配对表示、全面元数据和溯源信息，使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调模型提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形预测的新方法，通过控制解释的保真度来改进图像预测的特征归因解释。该方法识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征归因方法广泛用于解释图像预测，但现有方法的鲁棒性差异大，且不能忠实反映黑盒模型的推理过程。

Method: 提出了四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，通过共形预测方法识别关键特征子集，确保排除其他特征后模型预测保持不变。

Result: 在6个图像数据集上使用5种解释器进行实证评估，结果显示FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率（解释区域大小）方面均优于竞争方法，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控制保真度的特征归因解释框架，FastSHAP表现最佳，超像素方法优于像素级方法，为可靠模型解释提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合、分层对齐学习和统一预训练来解决语义基础弱、局部全局不平衡和跨模态学习效率低的问题，在多个任务上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个关键限制：1）语义基础弱，模型难以将骨骼运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层级最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译等多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，涵盖不同手语和口语。

Conclusion: Sigma证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的有效性，以及骨骼数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 本文对文本-图像生成评估指标进行了系统性研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，不同指标在不同类型的组合问题上表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术快速发展，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估主要依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度被采用，而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。研究超越了简单的相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示：1）没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致；2）性能随组合问题类型变化；3）基于VQA的指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；4）某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下更强；5）仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了仔细和透明选择指标的重要性，既是为了可信的评估，也是为了将它们作为生成中的奖励模型使用。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表征，现有方法难以同时捕捉局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖

Method: 集成Mamba架构（擅长长程全局依赖）和GNN（强调细粒度短程空间交互），采用基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法

Conclusion: 集成架构结合自适应融合策略在计算病理学中显示出强大潜力，为空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一框架，支持点云、体素、边界框和骨骼姿态等多种条件信号；采用单一跨模态架构处理所有模态；使用渐进式难度感知采样策略进行训练。

Result: 实验表明额外控制提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过多模态控制和先进训练策略，显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN模型经常利用表面相关性进行'作弊'预测，而现有基于概念监督和解释正则化的方法依赖人工标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，并引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够自动引导模型注意力，提高决策的可靠性和认知合理性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized

spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型的评估主要关注对齐性，即检查提示中指定的元素是否出现，但忽略了模型在提示之外生成的内容。需要明确定义和评估T2I模型中的幻觉现象。

Method: 将T2I模型中的幻觉定义为基于偏见的偏差，并提出了包含属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为T2I模型评估设定了上限，并揭示了隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的T2I模型评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: 明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类框架有助于识别和量化模型偏见驱动的生成偏差。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法在真实场景中表现不佳，因为个体间差异导致相同动作表现不同，阻碍了模型的鲁棒泛化

Method: 框架包含特征层和损失层两个即插即用组件：特征层通过时频对齐模块归一化个体运动特征；损失层通过组不变正则化损失模拟未见个体分布

Conclusion: 该框架通过分布鲁棒优化有效解决了微动作识别中的个体差异问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的泛化能力

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，通过保留VGGT的几何感知能力并适应跨实例语义匹配场景，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构）和最近邻规则（忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体稠密对应机制。

Method: 重用VGGT早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下采用循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方案。

Result: 实验表明该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过将3D几何基础模型VGGT适应到语义匹配场景，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更优的语义匹配性能。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了MedVSR框架，专门针对医学视频超分辨率问题，通过Cross State-Space Propagation和Inner State-Space Reconstruction模块解决医学视频中的对齐困难和伪影问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但受硬件限制和生理约束难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧间突变等独特挑战，容易产生伪影和扭曲特征

Method: 1. Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP)：通过状态空间模型将远距离帧投影为控制矩阵，选择性传播一致且信息丰富的特征；2. Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR)：结合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合，增强组织结构并减少伪影

Result: 在四个医学场景数据集（包括内窥镜和白内障手术）上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有VSR模型

Conclusion: MedVSR为医学视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案，能够生成更准确、更可靠的超分辨率医学视频，有助于提升临床诊断的准确性

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VAS数据选择策略来解决GRPO框架中梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模高质量的多模态推理数据集和模型，在数学推理基准上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两大限制：缺乏高质量的长链思维数据和强化学习训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，基于Variance Promotion Score (VPS)结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布了包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模数据集。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提数据和VAS方法的有效性，理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度的大小。

Conclusion: VAS是稳定策略优化的实用机制，发布的资源为社区提供了标准化基准，代码、数据和检查点均已开源。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的基础模型，通过预训练Sentinel-3 OLCI数据进行数据重建，并在海洋监测任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，基础模型在预训练大规模未标记数据后，有望显著改善海洋AI应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构预训练Sentinel-3 OLCI数据，通过微调评估模型在叶绿素浓度定量和海洋初级生产力估计两个下游任务中的性能。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉海洋颜色详细空间模式方面表现优异，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有望为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的洞察。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的图像合成框架，通过流形引导锚点损失和退化抑制引导等技术，解决了复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的图像合成难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现有的文本到图像扩散模型虽然具备物理和分辨率先验知识，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE提出流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练的自定义适配器（如IP-Adapter）来指导潜在表示，确保主体忠实表示的同时保持背景完整性。还引入了退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合技术来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE为高质量图像合成提供了一个有效的训练免费解决方案，并通过引入ComplexCompo基准为领域提供了严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是一个针对十亿级视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样性采样技术，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的3D重建模型（如VGGT）计算和内存成本过高，阻碍实际部署。传统后训练量化方法在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，多视图3D数据使得校准样本选择不稳定。

Method: 提出QuantVGGT框架，包含两个关键技术：1）双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2）噪声过滤多样性采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样性校准集群以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 在不同基准测试和位宽下均达到最先进结果，4位量化可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，重建精度保持在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有显著优势和实用性，为大规模3D重建模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

TL;DR: 提出NewtonGen框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND）将物理原理融入视频生成过程，解决现有文本到视频生成模型在物理一致性和可控性方面的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到视频生成模型存在物理不一致性问题，如物体向上坠落、速度和方向的突变等，且缺乏精确的参数控制能力。这些问题的根本原因是模型仅从外观学习运动分布，而缺乏对底层动力学的理解。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，整合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理。核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND），能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，从而将潜在的动力学约束注入视频生成过程。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导实现物理一致的视频合成。

Result: NewtonGen能够实现物理一致的视频合成，并具有精确的参数控制能力，解决了现有模型在物理一致性和可控性方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理相结合，NewtonGen框架为文本到视频生成提供了物理一致性和精确可控性的解决方案，为大规模视频生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step

gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 广泛实验证明VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

Motivation: 短视频平台已成为健康建议的重要来源，但其中混杂着有用、误导性和有害内容。研究旨在理解这些内容如何通过特定包装方式建立可信度，而非判断其真实性。

Method: 收集了152个来自TikTok、Instagram和YouTube的公开视频，采用包含自动语音识别、结构化帧选择和多模态模型的透明标注流程，对26个特征进行人工验证标注。

Result: 发现自信的单一主持人在家庭或工作室环境中占主导地位，临床背景罕见。权威信号（如头衔、图表、证书）常与说服性元素（术语、引用、恐惧诉求、批判主流医学、阴谋论）和盈利模式（销售链接、订阅号召）同时出现。

Conclusion: 科学类视觉元素和引用往往与情感化和对立性叙事结合，而非体现克制性，揭示了短视频健康内容中可信度构建的复杂机制。

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Motivation: 解决高度混合数据在盲高光谱解混中的挑战，传统方法在数据高度混合时端元估计精度下降

Method: 使用最优传输度量目标丰度分布与真实丰度分布之间的差异，并将其作为正则化项加入优化问题；采用无监督深度学习方法实现

Result: 实验表明该方法在高度混合数据下能更好地估计端元，且对目标丰度分布的选择具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于最优传输的正则化方法有效提升了盲高光谱解混在高度混合数据下的性能

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规性。规则由LLM生成并结构化到知识图中。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机或区分SUV和轿车），同时改进传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: 通过结合规则编码与学习表示，DARTVAE比纯数据驱动模型实现更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型设置中的实用性。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征之间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该方法在保持所有信号结构的同时仅消除群作用带来的变化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，与朴素特征OT相比，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划在类别保持准确性方面表现更好，能够捕获数据集中底层语义标签结构的有意义对应关系，同时消除不影响类别或内容的干扰变化。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT是一种有效的对称感知最优传输方法，能够更好地处理对称性丰富的场景，提高对应关系的质量。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个公平性增强的无数据鲁棒性蒸馏框架FERD，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决现有方法忽视的鲁棒公平性问题，显著提升了最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间的鲁棒性差异问题，导致学生模型在不同类别上表现出严重的鲁棒性不均衡。

Method: FERD框架采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，并生成公平感知示例和均匀目标对抗示例来优化分布。通过特征级预测的均匀性约束和均匀目标类约束，实现更平衡的类别表示。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了无数据鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题，为鲁棒性蒸馏提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是一个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，结合数值序列、元数据、线图图像和描述，提供更全面的时间序列推理评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，且忽略元数据和视觉表示，无法满足真实世界应用需求。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集构建基准，采用可扩展的管道生成参考描述：使用LLM生成描述并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，同时提供579个人工精炼的测试描述。

Result: 建立了包含460个多选题的基准，提出定制评估指标，并对领先的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述管道为时间序列分析与基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码变换器自编码器的方法，用于重建胎儿心率监测中缺失的数据信号，解决可穿戴设备因运动导致信号丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。可穿戴胎儿心率监测器在孕妇活动时容易产生信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特性，限制了AI风险预测算法的开发。

Method: 使用掩码变换器自编码器方法，通过捕捉数据的空间和频率成分来重建缺失的胎儿心率信号。该方法对不同程度的缺失数据具有鲁棒性，可用于信号修复和预测。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效处理可穿戴监测设备产生的信号缺失问题，为AI风险算法开发提供可靠数据支持。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来有望集成到可穿戴监测设备中，实现更早期和更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视线性降维作为简单、数据适应的防御方法，通过理论和实验证明稀疏主成分分析（SPCA）比标准PCA在对抗攻击下具有更好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务上表现优异但容易受到精心设计的对抗性扰动攻击。作者希望找到一种简单有效的数据适应防御方法。

Method: 比较标准PCA和稀疏PCA（SPCA）作为前端特征提取器，结合理论分析和实验验证。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，实验方面测试了在白盒和黑盒攻击下的性能。

Result: SPCA在强白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现出更平缓的性能下降，同时保持竞争力的清洁准确率。稀疏投影通过减少对抗性杠杆来提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 稀疏投影机制能够有效降低对抗性攻击的影响，这一优势在线性和非线性设置中都得到了验证，为对抗性防御提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度框架的一个特例，限制了算法在遗忘质量和收敛性方面的优化空间。

Method: 构建了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，通过分析不同f-散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响，允许用户根据具体应用选择最优散度函数。

Result: 研究表明不同f-散度会显著影响遗忘算法的收敛特性和遗忘质量，为特定应用场景提供了灵活的权衡选择。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更灵活的方法，能够在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新的基准，展示了基于物理分解的方法在复杂系统建模中的优势。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver代表了向通用3D环境生成迈出的重要一步，通过智能体框架实现了更全面、更灵活的室内场景合成

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

TL;DR: ArtUV是一种全自动端到端方法，用于生成艺术家风格的UV展开，通过两阶段流程（缝线预测和参数化）解决传统方法在语义性、碎片化和不规则UV岛方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法存在耗时、碎片化、缺乏语义性和不规则UV岛等问题，限制了实际应用。艺术家风格的UV映射需要满足重叠自由、最小扭曲等基本标准，同时保持清晰边界、高效空间利用和语义一致性。

Method: ArtUV模拟专业UV映射过程，分为两个阶段：1）使用SeamGPT进行语义缝线预测；2）基于优化方法的粗糙UV通过自编码器精炼成艺术家风格UV图。该方法确保语义一致性和拓扑结构保持。

Conclusion: ArtUV提供了一个多功能解决方案，能够无缝集成到专业工作流程中，生成的UV图可直接用于2D编辑，满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自回归生成和偏好优化，有效解决了网格接缝放置中的关键挑战，为3D表面参数化提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

TL;DR: CHARM是一个用于动漫发型建模的参数化表示和生成框架，通过控制点参数化和自回归生成模型解决传统方法对动漫风格头发建模的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统头发建模方法主要针对真实头发，使用基于发丝或体积的表示，但动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构化的几何特征，现有技术难以有效处理。现有方法依赖密集网格建模或手工样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合大规模学习。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了表达力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持艺术家友好的设计和基于学习的生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

TL;DR: BlockFUL是一个用于联邦学习中遗忘功能的双链区块链框架，通过并行和顺序两种遗忘范式，结合梯度上升和重训练方法，有效降低数据依赖性和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的模型遗忘面临挑战，特别是在使用区块链确保完整性和可追溯性时，编辑多个互连的区块链记录和更新继承模型的过程变得复杂。

Method: 提出BlockFUL框架，采用双链结构（实时链和归档链），引入并行和顺序两种遗忘范式，通过梯度上升和重训练方法实现高效遗忘。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上使用AlexNet、ResNet18和MobileNetV2模型的实验表明，该方法能有效降低数据依赖性和操作开销。

Conclusion: BlockFUL框架通过创新的双链结构和遗忘方法，显著提升了联邦学习中继承模型的遗忘性能。

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种条件参数化的全卷积U-Net替代模型，用于加速液态金属脱合金相场模拟，能够在空间和时间上大幅超越训练窗口进行泛化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 液态金属脱合金的相场模型能够解析丰富的微观结构动力学，但对于大尺度域或长时间尺度计算变得不可行，需要开发高效的替代模型。

Method: 设计了集成卷积自注意力和物理感知填充的U-Net架构，通过参数条件化实现可变时间步跳过和适应不同合金系统，利用卷积的平移不变性进行长时间尺度外推。

Result: 替代模型准确再现了关键LMD物理过程，训练区域内相对误差通常低于5%，外推到更大域和更长时间时误差低于10%，计算加速高达16,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法将数周的模拟时间缩短至秒级，标志着向可扩展、高保真LMD相场模型外推迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

TL;DR: RadAgents是一个用于胸部X光片解读的多智能体框架，通过结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胸部X光片解读方法存在三个主要问题：推理过程缺乏临床可解释性和指南对齐性；多模态证据融合不足，产生仅基于文本的推理；系统缺乏检测和解决工具间不一致性的机制。

Method: 提出RadAgents多智能体框架，结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，集成基础化和多模态检索增强技术来验证和解决上下文冲突。

Result: 该方法产生了更可靠、透明且符合临床实践的输出结果。

Conclusion: RadAgents框架通过多智能体协作和验证机制，显著提升了胸部X光片解读的临床适用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

Motivation: 现有的隐式表面重建方法如NeuS需要大量多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发能够从单张图像快速重建神经表面的轻量级方法。

Method: FINS整合了多分辨率哈希网格编码器与轻量级几何和颜色头，使用近似二阶优化器进行高效训练。利用预训练基础模型从单张RGB图像估计几何信息。

Conclusion: FINS为机器人表面跟随任务提供了有效的解决方案，并在多个基准数据集上展示了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在训练超网方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源，无法满足机器人边缘设备的资源限制需求。

Method: 提出子网互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样子网进行相互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；使用三种机器人边缘硬件数据训练延迟预测器；进行统一的多目标进化搜索。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%到81.4%的top-1准确率；在机器人边缘硬件上显著降低推理延迟；在检测和分割任务中，相比基于MobileNetv3的方法，在所有三种硬件类型上都减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了神经架构搜索在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，能够有效平衡模型精度和硬件延迟，适用于机器人边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频演示学习为机器人操作提供可扩展的替代方案，但面临机器人本体差异和关节可行性约束的挑战。

Method: 将演示视为物体中心指导，平衡三个目标：选择可行抓取姿态、生成与演示一致的物体轨迹、确保机器人运动学下的无碰撞执行。扩展流匹配到SE(3)进行物体轨迹概率建模，避免模式崩溃。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: JFTO框架通过统一的优化目标成功解决了从视频演示学习机器人操作的关键挑战，实现了密度感知的模仿学习。

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在足式机器人导航中存在快速运动不稳定、标定要求高、传感器漂移等问题，且缺乏语义推理能力，无法支持任务驱动的探索。

Method: 采用纯视觉导航框架，包含分层视觉语言感知模块（融合场景级上下文和对象级线索）和语义概率拓扑地图，结合LLM全局推理和视觉局部规划，与强化学习运动控制器集成。

Result: 仿真和真实环境实验显示在语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率方面均有显著提升，消融实验验证了分层感知和精细局部规划的必要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动导航的新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心建图转向语义驱动决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM系统在低纹理环境和挑战性视觉条件下性能较差，而基于神经网络的前馈点云图回归方法虽然能恢复高质量3D场景几何，但往往丢弃了多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出Sim(3)视觉对齐约束，将其集成到通用度量尺度SE(3)因子图中，采用层次化因子图设计，支持实时滑动窗口优化和具有激进闭环的全局优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试和自收集数据集上的评估表明，相比现有视觉中心的多传感器SLAM系统，在精度和鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架有效结合了前馈点云图回归和多传感器融合的优势，实现了实时姿态跟踪、度量尺度结构感知和全局一致的地图构建，代码将开源以支持可复现性研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中表现出强大的序列建模能力，但其性能受到空间-时间不对齐的限制，即规划器必须基于过去的感知数据来预测未来动作，这造成了世界观不一致的问题。

Method: 1. 提出TISA模块学习将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心框架中；2. 使用运动学动作预测头（加速度和偏航率）确保物理可行的轨迹；3. 引入基于DPO的多目标后训练阶段，超越纯模仿学习。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上达到了89.8 PDMS的最先进性能，在自回归模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: TISA模块有效解决了自回归模型的空间-时间不对齐问题，结合运动学约束和多目标优化，显著提升了自动驾驶端到端规划的性能上限。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Motivation: 现有的帧到帧生成方法存在计算冗余和忽视关键语义转换的问题，限制了机器人世界模型在实时控制等实际应用中的部署。

Method: KeyWorld首先通过简化机器人运动轨迹识别关键帧，然后训练DiT模型从文本任务描述生成这些关键帧，最后使用轻量级插值器重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld相比基线实现了5.68倍的加速，并在复杂任务上显著提高了生成视频的物理有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制等需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Motivation: 传统机器人教学需要物理演示（遥操作或动觉教学），数据收集繁琐且难以扩展。需要一种更便捷的替代方案来教导机器人行为。

Method: CrossInstruct框架将跨模态指令作为示例输入基础视觉语言模型，通过迭代查询小模型合成2D视图运动，融合为3D轨迹分布，并结合强化学习微调策略。

Result: 在基准仿真任务和真实硬件上验证了有效性，无需额外微调即可产生可执行行为，并为强化学习提供了良好的初始化策略。

Conclusion: CrossInstruct提供了一种无需物理演示的机器人教学新范式，能够泛化到有限指令示例之外的环境，并通过强化学习实现精细任务完成。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏执行人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向）的能力，导致在大型环境中导航效率低下。

Method: 设计基于导航地标的紧凑输入输出抽象，让视觉语言模型专注于语言理解和推理，集成人类导航技能。

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估表明，ReasonNav能够成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过集成人类导航行为和视觉语言模型的推理能力，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.
