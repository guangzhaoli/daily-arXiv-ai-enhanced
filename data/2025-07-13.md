### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE）来解决多模态实体链接中的提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，导致语义匹配不足。

Method: MMoE包含描述感知提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块和两级专家混合模块。

Result: 实验表明MMoE在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择模态内容有效提升了多模态实体链接的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入学习领域不变特征，在四个基准测试中达到最新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督域适应（UDA）在语义分割中标注困难，现有方法未充分利用文本的领域无关特性。

Method: 通过LLM生成领域描述，结合冻结的CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，设计CoPT损失学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最新性能。

Conclusion: CoPT利用文本嵌入提升了UDA分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Recall的对抗性框架，用于测试图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）在去学习技术中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管去学习技术（MU）被提出以解决图像生成模型可能产生的有害或侵权内容，但其在多模态对抗输入下的鲁棒性和有效性尚未充分研究。

Method: Recall通过优化对抗性图像提示，利用扩散模型的多模态条件能力，测试现有去学习方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前去学习机制的关键漏洞，强调了开发更鲁棒解决方案的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了可解释人工智能（XAI）在生物医学图像分析中的应用，填补了现有研究在模态感知、多模态和视觉语言范式方面的不足，并提供了实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI在生物医学图像分析中日益重要，但现有综述缺乏对模态感知和多模态学习的关注，且实用指导有限。

Method: 通过系统分类XAI方法，分析其原理、优势和局限性，并提出以模态为中心的分类法，探讨多模态学习和视觉语言模型的作用。

Result: 提出了一种模态分类法，总结了评估指标和开源框架，并讨论了当前挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 该研究为生物医学图像分析中可解释深度学习的发展提供了全面且及时的基础。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象，提出模态冲突是导致幻觉的原因，并构建了MMMC数据集和三种方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态输入中的模态冲突如何导致MLLMs产生幻觉，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的方法，构建MMMC数据集进行实验。

Result: 强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法表现稳定。

Conclusion: 揭示了模态冲突对MLLMs幻觉的影响，为模型鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [6] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在GNSS不可用环境下利用YOLOv8模型和特征匹配技术进行海上目标船只识别与定位的方法，并在MBZIRC2023竞赛中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的环境中，自主海上监视和目标船只识别对搜索救援和威胁检测等应用至关重要。

Method: 使用YOLOv8模型检测船只，结合特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析识别目标船只，并通过几何原理定位目标。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中验证了方法的可行性，并评估了视角对检测精度和定位准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下能有效识别和定位目标船只，为自主海上监视提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [7] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp是一种基于对比学习的息肉分割网络，通过自监督策略提升特征提取能力，无需额外标注数据，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖额外标注数据或任务相似性，限制了泛化能力，因此提出CL-Polyp以解决这些问题。

Method: 采用对比学习增强编码器特征提取能力，引入MASPP模块和CA模块优化多尺度特征融合和边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU指标在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB上分别提升0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在临床息肉分割任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

### [8] [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157)
*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过EEG信号与多级语义描述对齐的方法，实现了从脑电信号到图像生成的先进视觉解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号在空间细节上的局限性阻碍了图像重建，因此需要一种新的方法来绕过直接EEG到图像的生成。

Method: 使用基于transformer的EEG编码器，通过对比学习将脑电活动与多级语义描述对齐，并利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码，并展示了与已知神经认知通路的可解释对齐。

Conclusion: 通过结构化语义中介，实现了从EEG信号中生成与认知对齐的视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前视频生成模型的局限性，尤其是长视频生成中的一致性和多样性问题，并提出了新的分类法和比较表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在生成长视频时难以保持角色一致性和场景布局，且多主题长视频的问题尤为突出。

Method: 通过研究32篇视频生成论文，识别关键架构组件和训练策略，并构建新的分类法。

Result: 提出了一个全面的分类法和比较表，帮助理解不同方法的架构设计和性能特点。

Conclusion: 论文为长视频生成领域提供了系统性的分析和分类，有助于未来研究的改进和优化。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [10] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSCI利用颜色信息（前景和背景）作为轻量级、无标注的代理，解决衣物变化重识别中的外观偏差问题，通过S2A自注意力机制分离颜色与身份特征，在多个数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物变化重识别（CC-ReID）需要识别不同衣物下的同一人，现有方法依赖额外模型或标注，资源消耗大。本文探索颜色信息作为轻量级替代方案。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，直接利用RGB图像中的颜色信息，通过S2A自注意力机制分离颜色与身份特征，避免信息泄露。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上，图像和视频重识别性能显著提升（如LTCC提升2.9%，PRCC提升5.0%），无需额外监督。

Conclusion: 颜色信息是解决CC-ReID外观偏差的高效低成本方案，CSCI方法在无标注情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VFX制作中掩码生成慢且资源密集的问题。

Method: 结合文本提示的灵活对象检测、逐帧图像分割和鲁棒视频跟踪，确保时间一致性。

Result: 减少人工操作，加速初步合成，提供全面的分割数据。

Conclusion: 该流程被艺术家快速采用，显著提升了VFX生产效率。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [12] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，用于解决活动生物特征识别中的身份与运动动态纠缠问题，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统身份识别在多样化活动中面临身份线索与运动动态和外观变化纠缠的挑战，现有方法依赖额外视觉数据但提取不准确。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，通过结构化文本指导解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征，避免依赖额外视觉数据。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中取得最优性能，并在传统视频识别基准中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架通过语言指导有效解耦特征，提升了活动生物特征识别的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个用于评估多语言视觉问答任务中大型多模态模型（LMMs）性能的基准测试，涵盖11种语言和5种社会属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在多语言覆盖上存在不足，导致输出偏见和不公平，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含6,875个图像-文本对的数据集，使用Bias、Answer Relevancy和Faithfulness三个指标评估模型。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）整体表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在某些方面表现优异，Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言评估的重要性，并发布了基准测试和代码以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型视觉语言模型是否真正进行视觉推理，还是依赖表面模式和数据集偏差。

Method: 构建包含5500个弱监督QA和900个人工标注示例的基准，评估15个模型在四个维度上的表现。

Result: 揭示了当前视觉推理模型在推理有效性、视觉证据对齐和自纠正能力方面的局限性。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进视觉推理模型提供了重要工具和分析框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

### [15] [ADIEE: Automatic Dataset Creation and Scorer for Instruction-Guided Image Editing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07317)
*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE提出了一种自动化数据集创建方法，用于训练评分模型以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著提升了开源VLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源VLM在指令引导图像编辑评估中表现不佳，且缺乏公开训练数据集，需要透明且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过ADIEE生成大规模数据集（100K样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型以输出评分。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中优于开源VLM和Gemini-Pro 1.5，显著提升了与人类评分的相关性及比较准确性。

Conclusion: ADIEE及其评分模型为指令引导图像编辑提供了高效、透明的自动化评估工具，并可应用于模型优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对比强化学习方法，通过训练模型区分连贯图像序列和无关图像，提升了视觉叙事系统中角色和对象的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉叙事系统在跨帧识别角色和对象时表现不佳，导致不一致的引用和幻觉。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展数据集并引入双组件奖励函数，优化Qwen Storyteller模型。

Result: 模型在多个指标上显著提升，如grounding mAP提高14.8%，F1提高17.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体一致性和故事连贯性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出卓越的泛化能力，适应不同场景语义/尺度和深度稀疏性/模式。

Conclusion: PacGDC通过伪几何合成显著提升深度补全的泛化性，为下游任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Result: 在挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，分析了自适应性与对应性的权衡。

Conclusion: 新方法在表面表示精度和对应性指标上优于现有方法，提升了复杂解剖结构的建模能力。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Result: 在五个PES基准测试中表现优异，计算开销小，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种轻量级即插即用模块，显著提升了精确事件检测的性能。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Result: 通过新数据集DeformingThings4D-skl和实验验证，模型在跨类别动物运动转移中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架有效保留了动物习惯行为，为动画和虚拟现实应用提供了更真实的运动转移解决方案。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Motivation: 无约束照片集合易于获取但存在光照不一致和瞬态遮挡问题，现有方法无法有效解决。

Method: 通过多维特征嵌入和3D高斯相似性计算实现交互式分割，引入Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter平滑异常高斯。

Result: 实验表明Seg-Wild在分割和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景分割提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Motivation: 现有方法需要多阶段和复杂流程来补全缺失部分并合成新视角，忽略了跨视角依赖且存储和计算冗余。

Method: 采用输入级和特征级掩码微调，实现端到端模型，提升新视角合成和非模态补全能力。

Result: 在遮挡任务中，PSNR提升3.9，Volume IoU提升0.28，重建时间减少95%。

Conclusion: EscherNet++在小数据集和批量下实现最优结果，并适用于真实场景的遮挡重建。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Motivation: 大规模预训练多模态模型（LMMs）在微调时计算成本高，需要更高效的模态对齐方法。

Method: 利用中间层的时间提示和基于相似性的提示交互，促进模态间信息交换。

Result: 在UPMC-Food101和SNLI-VE数据集上表现优异，在MM-IMDB上表现相当，同时减少计算资源和参数。

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，适用于文本-图像分类任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and

limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks

we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality

diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning

demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art

Conclusion: DSANet有效解决了超声视频分割中的噪声问题，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that

Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon

### [31] [Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464)
*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的盲人脸图像恢复框架，通过局部统计面部特征变换（SFFT）和退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，显著提升了恶劣天气条件下的恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的人脸识别系统性能下降，现有方法缺乏专门针对天气退化的模块，导致纹理和结构失真。

Method: 结合局部SFFT和DAFE模块，SFFT通过对齐低质量与高质量区域的局部统计分布增强结构，DAFE通过编码器表示对齐实现自适应恢复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和重建面部结构方面优于现有GAN和扩散模型方法。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块有效提升了恶劣天气下的人脸恢复质量，具有更高的结构保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成框架TUEs，用于防止个人视频数据被未经授权用于深度跟踪器训练，解决了现有方法在视频数据隐私保护中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用于视觉目标跟踪（VOT）训练，但视频数据隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成时间不可学习示例（TUEs）的框架，通过高效计算适用于大规模视频数据集，并引入时间对比损失以增强效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面达到最先进性能，具有强大的跨VOT模型、数据集和时间匹配任务的迁移性。

Conclusion: TUEs框架有效防止了视频数据被未经授权利用，为视频数据隐私保护提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Result: OMA包含48万条道路和26万条车道路径，并提供了评估指标。

Conclusion: OMA提升了自动驾驶车辆的规划能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

TL;DR: DMPO是一种通过最小化反向KL散度来对齐扩散模型的新方法，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法通常陷入次优均值寻求优化，需要更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 提出DMPO方法，通过最小化反向KL散度对齐扩散模型。

Result: DMPO在人类评估和自动指标上均优于现有技术，PickScore提升64.6%。

Conclusion: DMPO为偏好对齐提供了稳健且优雅的路径，连接理论与实际性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

### [35] [GGMotion: Group Graph Dynamics-Kinematics Networks for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07515)
*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion提出了一种基于组图动力学-运动学网络的方法，通过分组建模人体拓扑结构，更好地利用动力学和运动学先验，显著提升了运动预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人体姿态表示为抽象图结构，忽略了关节之间的内在物理依赖关系，导致学习困难且容易生成不真实的运动。

Method: GGMotion通过组图网络建模人体拓扑结构，利用径向场捕捉时空依赖关系，并通过组内和组间交互模块在不同尺度上捕获关节依赖关系。结合等变多层感知机（MLP）和辅助损失函数提升物理合理性。

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW三个标准基准测试中，GGMotion在短期运动预测任务中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过分组建模和物理先验的引入，有效提升了运动预测的准确性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景的4D对象分割研究不足，主要原因是缺乏大规模、精确标注的多视角视频数据集。

Method: 收集了17个场景的多视角视频数据，提供7830张RGB图像及其分割掩码，涵盖73类459个实例。

Result: MUVOD数据集支持多视角视频分割方法的评估，并提出了3D对象分割的新基准。

Conclusion: MUVOD数据集为动态场景分割研究提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Motivation: 现有方法在隐式变形场中依赖神经网络的归纳偏置，可能导致空间一致性不足；显式方法如线性混合蒙皮则依赖启发式节点初始化。此外，隐式表示在稀疏时间信号插值方面的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 采用基于样条的轨迹表示，引入低秩时变空间编码来建模节点特性，取代传统的耦合时空技术。

Result: 在稀疏输入拟合连续场的时间插值中表现优异，动态场景重建质量与现有方法相当，同时提高了运动一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式控制节点数量和低秩编码，有效解决了空间一致性和时间插值问题，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上验证，MAPEX性能优于全监督训练和现有遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: MAPEX通过多模态专家混合和模态感知剪枝，有效解决了模态不匹配问题，提升了遥感任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is
available at https://github.com/HSG-AIML/MAPEX.

*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在抽象推理任务中的线性可分性瓶颈，并提出了一种新的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在抽象推理任务中表现受限，主要原因是其视觉嵌入的线性可分性不足，但问题根源在于语言模型的推理路径而非感知能力。

Method: 通过引入线性可分性天花板（LSC）指标，分析VLMs的视觉嵌入性能，并使用后置调优（postfix tuning）作为方法控制。

Result: 研究发现，语义概念任务可以通过激活现有路径解决，而复杂关系推理需要调整核心模型权重；改进表示质量可能导致模型在新提示格式下失败。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健推理的关键在于针对性对齐，而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光环境下性能显著下降，主要由于图像质量退化（如低对比度、噪声和颜色失真）和弱监督的固有限制，导致不可靠的类激活图和语义模糊的伪标签。

Method: 提出DGKD-WLSS框架，通过扩散引导知识蒸馏（DGKD）对齐正常光和低光特征，并通过深度引导特征融合（DGF2）整合深度图作为光照不变的几何先验。

Result: 实验证明DGKD-WLSS在低光条件下的弱监督语义分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS通过结合DGKD和DGF2，有效解决了低光环境下的语义分割问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有洪水监测产品在空间细节和覆盖范围之间存在权衡，且常忽略洪水深度信息，HOTA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: HOTA采用分层重叠平铺聚合策略，结合SegFormer模型和DEM差分方法，实现2D洪水掩膜和深度估计。

Result: 在澳大利亚Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA将IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能生成准确的大范围3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object

refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term

improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,

TL;DR: LOSC方法通过整合图像语义标签并训练3D网络，显著提升了零样本开放词汇语义和全景分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用基于图像的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在驾驶场景中对激光雷达扫描进行开放词汇分割，解决传统方法中标签噪声和稀疏性问题。

Method: 通过整合标签以增强时空一致性和对图像级增强的鲁棒性，并基于这些优化标签训练3D网络。

Result: LOSC方法在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI数据集上显著超越了现有零样本开放词汇语义和全景分割的最先进方法。

Conclusion: LOSC是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升激光雷达扫描的开放词汇分割性能。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench是一个多模态基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在空间可视化任务中的表现，揭示了模型在该领域的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了包含12个任务、1,180个问题的多模态基准测试SpatialViz-Bench，评估了33个先进MLLM。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在与人类直觉不符的感知困难、2D到3D性能骤降等问题。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了领域空白，显示当前MLLM在空间可视化任务中仍有不足。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言模型中可靠的不确定性量化和失败预测的开放性问题。

Method: 使用二元分类器训练不确定性预测器，通过加权二元交叉熵损失区分正确与错误预测，无需依赖损失预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，适用于后处理场景。

Conclusion: ViLU的架构和训练方法在不确定性量化中起关键作用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于领域特异性或对高级文本指导的过度依赖，导致运动细节丢失和重建不真实。

Method: 采用语义感知的稀疏运动采样管道，结合轨迹对齐的损失约束，实现低码率下的高效视频编码。

Result: 在超低码率条件下优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Motivation: 现有FER模型存在年龄偏见，尤其是对老年人，影响公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用XAI技术分析偏见，提出多任务学习、多模态输入和年龄加权损失三种策略。

Result: 模型在老年人群体中的识别准确率显著提升，尤其是易错表情。

Conclusion: 年龄偏见可通过简单训练调整缓解，近似人口统计标签对提升公平性有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Result: 在MitoDataset上，药物识别和MoA识别的mAP分别提升51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合显著提升了药物作用机制的研究效果。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Conclusion: ARNet为儿科正畸提供了一种高效的AI辅助诊断工具，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Conclusion: AU-expression知识的整合和损失函数设计能有效提升DFER效果，并解决数据标签不平衡问题。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Method: 将多模态CoT推理重新定义为KL约束的奖励最大化问题，提出RED解码策略，结合视觉和理由信息。

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED是一种实用且有效的方法，提升了LVLMs中CoT推理的忠实性和准确性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba通过改进的扫描策略和高质量数据集，显著提升了水下单目深度估计的精度。

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效资源分配和自适应模糊恢复策略，显著提升了局部运动模糊去除的性能和效率。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as

TL;DR: 提出了一种高频率双流脉冲神经网络（SNN），在THU EACT-50数据集上比之前工作提高了2%的准确率，用于早期人类活动识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全和人机交互至关重要，事件视觉传感器因其高时间分辨率和低延迟适合此需求，但现有方法限制了早期预测能力。

Method: 采用高频率双流SNN处理事件数据，并在早期事件识别框架中进行基准测试。

Result: 在THU EACT-50数据集上，SNN的最终准确率提高了2%，并在实时任务中展示了其应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在早期识别任务中表现出色，为实时人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

TL;DR: SDST是一种稀疏-密集侧调谐架构，用于视频时间定位，通过参考可变形自注意力机制提升性能，显著减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖冻结预训练模型的最终层特征，适应性差；侧调谐方法虽有效但忽视稀疏性。

Method: 提出SDST架构和参考可变形自注意力机制，首次集成InternVideo2到侧调谐框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA或接近SOTA性能，参数减少73%。

Conclusion: SDST显著提升性能并减少参数，为视频时间定位提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

TL;DR: X-RAFT模型通过改进RAFT光流模型，实现了在荧光和反射模式下高光谱图像的密集跨模态对应，显著提高了神经外科手术中的荧光定量测量准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将高光谱成像整合到荧光引导的神经外科手术中，可以提供实时的定量荧光测量，从而改善手术决策。然而，荧光（蓝光）和反射（白光）模式下的图像需要在动态手术环境中顺序采集，因此需要找到两种不同光照条件下的高光谱图像之间的密集跨模态对应关系。

Method: 提出了X-RAFT模型，这是一种改进的RAFT光流模型，专为跨模态输入设计。方法包括为每种模态使用独立的图像编码器，并通过流循环一致性在神经外科高光谱数据上进行自监督微调。

Result: 与基线方法相比，X-RAFT在评估指标上减少了36.6%的误差，与现有的跨模态光流方法（CrossRAFT）相比减少了27.83%的误差。

Conclusion: X-RAFT模型在荧光引导的神经外科手术中表现出色，显著提升了跨模态高光谱图像对应的准确性，为手术决策提供了更可靠的定量荧光数据。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增材制造中的几何误差会影响部件性能，传统DVC方法因缺乏参考变形场和大数据量而难以精确配准。

Method: 采用动态分块处理策略的深度学习模型，引入Binary Difference Map评估配准精度。

Result: Dice Score和体素匹配率分别提高了9.2%和9.9%，交互时间从几天缩短到几分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为闭环增材制造提供了可靠高效的配准基础，具有工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

TL;DR: SCOOTER是一个开源框架，用于评估无限制对抗攻击的不可感知性，提供统计支持的工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击防御方法无法应对无限制攻击，且缺乏统计显著的人类评估方法。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括众包研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 发现现有攻击方法无法生成不可感知的图像，且人类与模型感知不一致。

Conclusion: SCOOTER为无限制对抗攻击评估提供了标准化工具，揭示了人类与自动视觉系统的感知差异。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 理解并改进在数据集偏移下的校准性能，为实践者提供稳健校准的指导。

Method: 比较了多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个自然偏移和分类任务中进行实验。

Result: 发现熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳，后处理校准方法在少量OOD数据下表现稳健，新校准方法改进有限，且校准改进常以ID校准下降为代价。

Conclusion: 基础模型微调和集成是最有效的校准方法，结合后处理校准可显著提升校准稳健性。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，因为下游数据集差异较大。

Method: ViaPT为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留关键信息。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过平衡数据集级和实例级知识，成为视觉提示调优的新范式。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Conclusion: SyP通过动态和协同提示策略有效解决了多模态缺失问题，展示了卓越的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

Motivation: 现有无标记方法多依赖深度学习，但基于Transformer的架构在此领域尚未探索，尽管其在轨迹预测中表现优异。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描数据训练多患者模型，保留1名患者评估；患者特定模型仅使用目标患者数据。评估指标为ADE和FDE。

Result: 患者特定模型在T1数据上表现更优，但多患者模型对分次间解剖变化更具鲁棒性，且在T2数据上表现相当。

Conclusion: 患者特定模型精度更高，但多患者模型无需重新训练即可提供稳健性能，适合临床时间受限场景。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Conclusion: SimCIS通过简单而有效的方法解决了类增量图像分割中的关键问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made

performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: THUNDER是一个用于数字病理学基础模型的快速、易用、动态的基准测试工具，支持多种任务和模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学领域近期涌现大量基础模型，需通过基准测试评估其性能、差异及不确定性。

Method: 开发THUNDER基准测试工具，对23种基础模型在16个数据集上进行多任务比较和特征分析。

Result: THUNDER支持高效比较，提供模型特征空间、鲁棒性和不确定性评估。

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学领域提供了可靠的模型评估工具，促进研究进展。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法在复杂场景中计算量大且易产生不真实伪影，SLURPP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合预训练潜在扩散模型和显式场景分解，并设计基于物理的水下图像合成流程生成训练数据。

Result: SLURPP比现有方法快200倍，PSNR提升约3 dB，并在真实数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: SLURPP通过新颖架构和合成数据生成，实现了高效且高质量的水下图像恢复。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在医学诊断中常生成与医学知识不一致的响应，而RAG虽能提升准确性，但存在检索不足或过度检索的问题。

Method: 提出MIRA框架，包含校准的重新思考与重排模块和医学RAG框架，结合图像嵌入与知识库，优化检索与推理。

Result: 在公开医学VQA和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提升事实准确性和性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MIRA有效解决了MLLMs在医学诊断中的事实不一致问题，为AI辅助诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Motivation: 现代导航系统需要精确的位置估计，而VSLAM依赖可靠的特征点提取，但现有方法计算量大，难以在资源受限平台上高效运行。

Method: 采用量化SuperPoint CNN，结合Brevitas库和FINN框架进行模型量化和硬件优化，在FPGA SoC平台上实现。

Result: 在AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+平台上实现54 fps处理640x480像素图像，性能优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 通过量化技术和硬件优化，实现了高效的特征点检测，适用于资源受限的视觉里程计任务。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Motivation: 现有方法在隐私和实时适应性方面存在限制，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 利用生理学先验知识，提出基于一致性和不一致性的自监督框架CiCi，并结合梯度动态控制机制。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在实时自监督适应中表现优异，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CiCi框架在无需源数据的情况下，实现了最先进的实时自适应性能。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Conclusion: 该算法解决了小鼠个体识别的挑战，为疾病研究和治疗评估提供了更动态的数据支持。

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型在原始视频数据训练下难以捕捉几何感知结构，需弥补其与3D物理世界的差距。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和3D一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing有效提升了视频扩散模型的几何感知能力。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Method: 通过高效的数据收集流程，构建了包含1.4k场景和10k问答对的数据集，基于ScanNet、Matterport3D和ARKitScenes。

Result: 现有MLLMs在复杂时空推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是在在线设置下，随着探索范围扩大和记忆增长，准确性下降。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了在线具身推理的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了数据集和基准测试资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在绑定问题上的局限性，探索数据属性对其性能的影响。

Method: 使用合成数据集，分析数据属性（如属性密度、描述完整性和显著性偏差）对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 发现数据属性是影响CLIP绑定性能的关键，而非批量大小或硬负样本。

Conclusion: 仅当数据具备特定属性时，CLIP才能实现近乎完美的绑定能力。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

<details>

Motivation: 视频大语言模型（LLMs）在处理大量时空令牌时面临计算复杂度二次增长的问题，现有方法未能充分利用视频数据的局部冗余性。

Method: STTM通过从粗到细的搜索将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中，STTM表现优于现有令牌减少方法，实现了2倍至3倍的加速，且准确率下降极小。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效且无需训练的视频令牌合并方法，适用于不同查询场景，并支持KV缓存重用。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Motivation: 解决少样本学习中源数据与查询数据分布不一致的问题，利用草图作为无源替代方案。

Method: 采用原型设置，结合基于网格的定位器和原型域适应。

Result: 通过大量实验，证明了在新关键点和类别上的少样本收敛成功。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了草图驱动的少样本关键点检测问题。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: KARL是一种基于Kolmogorov复杂性原理的单次自适应图像标记器，通过单次前向传播预测图像所需的标记数量，并在达到近似KC时停止。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统通常使用固定长度的表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂性或熟悉度变化。KARL旨在通过自适应标记化方法解决这一问题。

Method: KARL采用单次前向传播预测标记数量，训练过程类似于倒置强化学习范式，根据重建质量条件预测标记停止。

Result: KARL在单次操作中性能与现有自适应标记器相当，并提供了关于编码器/解码器大小、连续与离散标记化等的扩展规律。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像标记化与算法信息理论的类比，其预测的图像复杂性与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Conclusion: NickName在HD图像处理中展现了优越的重建能力，为高保真任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on

Motivation: 现有模型如OpenAI-o3在视觉基础推理方面表现突出，但缺乏全面评估这些能力的基准。

Method: 提出了TreeBench基准，基于三个原则构建：聚焦视觉感知、追踪证据和二阶推理。同时，提出了TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习监督定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench包含405个具有挑战性的视觉问答对，先进模型准确率不足60%。TreeVGR在多个基准上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 追踪证据是提升视觉基础推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Motivation: 探讨训练数据中概念组合对组合泛化能力的影响，尤其是常见对象在不常见配对中的表现。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）量化词共现频率，通过合成和编辑自然图像验证PMI与模型准确性的关系。

Result: PMI与CLIP和LMMs的准确性显著相关（r=0.97至0.62），表明概念组合影响模型表现。

Conclusion: 需开发新算法和架构以提升多模态模型的组合泛化能力，避免数据规模的组合爆炸。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过描述无关和多提示加权，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究冰层厚度及其变异性对监测积雪、评估冰动态和减少气候模型不确定性至关重要。

Conclusion: ST-GRIT通过自注意力机制和图神经网络结合，有效处理噪声、避免过平滑，并能捕捉长程依赖关系。

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务目标差异可能导致负迁移，现有预训练Transformer的固定结构和容量限制了适应性。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中动态识别梯度冲突并自适应调整，避免直接复制网络参数。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL能显著提升多任务性能，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的MTL模型提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Motivation: 联邦类增量学习中，数据重放方法因类不平衡问题（包括重放缓冲区内的不平衡和新旧类之间的不平衡）而性能受限。

Method: FedCBDR包含两个关键模块：1) 全局视角数据重放模块，通过隐私保护方式重构先前任务的全局表示，指导类感知和重要性敏感的采样策略；2) 任务感知温度缩放模块，根据任务动态自适应调整类级和实例级的温度。

Result: 实验表明，FedCBDR在异构数据分布下实现了类平衡采样，并在任务不平衡情况下提升了泛化能力，Top-1准确率比六种先进方法提高了2%-15%。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过全局协调和自适应温度调整，有效解决了联邦类增量学习中的类不平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX is a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns adversaries to different classes based on their vulnerability, improving fairness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, leading to unfair robustness disparities between strong and weak classes. TRIX aims to address this by tailoring adversaries to each class's needs.

Method: TRIX adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, incorporating per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments.

Result: TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on clean and adversarial data, reduces inter-class robustness disparities, and maintains overall accuracy.

Conclusion: TRIX represents a practical advancement toward fair and effective adversarial defense by addressing class-wise vulnerability disparities.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测跨域任务关系来同步多任务处理，结合传统TTT协议进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T通过同步多任务处理，有效提升了测试时训练在多任务场景下的性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.

Result: 实验显示，SD-GS模型大小平均减少60%，FPS提升100%，同时保持或超越视觉质量。

Conclusion: SD-GS在计算效率和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂动态场景重建。

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

Conclusion: RTR-GS框架成功解决了反射物体渲染的挑战，为逆渲染和重光照提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Method: 研究使用了两种网络架构（D-CNN和VQ-VAE）和不同压缩率，对砂岩样本的XCT数据进行压缩和恢复，并引入了一种对边缘保护敏感的指标。

Result: 不同架构和压缩率对数据恢复质量有显著影响，需根据后续分析需求选择合适的方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为科学家选择数据存储和分析策略提供了参考。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

TL;DR: GridTD是一种无监督连续表示框架，用于压缩成像重建，结合多分辨率网格编码和张量分解，实现高效高维图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督表示方法在表示能力和效率之间难以平衡，GridTD旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，GridTD在多种压缩成像任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GridTD是一种多功能且先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Result: 框架能够处理不完整数据，并通过多模态数据融合提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ccRCC复发预测提供了更全面的解决方案，有望改善临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管病理对认知衰退和神经系统疾病有重要影响，但现有评估方法缺乏标准化定量验证，且难以检测细微血管变化。

Method: ArteryX采用基于血管融合网络的标记方法，结合半监督学习，实现了高效且准确的血管特征提取。

Conclusion: ArteryX有望成为临床工作流程中的标准化工具，促进脑血管病理的早期检测和跨队列比较。

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线图像分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但高质量标注数据获取困难，尤其是腕骨分割因多块小腕骨重叠而更具挑战性。

Method: 通过从CT体积生成大量模拟X射线图像及其对应的10个骨标签，训练深度学习模型，用于真实X射线图像的腕骨分割。

Result: 在模拟数据集上Dice分数为0.80至0.92，真实X射线图像的定性分析也显示模型性能优越。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据标注问题，模型和模拟代码将公开供研究使用。

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 预训练的视觉-语言特征可有效适应少样本医学影像任务，为常见和罕见疾病诊断提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this
research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not
been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at

Result: IDEAL-IO在多种成像系统中验证，内存和运行时间减少6倍，设计更优。

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO为实际成像系统设计提供了高效、可扩展的信息论优化策略。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Motivation: 荧光显微镜图像中的曲线结构分割在噪声和密集网络中具有挑战性，现有方法在低对比度条件下性能下降。

Method: 开发了ASE_Res_UNet，结合残差块和自适应SE注意力机制，提升标准U-Net的性能。

Result: ASE_Res_UNet在合成和真实图像中均表现优异，尤其在噪声和低强度结构检测上。

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet在疾病诊断和治疗中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和物联网环境中，计算资源随时间变化，需要动态架构来适应。现有层丢弃方法在层选择模式或架构修改方面存在局限性。

Method: 通过输入特征和轻量级层选择网络，确定最佳处理层组合，实现动态调整。

Conclusion: 输入驱动的层丢弃方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为动态模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.
