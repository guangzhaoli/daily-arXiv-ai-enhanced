### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的测试时增强方法CI-TTA，通过弹性变形生成同一类别的多个图像变体，并通过置信度过滤聚合预测，提升域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降，现有域泛化方法大多依赖多域训练或计算密集的测试时适应，需要更轻量有效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了类别不变的测试时增强技术，使用弹性和网格变形生成输入图像的多个变体，通过置信度引导的过滤方案聚合预测，移除不可靠输出。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home数据集上的广泛实验显示，该方法在不同域泛化算法和骨干网络上均取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: CI-TTA方法具有有效性和通用性，为域泛化问题提供了一种轻量级且互补的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken是首个统一视觉分词器，能够在图像、视频和3D资产上同时实现高保真重建和语义理解，统一了多种视觉模态和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器要么专注于重建任务，要么专注于理解任务，且通常只针对单一模态。需要一种能够统一处理多种视觉输入并同时支持重建和理解任务的框架。

Method: 采用纯transformer架构，使用4D旋转位置编码处理任意分辨率和时长的视觉输入。引入无对抗训练目标，结合感知损失和Gram矩阵损失，采用渐进式训练课程从单图像扩展到视频和3D，支持连续和离散潜在token。

Result: 在图像上达到0.21 rFID和82.2% ImageNet准确率；视频上达到3.01 rFVD和32.6% MSRVTT检索率；3D上达到28.19 PSNR和90.9%分类准确率。在下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AToken为构建下一代多模态AI系统提供了统一的视觉分词基础，展示了在视觉生成和理解任务上的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MemEvo方法解决增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境，通过模拟海马体-前额叶皮层记忆机制实现知识保留与适应新数据的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增量多视图聚类中模型需要快速适应新数据（可塑性）同时保持长期知识稳定性（稳定性）的挑战，避免灾难性遗忘问题

Method: 1）海马体启发的视图对齐模块捕捉新视图增益信息；2）认知遗忘机制模拟人类记忆衰减模式调节历史知识权重；3）前额叶皮层启发的知识巩固记忆模块利用时间张量稳定性逐步巩固历史知识

Result: 在视图数量增长场景下展现出强大的知识保留能力，大量实验证明MemEvo相比现有最先进方法具有显著优势

Conclusion: 通过神经科学启发的记忆机制成功解决了增量多视图聚类中的稳定性-可塑性困境，为处理动态多视图数据提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种边缘引导的注意力机制，通过自适应调制图选择性增强结构显著区域，同时抑制伪纹理，在轻量级残差设计中实现参数高效的边缘先验注入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像超分辨率任务中恢复结构忠实的高频内容存在模糊性，现有边缘感知方法存在冗余、优化不稳定或结构增益有限的问题。

Method: 设计边缘引导注意力机制，从联合编码的边缘特征和中间特征激活中推导自适应调制图，应用于归一化和重加权响应；集成到轻量级残差设计中，使用像素级、感知和对抗性损失组合的复合目标进行训练。

Result: 在标准SISR基准测试中，相比SRGAN、ESRGAN和现有边缘注意力基线，在可比较的模型复杂度下，结构清晰度和感知质量均有持续改进。

Conclusion: 该公式化方法提供了参数高效的边缘先验注入路径，通过定制的多术语损失实现稳定的对抗性细化，无需更深或过度参数化的架构即可增强边缘保真度。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于分数扩散模型的自适应迭代点云去噪方法，通过噪声估计确定去噪步长，使用两阶段采样策略实现特征和梯度融合，在合成和真实扫描数据集上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要经验性地重复去噪过程，缺乏对不同噪声水平和模式的高效迭代安排机制。

Method: 基于分数扩散模型，先估计噪声变化并确定自适应去噪计划，然后迭代调用训练网络更新点云。采用特殊网络架构和两阶段采样策略实现特征融合和梯度融合。

Result: 获得干净平滑的去噪点云，更好地保持形状边界和细节，在合成数据集和真实扫描数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应迭代去噪方法在质量和定量指标上都优于现有技术，能够有效处理不同模式的噪声。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL是一个基于扩散模型的视觉定位框架，将视觉定位重新定义为GPS去噪任务，通过联合建模GPS、标准地图和视觉信号实现亚米级精度，无需依赖高精地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法面临高精地图成本高、可扩展性差的问题，而基于标准地图的方法忽略了普遍存在但有噪声的GPS信号。GPS在城市环境中存在多径误差，需要有效去噪方法。

Method: 提出DiffVL框架，利用扩散模型将噪声GPS轨迹与视觉BEV特征和标准地图结合，通过迭代扩散细化恢复真实位姿分布，学习逆转GPS噪声扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比BEV匹配基线实现了最先进的精度，达到亚米级定位精度。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够通过将噪声GPS作为生成先验来实现可扩展的定位，这代表了从传统基于匹配方法向生成式方法的范式转变。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DICE框架，通过将双智能体共识均衡集成到扩散模型采样过程中，有效结合生成先验和数据一致性，显著提升稀疏视图CT重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT重建由于欠采样导致病态逆问题，传统方法难以捕捉医学图像的复杂结构，而扩散模型作为强大的生成先验能准确建模复杂图像分布

Method: DICE框架包含两个智能体：数据一致性智能体（通过近端算子强制测量一致性）和先验智能体（通过扩散模型在每个采样步骤执行干净图像估计），通过迭代平衡这两个互补智能体

Result: 在15、30和60视图（总共180视图）的均匀和非均匀稀疏视图设置下，DICE显著优于最先进的基线方法，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: DICE成功将扩散模型的强大生成先验能力与测量一致性相结合，为稀疏视图CT重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

### [8] [Domain Adaptation for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation Using Patient-Level Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14573)
*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用患者级诊断结果作为弱监督的新型弱监督域适应方法，用于解决溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计中的域偏移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计方法面临不同医院成像设备和临床设置导致的域偏移问题，且传统域适应方法在目标域缺乏监督或标注成本高

Method: 使用共享聚合令牌和最大严重性三元组损失来对齐跨域的类级分布，利用患者级诊断由最严重区域决定的特性

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于其他域适应方法，在域偏移设置下改善了溃疡性结肠炎严重程度估计

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用常规记录的患者级诊断结果作为弱监督，有效解决了域适应中的监督不足问题

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建了一个包含100张蒙特利尔街景图像的小型基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在城市感知任务中的表现，涵盖照片和合成图像，包含30个维度的物理属性和主观印象标注


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人们如何解读城市街景可以为城市设计和规划提供参考，需要评估现有视觉语言模型在城市感知任务上的能力

Method: 使用100张街景图像（50张照片+50张合成图像），12名参与者提供230份标注，评估7个VLMs的零样本性能，使用结构化提示和确定性解析器

Result: 模型在可见客观属性上表现优于主观评价，最佳系统(claude-sonnet)在多标签项目上达到宏观0.31和平均Jaccard 0.48，合成图像得分略低

Conclusion: 发布了可复现的基准测试和评估工具，支持参与式城市分析中的不确定性感知评估，人类一致性高的维度模型表现更好

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出特征对齐运动变换(FMT)框架用于动态点云压缩，取代显式运动估计，通过时空对齐策略隐式建模时间变化，实现更好的压缩效率和并行处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态点云压缩严重依赖准确运动估计，但点云的不规则结构和显著局部变化使该任务极具挑战性。现有显式运动向量方法难以捕捉复杂动态且未能充分利用时间相关性

Method: 采用特征对齐运动变换框架，用时空对齐策略替代显式运动向量，在潜在空间条件编码框架中使用对齐特征作为时间上下文。设计随机访问参考策略支持双向运动参考和分层编码

Result: 在编码和解码效率上超越D-DPCC和AdaDPCC方法，分别实现20%和9.4%的BD-Rate降低，同时支持帧级并行压缩

Conclusion: FMT框架通过隐式建模连续时间变化和双向参考策略，有效提升了动态点云压缩效率和并行处理性能

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HybridMamba架构，通过双互补机制解决3D医学图像分割中全局与局部信息平衡问题，在MRI和CT数据集上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba在3D生物医学图像分割中表现优异，但过度关注全局上下文建模可能损害关键局部结构信息，导致边界模糊和区域失真

Method: 采用双互补机制：1）特征扫描策略逐步整合轴向遍历和局部自适应路径；2）结合空间-频率分析的门控模块进行全面上下文建模

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，HybridMamba在3D医学图像分割方面显著优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: HybridMamba成功解决了全局与局部信息平衡问题，为3D医学图像分割提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

### [12] [Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610)
*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态跳跃连接(DSC)块解决传统U型网络中跳跃连接的两个限制：特征间约束和特征内约束，通过测试时训练和动态多尺度核模块实现自适应特征融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跳跃连接存在静态特征融合和缺乏多尺度特征交互建模的问题，限制了医学图像分割的性能提升。

Method: 设计DSC块，包含测试时训练(TTT)模块处理特征间约束，动态多尺度核(DMSK)模块处理特征内约束，实现内容感知的特征精炼和多尺度特征整合。

Result: DSC块可无缝集成到各种U型网络架构中(CNN、Transformer、混合架构、Mamba)，实验证明其即插即用的有效性。

Conclusion: DSC块通过动态自适应机制显著提升了跨层连接性，为医学图像分割提供了通用的性能增强解决方案。

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LSTC-MDA框架，通过长短时时间卷积模块和增强的数据增广方法，解决了骨架动作识别中训练样本稀缺和长短期时间依赖建模的难题，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨架动作识别面临两个长期挑战：标注训练样本稀缺，以及难以同时建模短期和长期时间依赖关系。传统方法使用步长为2的时间卷积会丢失重要的长距离线索。

Method: 提出统一框架LSTC-MDA：1）长短时时间卷积模块（LSTC），包含并行的短期和长期分支，通过学习的相似性权重进行自适应对齐和融合；2）扩展的联合混合数据增广（JMDA），在输入层使用加法混合，限制在同一摄像机视角内操作以避免分布偏移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最优性能：NTU 60（X-Sub 94.1%，X-View 97.5%）、NTU 120（X-Sub 90.4%，X-Set 92.0%）、NW-UCLA（97.2%）。消融研究证实各组件均有贡献。

Conclusion: LSTC-MDA框架通过改进时间建模和增强数据多样性，有效解决了骨架动作识别的关键挑战，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Conclusion: MultiEdit为推进更多样化和挑战性的基于指令的图像编辑能力研究提供了宝贵资源，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

*Shinnosuke Hirano,Yuiga Wada,Tsumugi Iida,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于视觉基础模型的可视化解释生成方法，通过注意力网格适配器(ALA)和交替训练架构(AEA)机制，在提升模型可解释性的同时实现参数部分更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可视化解释方法缺乏适应性，难以应用于复杂模型，需要一种既能生成解释又能增强模型可解释性的解决方案。

Method: 引入ALA机制自动选择注意力层，无需人工干预；采用AEA机制每隔一个epoch更新ALA参数，解决注意力区域过小的问题。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和ImageNet-S数据集上，在平均IoU、插入分数、删除分数和插入-删除分数等指标上均优于基线方法，CUB数据集上平均IoU提升53.2点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视觉基础模型的可解释性，解决了现有方法适应性差和注意力区域过小的问题，在多个评估指标上表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN是一个利用基础模型进行线稿自动上色的新框架，通过融合基础模型的语义特征和CNN的空间特征，解决了遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化等挑战，并支持任意数量的参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在自动线稿上色方面虽然有所改进，但在处理遮挡、姿态变化和视角变化时仍存在困难，且通常只能支持有限的参考图像数量。

Method: 提出DACoN框架，利用基础模型捕获部件级语义信息，将低分辨率语义特征与CNN提取的高分辨率空间特征融合，实现细粒度且鲁棒的特征提取，同时移除了对参考图像数量的限制。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，使用多个参考图像能够带来显著优势，实现了卓越的上色性能。

Conclusion: DACoN通过融合基础模型和CNN特征，有效解决了线稿自动上色中的关键挑战，支持任意数量参考图像，在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available

TL;DR: FMGS-Avatar：一种从单目视频重建高保真可动画人体化身的创新方法，通过网格引导的2D高斯泼溅和基础模型知识蒸馏，解决了几何信息不足和表示限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目视频中几何信息不足，现有3D高斯泼溅方法在表面细节保持方面存在困难，需要更好的表示方法和信息补充手段。

Method: 提出Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting，将2D高斯基元直接附着在模板网格面上；利用Sapiens等基础模型补充视觉线索；采用选择性梯度隔离的协调训练策略解决多模态优化冲突。

Result: 实验评估显示相比现有方法具有更优的重建质量，在几何精度和外观保真度方面显著提升，同时提供丰富的语义信息，支持新颖视角和姿态下时空一致的渲染。

Conclusion: 通过增强表示和协调信息蒸馏的结合，该方法显著推进了3D单目人体化身重建技术，实现了高质量的几何细节保持和语义信息融合。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Result: 在五个数据集上验证有效性，在TIR、CIR和Chat-IR三个图像检索任务中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CoTRR方法成功利用MLLM的推理能力进行图像重排序，显著提升检索性能

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Conclusion: 利用扩散模型的大规模预训练为改善检测准确性提供了有前景的方法，特别是在标注稀缺且获取成本高的细分应用中

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

Method: 提出首个帧级准确的基准测试方法，在受控的帧采样策略下评估最先进的小型视觉语言模型，开源基准测试代码

Result: 结果证实了存在采样偏差，并揭示了不同帧采样技术下SVLMs的数据特定和任务特定行为

Conclusion: 需要为每个基准数据集制定标准化的帧采样策略，提供了可重复且无偏的视频VLM评估协议

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

Motivation: 解决现有参数化点云表示方法在计算效率和表示精度之间的争执：高适配模型计算费用高，而实时方法又缺乏足够的自由度来精确表示复杂表面

Method: 首先使用高斯混合模型对点云进行分割集群，然后选择平坦集群合并为平面或曲面。平面采用2D基于像素的边界描述方法进行拟合和定界，曲面则通过B样条曲面拟合并使用同样的边界描述方法

Result: 在多个公开数据集上评估，该方法在表面检测方面比现有最先进方法更加稳健，效率提升3.78倍，精度比高斯混合模型提升2倍，在低功耗板载计算机上达到36.4fps

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的多模型参数化表示方法，成功地在计算效率和表示精度之间取得了平衡，为点云处理和多机器人协作等应用提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度网络训练对大数据集和计算资源的依赖问题，尤其是在超分辨率预任务中。现有GAN逆向数据蓄粮方法存在依赖预训练模型和类别信息的限制，影响了方法的通用性。

Method: 首先提取高梯度补丁并使用CLIP特征对图像进行分类，然后微调模型在选择的补丁上进行细调以学习其分布并合成蓄粮训练图像。

Result: 在仅使用0.68%原始数据集的情况下，性能下降仅0.3dB，微调模型细调耗时4小时，SR模型训练在1小时内完成，远少于全量数据训练的11小时。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、通用的数据蓄粮解决方案，在显著减少训练数据和计算成本的同时保持了独特的超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像潜在扩散模型在医学图像合成方面取得进展，但应用于3D CT生成时仍有限制。现有方法依赖简化提示，忽略了完整放射学报告中的丰富语义细节，导致文本图像对齐和临床保真度降低。

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

Result: 在皮胯和躯关节分割实验中显示了算法的有效性，实现了准确、稳定且一致的性能

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效处理骨分割中的复杂问题，为领域知识与深度神经网络的结合提供了新的思路

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Conclusion: ProtoMedX在保持最先进性能的同时提供了临床医生可直观理解的解释，满足了医疗AI对准确性和可解释性的双重需求

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their

MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of

models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic

Result: 在五个传统基准测试和数据集（包括合成和真实场景）上，该框架相比之前基于正则化的方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 针对噪声过拟合问题提出的特征去噪框架是有效的通用解决方案，能显著提升超分辨率模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 复现Faithful Vision Transformers (FViTs)的研究，验证Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)在提升Vision Transformers可解释性鲁棒性方面的效果，并扩展分析了计算成本和环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证arXiv:2311.17983论文中关于DDS能够提升Vision Transformers在分割和分类任务中对攻击和扰动的鲁棒性的主张，并扩展研究其普适性和实际应用成本。

Method: 复现FViTs方法，使用DDS技术测试其在分割任务中对攻击的鲁棒性和在分类任务中对扰动和攻击的鲁棒性，同时测试DDS对基线方法和Attribution Rollout方法的普适性改进效果。

Result: 研究结果总体上与原研究一致，证实了DDS确实能够提升可解释性方法的鲁棒性，但也发现了一些细微差异并进行了讨论。

Conclusion: DDS技术能够有效增强Vision Transformers可解释性方法的抗攻击能力，但需要权衡其带来的计算成本和环境影响。

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers
(FViTs) proposed by arXiv:2311.17983 alongside interpretability methods for
Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

TL;DR: MARIC是一个多智能体框架，将图像分类重构为协作推理过程，通过多个智能体从不同视角分析图像并综合推理，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分类方法需要大量参数训练和标注数据，而现有的视觉语言模型依赖单次表示，难以捕捉视觉内容的互补方面。

Method: 使用Outliner Agent分析图像全局主题并生成提示，三个Aspect Agent从不同视觉维度提取细粒度描述，Reasoning Agent通过集成反思步骤综合这些输出生成统一表示。

Result: 在4个不同的图像分类基准数据集上，MARIC显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体视觉推理对于实现鲁棒且可解释的图像分类非常有效，能够缓解参数密集型训练和单一VLM推理的缺点。

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Motivation: 人像图像在计算机视觉中的应用日益增多，需要保护个人身份信息，同时匿名化后的图像仍需保持对下游计算机视觉任务的有用性。

Method: 设计了适配性属性导向模块，在反向去噪过程中应用梯度纠正，使生成图像的面部属性与合成目标图像的属性对齐，并支持指定面部区域的局部匿名化。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和FFHQ公开数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法超越了现有最先进方法，且无需额外模型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种高效、可控的人像匿名化方案，在保护隐私的同时确保了图像对下游任务的实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Motivation: 个化治疗决策需要预测个体对治疗的响应，而疾病进展和治疗效果在不同患者间存在显著差异

Method: 从乳腾癌NACT治疗的MRI图像数据中学习早期治疗响应的动态表征，将纵向变化形成潜在空间中的轨迹，作为预测基础，多任务模型表征外观、促进时间连续性并考虑非响应者群体的高异质性

Result: 在ISPY-2数据集上，潜在轨迹空间中的线性分类器达到了平衡准确度：仅使用治前数据(T0)为0.761，使用早期响应数据(T0+T1)为0.811，使用四个成像时间点(T0->T3)为0.861

Conclusion: 通过学习治疗响应的动态图像表征，可以有效预测乳腾癌完全病理缓解，为个化治疗决策提供了有价值的预测方法

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Result: 实验证明该方法能够恢复相关的3D视觉线索，并提供了关于位姿估计网络监督与其对目标航天器隐式表示之间关系的额外见解

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对航天器位姿估计网络决策过程的可视化，有助于提高数据驱动位姿估计方法在实际任务中的可信度和应用前景

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Conclusion: 伪标签训练和多模型流水线推理策略能够有效提升复杂视频对象分割的准确性和稳健性

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

TL;DR: CLIP基础模型在专业化生物识别任务微调后会出现过度专业化问题，导致跨域泛化能力下降，其中任务复杂度和分类头设计是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLIP基础模型在面部识别、形态攻击检测和呈现攻击检测等专业化任务微调后，是否会出现过度专业化而丧失原有跨域泛化能力的问题。

Method: 评估三个针对FR、MAD和PAD任务微调的CLIP实例，在14个通用视觉数据集上进行零样本和线性探测测试，同时对比常见生物识别基准测试。

Result: 微调模型确实存在过度专业化，特别是在复杂的面部识别任务中。FRoundation模型在IJB-C基准上提升58.52%，但在ImageNetV2上性能从69.84%降至51.63%。更大的模型架构能更好地保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务复杂度和分类头设计（多分类vs二分类）与灾难性遗忘程度相关，增加模型容量有助于缓解过度专业化问题，在专业化和泛化之间需要权衡。

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Motivation: 现有检测模型主要关注简单的真实性分类，只能提供伪造概率或二元判断，缺乏对图像真实性的解释性见解。而基于MLLM的检测方法虽然能提供更可解释的结果，但在纯真实性分类精度上仍落后于专家模型。

Method: 提出DF-LLaVA框架，首先从MLLM中提取潜在知识，然后通过提示注入到训练中，释放MLLM的内在判别潜力。

Result: 实验证明DF-LLaVA在合成图像检测方面具有优越性，实现了超过专家模型的检测精度，同时保持了MLLM提供的可解释性。

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA成功解决了合成图像检测中精度和可解释性难以兼得的问题，为图像真实性评估提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Conclusion: CMGR框架有效解决了3D类增量学习中的关键挑战，为开放世界场景的可扩展识别系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了fMRI分析的新几何深度学习范式，凸显了双曲GNN在计算精神病学领域的巨大潜力

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Method: 两阶段识别框架：第一阶段使用大型视觉模型提取2D特征生成候选排名；第二阶段通过轻量级3D特征感知模块判断是否需要3D重排序，使用机器人3D检索变换器进行几何感知的密集特征提取和基于关键点的匹配。

Result: RoboEye在Recall@1指标上比之前的state-of-the-art方法(RoboLLM)提升了7.1%，且仅需RGB图像，降低了部署成本。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过有效结合2D和3D特征，在复杂仓库环境中实现了更准确和高效的物体识别，为大规模电商自动化包装提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

Motivation: 现有的随机遮蓋策略忽视了点云的几何结构和语义一致性，无法捕捉跨方向的空间关系和旋转不变的语义部件，导致旋转不变性表征学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出双流沿遮蓋方法：3D空间网格遮蓋通过坐标排序创建结构化模式捕捉几何关系，渐进语义遮蓋利用注意力聚类发现语义部件并保持其一致性。通过课程学习和动态权重协调两种流沿，从几何理解进渐到语义发现。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和OmniObject3D数据集上进行的综合实验显示，该方法在各种旋转场景下均实现了一致的性能提升，且显著超过了基准旋转不变方法的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的双流沿遮蓋方法有效解决了旋转不变点云MAE中随机遮蓋的局限性，通过合理的遮蓋策略同时考虑了几何结构和语义一致性，为点云表征学习提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Motivation: 传统超声诊断高度依赖医生经验，存在主观性强和诊断效率低的问题。现有通用视觉语言模型在超声医学任务中知识有限，多器官病变识别泛化能力差，多任务诊断效率低。

Method: 采用专家混合(MoE)架构，在涵盖七个解剖区域的数据集上进行训练，设计专门用于超声医学成像的视觉语言模型。

Result: 在超声报告生成任务上，相比Qwen2-VL模型，BLEU-1分数提升10.15分，ROUGE-1分数提升4.77分，表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: EchoVLM在提升超声成像诊断准确性方面具有巨大潜力，为未来临床应用提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and
model weights are available at https://github.com/Asunatan/EchoVLM.

Conclusion: 通过开源数据和模型推动室内场景理解和生成领域的发展，为社区提供强大工具

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个用于零售产品检索的三阶段混合方法，结合了视觉语言模型和像素级匹配的优势，在ABV数据集上比现有方法提升4.21%的top-1准确率，同时保持实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像检索在零售场景中面临挑战：同类型不同品牌产品外观高度相似，查询图像视角与目录图像差异大。基础模型难以区分细微局部差异，而像素级匹配方法计算成本过高。

Method: 三阶段混合方法：1）使用SigLIP视觉语言模型检索前35个最相似产品缩小搜索空间；2）应用YOLO-E分割模型去除背景干扰；3）对筛选候选使用LightGlue进行细粒度像素级匹配。

Result: 在ABV数据集上的实验表明，PRISM在top-1准确率上比最先进的图像检索方法高出4.21%，同时仍保持在实时处理范围内，适合实际零售部署。

Conclusion: PRISM通过结合语义相似性和细粒度像素匹配的优势，能够更准确地区分类间相似度高的产品，关注全局模型经常忽略的细微视觉线索，为零售产品检索提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic

Conclusion: 该方法仅需单个RGB视频作为唯一监督，就能实现更准确和高效的动态场景相机参数优化

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

Motivation: 以前的RAG攻击依赖操纵用户查询，实际不可行，而指令提示常被公开共享且缺乏审计，成为暴露点

Method: 使用遗传算法优化导致数据检索偏差的恶意指令提示，通过多样化查询生成模拟真实语言变化

Result: AIP攻击成功率达95.23%，同时保持良性功能，显示了指令提示的安全漏洞

Conclusion: 指令提示存在重要安全风险，需重新评估共享指令的安全性

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and

Conclusion: M&N框架有效地利用2D预训练知识提升3D医学图像分割性能，具有良好的适配性和扩展性，为医学图像分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出RA-GAN模型解决亲属验证中的年龄差距问题，通过消除种族偏见的面部老化生成器，显著提升跨年龄亲属验证准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亲属验证中父母与子女照片存在年龄差距，且同年龄照片难以获取，现有面部老化模型存在种族偏见，影响照片相似度判断

Method: 提出RA-GAN模型，包含RACEpSp和特征混合器两个新模块，生成无种族偏见的合成图像，用于同年龄父母-子女图像的亲属验证

Result: RA-GAN在所有年龄组平均比SAM-GAN提升13.14%，在60+年龄组比CUSP-GAN提升9.1%；在KinFaceW-I数据集上，父子、父女、母子、母女关系的验证准确率分别提升5.22%、5.12%、1.63%、0.41%

Conclusion: RA-GAN能有效消除种族偏见，保持身份特征，将父母和子女图像转换为同年龄可显著提升所有年龄组的亲属验证准确率

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

TL;DR: 利用多模态大语言模型进行零样本时空视频定位，通过解耦查询和时序增强策略提升定位性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时空视频定位任务中需要大量标注数据，本文探索利用MLLMs的零样本能力来解决STVG问题，发现MLLMs存在动态分配grounding token但整合文本线索能力不足的问题

Method: 提出DSTH策略将查询解耦为属性和动作子查询，使用LRA模块学习空间和时间提示；TAS策略通过时序增强帧输入提升时间一致性

Result: 在三个STVG基准测试中超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效释放了MLLMs的推理能力，为STVG任务提供了有效的零样本解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业需要准确的玉米幼苗检测，但现有数据集稀缺。传统方法劳动密集且易出错，计算机视觉可实现高效准确检测。

Method: 构建包含单株、双株和三株植物三个类别的航空图像数据集，涵盖不同生长阶段、种植设置、土壤类型、光照条件、相机角度和密度。使用YOLO系列模型进行基准测试。

Result: 单株检测精度达0.984，召回率达0.873。YOLO11推理速度最快（35ms/图像），YOLOv9单株检测准确率最高。双株和三株检测较困难，主要由于罕见性和外观不规则。

Conclusion: MSDD为开发株数统计模型提供了坚实基础，有助于优化资源分配和支持实时决策，推动了农业监测自动化和精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Motivation: 自回归模型作为一种生成范式在视觉领域遇到了理解高级视觉语义的挑战，需要系统性研究应用下一个token预测范式的机制

Method: 提出ST-AR训练框架，通过在训练过程中引入自盘目标来解决三个关键问题：局部条件依赖、步骤间语义不一致性和空间不变性缺失

Result: ST-AR在不依赖预训练表征模型的情况下显著提升了自回归模型的图像理解能力和生成质量，LlamaGen-L和LlamaGen-XL的FID指标分别提升了42%和49%

Conclusion: 通过自盘学习方法可以有效充分发挥自回归模型在视觉领域的潜力，为视觉自回归模型的训练提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Conclusion: SyncSeal为图像水印提供了有效的同步解决方案，能够有效升级现有水印方法，使其能够抵御之前易受攻击的几何变换

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Result: 在相同下游机器人数据集上微调后，RynnVLA-001实现了优于最先进基线的性能表现

Conclusion: 所提出的预训练策略为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更有效的初始化方法，证明了视频生成预训练对VLA模型的重要性

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

Conclusion: 扩散模型可以成功应用于MVS任务，通过条件扩散过程实现高效的深度优化，为3D重建提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在置信度校准方面存在严重不足，错误校准的预测会导致过度自信的错误，影响临床信任和决策可靠性。

Method: 开发CalibPrompt框架，在少量标注数据下优化可学习提示，使用正则化器对齐平滑准确率和预测置信度，引入角度分离损失最大化文本特征接近度。

Conclusion: CalibPrompt是首个在提示调优过程中校准Med-VLMs的框架，有效解决了医学视觉语言模型的置信度校准问题。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is

Abstract: Modelling the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases demands
methods that capture heterogeneous and spatially varying dynamics from sparse,
high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Integrating partial differential equation
(PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced
interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current
physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single
PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms
are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems
with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative
model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based
PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure.
Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder
(VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of
interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from
neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and
demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's
disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Images play a vital role in improving the readability and comprehension of
Wikipedia articles by serving as `illustrative aids.' However, not all images
are equally effective and not all Wikipedia editors are trained in their
selection. We propose QuizRank, a novel method of image selection that
leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to
rank images as learning interventions. Our approach transforms textual
descriptions of the article's subject into multiple-choice questions about
important visual characteristics of the concept. We utilize these questions to
quiz the VLM: the better an image can help answer questions, the higher it is
ranked. To further improve discrimination between visually similar items, we
introduce a Contrastive QuizRank that leverages differences in the features of
target (e.g., a Western Bluebird) and distractor concepts (e.g., Mountain
Bluebird) to generate questions. We demonstrate the potential of VLMs as
effective visual evaluators by showing a high congruence with human quiz-takers
and an effective discriminative ranking of images.

TL;DR: KAMAC是一个知识驱动的自适应多智能体协作框架，通过动态组建专家团队来解决医疗决策中跨专业知识整合的问题，在复杂临床场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体协作框架使用静态预分配角色，限制了适应性和动态知识整合能力，无法有效模拟真实医疗团队根据诊断需求动态调整专家的协作过程。

Method: 提出KAMAC框架，从初始专家智能体开始，通过知识驱动讨论识别知识缺口，根据需要动态招募额外专家，支持灵活可扩展的协作，最终通过审查更新的智能体评论来做出决策。

Result: 在两个真实医疗基准测试中，KAMAC显著优于单智能体和先进的多智能体方法，特别是在需要动态跨专业知识的复杂临床场景（如癌症预后）中表现突出。

Conclusion: KAMAC框架成功模拟了医疗多学科团队的动态协作过程，为复杂临床决策提供了更有效的AI辅助解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple
clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams.
Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate
expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent
interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder
adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations,
we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration
framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams
based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert
agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill
knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports
flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions
finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two
real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms
both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex
clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty
expertise. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出RLVR方法增强多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，通过可验证奖励机制改进几何图像标注数据生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在复杂几何问题上表现不佳，主要缺乏高质量的几何图像-文本对数据集，且模板化数据合成方法泛化能力有限

Method: 引入强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)机制，基于50个基础几何关系合成几何图像，利用数学问题解决任务获得的奖励信号来优化图像标注

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse的非几何图像任务上获得2.8%-4.8%的准确率提升，在MMMU的艺术、设计、技术、工程任务上获得2.4%-3.9%的改进

Conclusion: RLVR方法能有效提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力和泛化性能，即使在分布外场景下也能增强模型的一般推理能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that
demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models
still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from
the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric
images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically
fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation
pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized
from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from
mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key
features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization
and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution
scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of
$2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks
with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with
$2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks
in MMMU.

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在城市规划和政策评估中的应用潜力，通过街区环境指标的自动化量化来支持地方政策刊介的跟踪评估

Method: 采用结构化的推理-估计流水线，利用GPT-4o分析街景图像，在准实验设计中评估1930年代红线划分的遗产影响

Result: GPT-4o准确重现了红线划分对社会环境的负面影响，估计结果与权威数据源统计上无差异，且表现超过传统像素分割基线方法

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型可作为政策级别的街区测量工具，需要在更广泛的政策评估场景中进行验证

Abstract: This paper shows how a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can expand
urban measurement capacity and support tracking of place-based policy
interventions. Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view
imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in
a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o
recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining,
with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and
it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with
the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond
object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments
for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across
policy-evaluation settings.

TL;DR: 一种新的一步多视图聚类方法OMCAL，通过适应性低矩锚图学习解决了现有锚图聚类方法的信息冗余、噪声干扰和效率低下的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚图基多视图聚类方法存在两大问题：1）直接嵌入多样锚图忽略了冗余信息和噪声，导致聚类效果下降；2）独立后处理获取聚类指标使效果和效率降低

Method: 提出OMCAL方法，采用核范数基的适应性CAG学习模型来对抗信息冗余和噪声干扰，并将类别指标获取与CAG学习集成到统一框架中

Result: 在普通和大规模数据集上进行的众多实验表明，OMCAL在聚类效果和效率方面都超越了现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: OMCAL方法通过一步集成框架有效解决了多视图锚图聚类中的关键问题，在保持结构信息的同时提高了聚类性能和效率

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing
computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods
have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems.
Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1)
They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph
(CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in
these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They
drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire
clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a
novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph
learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear
norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise
interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency
substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning
into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and
large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出ADC框架，通过注意力机制双重压缩策略显著降低Split Learning中的通信开销，同时保持高精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Learning训练过程中需要传输中间激活值，通信开销大，特别是Vision Transformers的激活值传输成本高

Method: 采用两种并行压缩策略：1）基于注意力分数合并相似样本激活（类无关）；2）丢弃最不重要的token，实现前向和梯度的自然压缩

Result: ADC框架显著减少通信开销，在保持高精度的同时优于现有SL框架

Conclusion: 基于注意力的双重压缩策略有效解决了Split Learning中的通信瓶颈问题，无需额外调优即可实现高效训练

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable
and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN
architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time
inference on edge platforms.

<details>

Motivation: Wi-Fi CSI信号存在AP时钟异步和环境硬件噪声问题，即使现有预处理技术也难以完全消除对DoRF中多普勒速度投影的干扰，限制了人体活动识别性能

Method: 设计多天线AP框架，基于DoRF拟合误差抑制噪声并选择信息量最丰富的天线，利用多普勒速度投影不一致性来识别最优感知配置

Result: 在小型手势识别数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了Wi-Fi HAR的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该DoRF引导的Wi-Fi感知方法为鲁棒的实际部署铺平了道路，解决了噪声和异常值对感知性能的限制

Abstract: With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard
for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified
three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)
derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of
Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI
signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive
noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing
preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections
used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for
multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas
based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler
velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand
gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided
Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,
paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型虽然具有丰富的空间先验知识，但可控性有限且几何不一致，阻碍了其在3D/4D任务中的实际应用，而重新训练或微调会破坏预训练知识且计算成本高。

Method: 提出三个紧密耦合的模块：1）步内递归细化机制在推理时优化网络预测；2）流门控潜在融合利用光流相似性解耦运动和外观；3）双路径自校正指导比较有指导和无指导的去噪路径来校正轨迹漂移。

Conclusion: 这项工作为可控视频合成引入了一种新颖的即插即用范式，为利用生成先验进行空间智能提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人部署中视觉分支面临对抗性和自然损坏，现有防御方法仅关注清洁和对抗特征对齐而忽略跨模态对应关系，导致鲁棒性提升有限且影响零样本迁移能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对清洁-对抗对进行无监督微调以硬化视觉编码器；第二阶段最小化清洁/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类间分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的实验表明，RLBind在清洁准确率和有界对抗鲁棒性方面均优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高鲁棒性，为机器人在导航、操作等自主场景中提供更安全的多传感器感知解决方案。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.
