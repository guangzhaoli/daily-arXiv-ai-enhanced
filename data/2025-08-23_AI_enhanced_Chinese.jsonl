These methods involve computing\nthe argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not\ndifferentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,\nto enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this\nlong-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the\nonly way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative\ntraining objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.\nEmpirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial\nlandmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during\ntraining while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

While\nimage and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth\nmaps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective\nviews, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion\nmodels excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but\noften struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with\nrendered control videos.

Building on this insight, our approach\nenhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The\npipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically\nconsistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we\npropagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and\nthird, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)\nusing the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface.

Although classical post-processing techniques such as\nwatershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to\nseparate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is\nconstrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal\ntissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided\nbinary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology.

However, due to the extended\ntrajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN\nperformance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly\ndetailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which\ncould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion\nspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV\nCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct\naltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,\nand a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training\nand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising\n13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with\ntarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps\nand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's\ngeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.\nTo consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV\ncollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a\nmultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the\nlow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and\ntarget grounding.

Most existing methods adopt a\nfirst-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are\nsupervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the\ndetection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology\nreasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this\npaper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology\nreasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.\nSpecifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the\ncross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane\npredictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many\nassignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with\nindependent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.\nExtensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology\nreasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic\ntopology performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RATopo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0cRATopo\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ea4\u6362\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenLane-V2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cRATopo\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f66\u9053\u95f4\u53ca\u8f66\u9053\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RATopo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u62d3\u6251\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,\nwith limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper\naims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different\nnumbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of\nlayers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a\nfine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting\nindicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,\nforming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,\nwhile higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,\ncertain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question\nanswering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute\nminimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling\nrelies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame\nself-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational\ncost.

By\nconcentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune\nreduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased\ncomputational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across\ndiverse data characteristics and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioTune\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002BioTune\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "BioTune\u4f7f\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cBioTune\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982AutoRGN\u548cLoRA\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "BioTune\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature.

To\naddress the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view\nsettings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates\ncamera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent\ncontent as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we\nintroduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive\nspatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of\ngeometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,\nachieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view\nconditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method\nexhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,\nresulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700SfM\u76843DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0bSfM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bc6\u96c6\u7acb\u4f53\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u4ee3SfM\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5e72\u89c6\u56fe\u63d2\u503c\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u4ec52\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u53472.75dB\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5931\u771f\u5c0f\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

However, these methods depend on stale\noffline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable\ncomputational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,\nwe introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D\nPatch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked\nSemantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive\nexperiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves\nthe student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously\naccelerating inference speed.

In this contribution,\nCM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models\nleveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.\nUnlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs\nwith synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map\nGenerator (SCMG).

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:\nprompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for\ndirect segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a\nrange of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face\nchallenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying\nspecific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we\npropose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational\npathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This\nmodel incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging\nlay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for\ndetailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to\nemphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with\nSAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating\nMolecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results\nfrom both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model\nsignificantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with\nvarying annotation quality.

However, their global denoising process\ninherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading\nto unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing\ninstructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by\nformulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual\ntokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the\nadherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present\nVAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as\na next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text\ninstructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise\nedits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the\nsource image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot\neffectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects\nscale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.\nVAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and\nefficiency.

Recent efforts have\nexplored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential\nhigher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these\nmethods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive\npatterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency\ninformation when the model generates visual content exceeding its training\nresolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the\naccumulated errors.

SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and\ninferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal\nVF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only\nstructural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,\nrespectively.

However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during\nthe measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative\nmethods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may\nnot be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require\nmanual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less\nadaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning\napproach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field\nregime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A\nphysics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both\nthe phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane\nfrom a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase\nretrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated\ntraining data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,\nas acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due\nto the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The\nalgorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging\nconditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality\nreconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at\nbeamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum\nHereon.

To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is\nembedded after the 2D CSC.

We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well.

Currently, annotation is primarily performed\nthrough manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,\nwhich often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful\ntools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on\nwell-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly\navailable MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.\n  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight\nneural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex\nstructures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is\na Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on\nthe CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural\nnetworks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset\nreaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually\nannotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset\n(annotated 200 images).

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.
