### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级重建，实现高效骨架建模，训练速度提升6.2倍，在下游任务中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码自编码器方法将重建目标限制在原始关节坐标或简单变体，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 提出协作学习框架，通过轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性并防止模型崩溃

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60、NTU RGB+D 120和PKU-MMD数据集上验证，训练速度提升6.2倍，在下游任务中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测实现了计算效率和表示质量的双重提升，为骨架行为识别提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Susan Done,Dimitrios Androutsos,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于UNet分割的师生模型，通过域泛化模块和伪掩码生成技术，同时解决有丝分裂检测和异常有丝分裂分类任务，有效应对域偏移和数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家手动计数有丝分裂图耗时且存在观察者间差异，AI工具面临域偏移和数据严重不平衡的挑战。

Method: 使用UNet分割主干网络，集成对比表示学习和域对抗训练模块，采用师生策略生成像素级伪掩码，并引入多尺度CNN分类器进行多任务学习。

Result: 在初步测试集上，Track 1获得F1分数0.7660，Track 2获得平衡准确率0.8414。

Conclusion: 将基于分割的检测和分类整合到统一框架中，能够实现鲁棒的有丝分裂分析，有效提升域泛化能力和分类性能。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GMBM框架解决多偏差问题，通过两阶段方法识别并抑制多种视觉偏差，在多个数据集上提升最差组准确率并降低偏差放大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别化妆、场景对象配对等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的性能和公平性，且单独处理一种偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)训练编码器识别已知偏差属性；2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning从主干网络梯度中修剪偏差方向，最终得到忽略所有偏差的紧凑网络

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，在Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA)指标上达到新低

Conclusion: GMBM是首个实用的端到端多偏差解决方案，能够有效处理偏差复杂性和分布偏移问题

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发轻量级U-Net模型用于心脏超声左心室分割，在保持与nnU-Net相当性能的同时，参数量减少16倍，速度提升4倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有nnU-Net模型虽然性能良好但参数量大、速度慢，限制了实时临床应用，需要开发更轻量高效的模型

Method: 通过消融研究分析nnU-Net各组件效果，发现简单仿射增强和深度监督是关键，基于此设计轻量U-Net架构

Result: 在CAMUS数据集上达到与nnU-Net统计相当的Dice分数(0.93/0.85/0.89)，参数量仅2M vs 33M，处理速度1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧

Conclusion: 轻量级U-Net在心脏分割任务中实现了性能与效率的平衡，为实时临床应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了treeX算法的修订版本，用于无监督的树木实例分割，通过聚类茎干检测和区域生长冠层划分，为地面和无人机激光扫描数据提供参数预设，相比原算法显著提升运行速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离激光扫描提供详细的森林3D数据，但需要高效处理点云数据和提取单株树木的软件。虽然深度学习方法有效，但需要大量标注数据和计算资源，因此需要资源效率更高的替代方案。

Method: 修订treeX算法，结合基于聚类的茎干检测和区域生长冠层划分的无监督方法。为地面激光扫描（TLS和PLS）和无人机激光扫描（ULS）提供两种参数预设。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上评估，相比原treeX算法减少运行时间并提高精度，地面数据F1分数提升+0.11到+0.49。ULS数据F1分数达0.58，而原算法无法正确分割。TLS和PLS数据精度与最新开源方法（包括深度学习）相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有两个主要应用：作为深度学习方法的资源高效替代方案（在数据特征符合方法设计时），以及为深度学习模型半自动生成标签。提供开源Python实现pointtree包以促进广泛采用。

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D提出了一种创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过几何感知监督来增强多模态模型的3D空间理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型主要依赖文本监督，缺乏几何约束，难以学习鲁棒的3D空间表示，限制了3D场景理解的发展

Method: 采用双监督范式，设计对象级和帧级重建任务的双编码器架构，将3D几何信息同时作为输入和显式学习目标，强制几何一致性

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅描述来实现有效的3D理解

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是首个完全量化的多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一的端到端量化策略，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算负载和传输带宽，系统延迟降低3.2倍，并在部署导向指标上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X协同感知研究主要关注精度指标，忽视了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级考量。全精度模型计算和传输成本高，难以在资源受限环境中实时运行。

Method: 提出统一的端到端量化策略，同时对神经网络模型和传输消息表示进行量化，降低计算负载和传输带宽。

Result: 在低比特约束下达到与全精度系统相当的精度，系统级延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30提升+9.5，能更有效地扩展模型规模以适应严格内存预算。

Conclusion: 证明了完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中的可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0三种深度学习架构在基于叶片脉纹模式的植物物种自动分类中的效果，发现EfficientNetB0表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶片脉纹模式是植物分类学中重要的形态特征，具有高度的分类相关性。研究旨在开发基于深度学习的自动化植物分类工具，利用脉纹特征实现准确和可扩展的分类。

Method: 使用包含15个不同物种的瑞典叶片数据集（每个物种75张图像，共1,125张图像），对ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0三种深度学习模型进行训练和测试，采用标准性能指标进行评估。

Conclusion: 深度学习特别是EfficientNetB0在基于脉纹特征的自动化植物分类中具有巨大潜力，能够开发出可扩展且准确的分类工具，MobileNetV2适合轻量级实时应用。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种高效的图匹配方法，通过延迟跨图节点级交互到联合嵌入架构的末尾，使用可微分图核作为距离函数，在保持相似比较性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢，需要更高效的图比较方法。

Method: 推迟跨图节点级交互到联合嵌入架构的末尾，使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数。

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图匹配方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率，适用于建筑平面图等图结构数据的比较应用。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种基于奇异值分解的多模态参数高效适应方法，仅需调整CLIP模型0.04%的参数即可实现领域适应，在多个自然和生物医学数据集上达到最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs适应方法依赖提示工程和完整模型微调，成本高昂且可能破坏预训练知识，需要一种更高效稳定的适应技术。

Method: 利用SVD分解CLIP参数矩阵，仅微调奇异值来重新缩放基向量，保持预训练模型结构不变，不引入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上获得最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD通过参数高效的SVD方法实现了更好的领域适应性能，同时保持了模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STA-Net模型，通过训练免费的神经架构搜索和形状-纹理注意力模块，在边缘设备上实现高效的植物病害诊断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级网络使用的注意力机制主要针对通用目标识别，难以捕捉植物病害的细微病理特征（如不规则病变形状和复杂纹理）

Method: 使用DeepMAD神经架构搜索方法构建高效网络骨干，并设计STAM模块将注意力分解为形状感知（使用可变形卷积DCNv4）和纹理感知（使用Gabor滤波器组）两个分支

Result: 在CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net（401K参数，51.1M FLOPs）达到89.00%准确率和88.96% F1分数，显著优于基线和标准注意力模型

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制整合领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is
available at https://github.com/RzMY/STA-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了水下伪装目标检测任务和DeepCamo数据集，开发了SLENet框架，通过GAE模块和LGB分支增强特征表示，在多个数据集上验证了优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但受光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的影响，该任务研究不足且检测精度低

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement模块增强多尺度特征，Localization Guidance Branch生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder进行精确预测

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并展现出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，DeepCamo数据集为该领域研究提供了重要基准，方法具有优越性能和良好泛化能力

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出利用视频帧时间连续性偏置来改进扩散模型训练的方法，无需架构修改即可加速收敛并提高生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图像训练存在信息不足的问题，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和泛化能力降低

Method: 利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置，设计简单有效的训练策略，可无缝集成到标准扩散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上收敛速度提升2倍以上，训练和验证分布上的FID更低，生成多样性得到改善

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少梯度方差加速收敛，能有效捕捉有意义的时间变化，提高扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐来解决放射学诊断中的误读和沟通问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学诊断错误（包括误读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告这三个需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，执行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过结合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射学分析中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度数据集上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉细微类别差异的方法。

Method: 提出CaPL方法，包含属性解耦模块（使用布朗桥扩散模型分解视觉特征）和粒度学习模块（通过因果推理策略构建视觉粒度）。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验结果表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习到更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于事件相机的湍流消除新方法，通过事件流的时空分布特性提取像素级可靠引导，实现高效湍流消除，在模型大小、推理延迟和复杂度上相比现有方法提升数百倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习湍流消除方法需要高容量网络从有限帧率的同步帧中学习粗粒度湍流动态，计算和存储效率低下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率，可以通过稀疏异步成像机制从根本上解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出事件幸运洞察理论，揭示湍流畸变与事件流逆时空分布的关联；构建EGTM框架，从显式但噪声的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的无湍流引导，用于时间幸运融合；建立首个真实世界事件驱动湍流数据集。

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上，方法在恢复质量上达到SOTA（+0.94 PSNR和+0.08 SSIM），同时模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度分别比现有SOTA方法提升710倍、214倍和224倍。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流消除任务具有显著效率优势，事件相机为湍流消除提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

TL;DR: FocusMamba通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化和跨模态聚焦融合，在RGB-事件检测中实现了精度和效率的更好平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳，需要自适应稀疏化方法来提升效率

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略识别并自适应丢弃低信息区域，以及跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上实现了优于现有方法的精度和效率

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效信息整合，为RGB-事件检测提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing

surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自回归的方法在长期占用生成中存在效率低下、时间退化和缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时处理3D几何细粒度捕捉和动态演化。

Method: 将占用世界模型重新表述为时间多尺度预测任务，使用TensFormer管理时间因果关系和空间关系，并提出整体位姿聚合策略实现占用和自运动的统一序列建模。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间上都优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间多尺度预测框架和TensFormer架构，成功实现了高效、高质量且可控的长期占用生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督学习方法，利用视觉语言模型伪标注多视角图像来获取功能部件，结合密集对比学习建立密集功能对应关系，用于跨类别物体的密集对应匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系对形状重建和机器人操作至关重要。物体功能（即物体对其他物体产生的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的物体部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 提出弱监督学习范式：1）利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件；2）结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识；3）构建能够建立密集功能对应关系的新模型。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用物体功能信息和视觉语言模型的伪标注能力，成功实现了跨类别物体的密集功能对应关系建立，为相关应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理并在CLIP骨干网络中具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter成功解决了少样本学习中的过拟合问题，提供了一种无需重新训练基础模型的有效适应方案

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务的参考无关评估指标，通过增强CLIP的特异性来奖励正确细节并惩罚错误信息，在保持与人类判断高相关性的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标存在诸多问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽相关性好但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用

Method: 基于CLIP进行改进，引入新的目标函数来增强特异性 - 正确描述细节时给予奖励，错误描述时进行惩罚，从而构建SPECS指标

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，使其成为图像描述模型开发中迭代检查点评估的实用替代方案

Conclusion: SPECS为长图像描述任务提供了一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的评估指标，解决了现有指标在计算成本和相关性之间的权衡问题

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了TopoSculpt框架，用于3D管状结构的拓扑细化，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程细化方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构重建的几何和拓扑精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖体素重叠度量，无法捕捉拓扑正确性和完整性；拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局保持或推理时的几何错误纠正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕获完整空间上下文；引入拓扑完整性Betti（TIB）约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；采用持久同调的课程细化方案从粗到细逐步纠正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误从69.00降至3.40（气道）和从1.65降至0.30（CoW），树长检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效纠正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型生成表达性负标签，提升OOD检测性能，在ImageNet基准上FPR95降低4.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假负标签会严重降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLM的理解和推理能力生成表达性负句子，针对近OOD和远OOD分别生成视觉相似负标签和精确表征OOD分布的负句子，设计自适应加权分数平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95达4.2%，建立新的SOTA，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLM生成的自适应负文本空间有效提升了OOD检测性能，特别是在近OOD和远OOD场景下都表现出色，具有很好的适应性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

TL;DR: 提出MMChange多模态遥感变化检测方法，结合图像和文本模态，通过图像特征细化、文本差异增强和跨模态融合模块，显著提升检测精度和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳

Method: 设计图像特征细化模块突出关键区域，使用视觉语言模型生成语义描述，文本差异增强模块捕捉语义变化，图像文本特征融合模块实现跨模态深度整合

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态融合在遥感变化检测中的有效性，提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WSI分类方法在处理空间位置信息和序列长度外推问题上存在不足，特别是基于Transformer的方法需要定制CUDA内核，部署复杂。

Method: 提出位置编码模块利用实例坐标编码空间关系（而非序列索引），SAC块使用MLP结构实现线性时间复杂度的全实例相关性计算，避免了复杂计算需求。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过创新的位置编码和高效的MLP结构，成功解决了WSI分类中的空间关系建模和部署复杂度问题，实现了优异的性能。代码将在接受后发布。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有肝脏血管分割方法依赖对比增强成像数据，但专用成像序列并非普遍采集。无对比增强图像采集更频繁，但血管分割困难且需要大规模标注数据。

Method: 多任务学习框架，利用训练时配对的原始和对比增强MRI数据（有/无血管标注）进行模型训练，通过共享任务结构提升特征表示。

Result: 辅助数据提高了血管分割准确性，即使推理时不可用。在标注数据较少时优势最明显，该方法在脑肿瘤分割验证中也显示跨域优势。

Conclusion: 仅在训练时可用的辅助信息成像模态可以有效增强专家标注，减少对标注训练样本的需求。

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 多模态大模型在多项选择题答题中的提示词设计存在显著敏感性，微小的提示词变化可导致准确率差异达15%。研究提出Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但处理复杂提示能力较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在多项选择题评估中存在提示词敏感性导致的性能评估不透明和不公平问题，模型常通过精心选择的提示词报告最佳性能，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 提出Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个多模态大模型在3个多项选择题基准测试（MMStar、MMMU-Pro、MVBench）中的提示词敏感性。

Result: 专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，反映与指令语义的紧密对齐；开源模型表现更稳定但在处理细致和复杂提示词方面存在困难。不同提示词可导致准确率差异高达15%。

Conclusion: 基于分析结果，提出了针对专有和开源多模态大模型的提示词设计原则，旨在实现更鲁棒和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc是一个基于垂直切片的多模态3D语义占据预测框架，通过全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，并引入SEAttention3D模块为不同高度层分配动态通道注意力权重，显著提升了小物体类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视了高度轴信息，传统SENet式通道注意力对所有高度层分配统一权重，限制了捕捉垂直维度语义变化的能力。

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）沿高度轴提取全局和局部垂直切片特征；2）全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文信息；3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重。

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了平均IoU，特别是在大多数小物体类别上取得了明显增益。消融研究验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc通过充分利用高度轴信息和动态高度层注意力机制，有效解决了3D语义占据预测中垂直维度信息利用不足的问题，为自动驾驶的精确3D感知提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Conclusion: 研究强调了虚假相关性检测的重要性，呼吁在未来的研究中使用这些图像时保持谨慎，并通过乳腺癌分类的案例研究将工作与现实场景相结合。

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的新问题，提出的计数网络和MPEM模块能有效解决该问题，高比例多数类的包有助于学习

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: 通过整合两种研究方向的优势，有效解决了AVVP任务中的噪声放大问题，实现了更好的时序建模和语义信息传播

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVS-PedX是一个用于行人检测和穿越意图分析的神经形态数据集，包含合成和真实世界的事件流数据，适用于不同天气条件，支持事件相机在行人安全领域的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、高动态范围和运动鲁棒性等优势，但缺乏专门针对行人检测和穿越意图分析的数据集，特别是在恶劣天气条件下的数据。

Method: 通过两种互补来源构建数据集：(1) CARLA模拟器生成的合成事件流，控制不同天气和光照条件；(2) 真实世界JAAD行车记录仪视频使用v2e工具转换的事件流。包含配对的RGB帧、事件帧和帧级标签。

Result: 提供了基线脉冲神经网络(SNN)实验结果，展示了数据集的可用性，并揭示了模拟到现实的差距，激励了领域适应和多模态融合的研究。

Conclusion: DVS-PedX数据集旨在加速基于事件的行人安全、意图预测和神经形态感知的研究，为相关领域提供重要的数据资源。

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个新颖的文本到故事可视化框架，通过迭代过程生成多角色故事，保持角色一致性和准确对话分配，解决了现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时难以保持角色一致性，导致生成伪影和不准确的对话渲染，造成故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成逐帧描述、角色细节和对话；采用有界注意力逐框掩码技术控制角色交互；应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性；使用区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置；通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion通过创新的注意力机制和后处理技术，有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的一致性和对话渲染问题，为连贯的故事生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

TL;DR: MEPG是一个多专家规划与生成框架，通过位置-风格感知LLM分解提示，结合空间语义专家模块，显著提升复杂多元素提示的图像生成质量和风格多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示时的困难，以及风格多样性有限的问题

Method: 包含两个核心组件：PSA模块使用微调LLM分解提示为空间坐标和风格指令；MED模块通过动态专家路由实现跨区域生成，支持轻量级专家模型集成和替换

Result: 实验表明MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性方面显著优于相同骨干网络的基线模型

Conclusion: 该框架通过协同整合位置-风格感知LLM和空间语义专家模块，有效提升了复杂多元素提示的生成能力，并提供了良好的可扩展性和交互性

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器在受控数据集上表现良好，但在真实世界基准测试中性能显著落后于商业检测器，需要探索更实用的检测方法

Method: 重新评估Ojha等人提出的方法，使用标准预训练视觉骨干网络，通过改进的超参数调优来生成可泛化的深度伪造检测器

Conclusion: 简单的预训练视觉骨干网络方法经过适当调优后，可以在真实世界深度伪造检测任务中达到与商业检测器竞争的性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 无人机搭载先进传感器为风电设备监测提供了新机遇，但可靠的缺陷检测需要高分辨率数据和高效的多光谱图像处理方法

Method: 开发YOLO-based深度学习模型集成方法，整合通用YOLOv8模型和专用热成像模型，使用复杂的边界框融合算法结合预测结果

Result: 实验显示该方法达到mAP@.5为0.93和F1-score为0.90，优于单独YOLOv8模型的0.91 mAP@.5

Conclusion: 结合多种YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据提供了更可靠的解决方案，改善了视觉和热缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以应对大规模数据集的需求，因此需要开发自动化程度更高的AI辅助标注工具来提高效率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合CLIP与预训练检测器（Ultralytics模型用于常见类别，Grounding DINO用于自定义标签），通过低置信度阈值最大化召回率，并集成Segment Anything进行实时分割，使用WebGPU加速浏览器端计算。

Result: 在COCO类别的测试中，初始预测大部分正确，用户可通过交互工具进行精修。基准测试显示手动工作量减少高达90%，同时通过聚类和IoU图保持高标注准确性。

Conclusion: VisioFirm成功实现了高效的AI辅助图像标注，支持离线操作和多种导出格式，显著提升了标注效率和可访问性，是一个实用的开源解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

TL;DR: DUDE是一种基于特征解缠的无监督跨域图像检索方法，通过文本到图像生成模型分离对象特征和域特定风格，实现语义图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域图像检索方法在整个图像层面进行特征对齐，容易受到域间差异的影响，因为关键的检索对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠在一起。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格；采用渐进式方法在域内和跨域之间对齐互近邻，实现可靠的特征对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐方法有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域间差异问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI定位中难以有效推理适当的图像区域，特别是在高分辨率输入和复杂多元素视觉交互场景下，需要提升模型对关键区域的关注能力和推理步骤分配。

Method: 提出LASER框架，结合蒙特卡洛质量估计和基于IoU的区域质量评估，联合促进高质量偏好数据构建的准确性和多样性，引导模型关注指令相关关键区域并根据任务复杂度自适应分配推理步骤。

Result: 在ScreenSpot Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中取得一致性能提升，在GTA1-7B上微调后在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中获得55.7分，创下7B规模模型的新SOTA。

Conclusion: LASER框架有效提升了视觉语言模型的多步感知能力和坐标预测精度，为GUI定位任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: DMP特征能够为深度学习模型提供关键的形状信息，混合架构设计在遥感图像语义分割中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法在显著弱于现有方法的输入假设下，仍能实现高质量的关节物体重建和表示学习

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context

propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个更真实、人类中心化的基准测试平台，能够更准确地评估大型视觉语言模型的实际地理定位能力，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E是一个基于图像编辑模型（而非文本生成模型）的密集几何估计框架，通过改造DiT编辑器的损失函数和量化方法，在单次前向传播中同时估计深度和法线，实现了显著的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，图像编辑模型比文本到图像生成模型更适合作为微调基础。研究发现编辑模型具有内在的结构先验，能更稳定地收敛并达到更高性能

Method: 将基于DiT架构的高级编辑模型适配到密集几何预测任务，重新制定编辑器的流匹配损失为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计

Result: 无需扩大训练数据，在多个数据集上实现了零样本单目深度和法线估计的显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，性能优于使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架展示了编辑模型在该领域的巨大潜力

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Method: 提出多实例学习框架MICACL，包含GEIIM模块捕获时空依赖关系，WIAN网络动态加权聚合实例特征，以及MCCL对比学习策略平衡类别训练

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法为第一响应者提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够从体戴摄像机视频中自动生成有意义的视觉摘要，显著提高了情境感知和事件分析效率

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Motivation: 基于文本的人员异常搜索面临细粒度跨模态对齐和稀疏样本下异常识别两大挑战，现有大型多模态模型在此任务上的潜力尚未充分探索

Method: 提出粗到细的pipeline，包含无训练适配方法：掩码跨模态提示、行为显著性预测和知识感知重排序，实现零样本异常线索关注

Result: 在PAB数据集上超越竞争基线0.96% Recall@1准确率，展现出文本异常与视觉行为之间的可解释对齐

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM成功将大型多模态模型应用于人员异常搜索任务，为未来研究提供了有效的零样本解决方案

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Motivation: 现有美学图像描述研究主要依赖微调方法，没有专门让多模态大语言模型关注目标美学内容，存在局限性。

Method: 提出了端到端的ASE-MLLM框架，包含图像美学显著性模块(IASM)来提取美学显著性特征，以及IAS-ViT图像编码器通过交叉注意力机制融合美学显著性和原始图像特征。

Result: 在主流美学图像描述基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用多模态大语言模型，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务集成图像美学显著性的框架，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的3D风格迁移方法，利用预训练2D扩散模型的先验知识，通过交叉视图风格对齐和实例级风格迁移，实现高质量3D场景风格化。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D风格迁移方法难以有效提取和迁移参考风格图像的高级语义，且风格化结果缺乏结构清晰度和分离性，难以区分3D场景中的不同实例或对象。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）利用扩散先验生成关键视角的风格化渲染；2）将风格化关键视图转移到3D表示。包含交叉视图风格对齐（在UNet最后上采样块插入交叉视图注意力）和实例级风格迁移两个创新设计。

Result: 广泛的定性和定量实验表明，该方法在从正向视角到挑战性360度环境的各种场景中，显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生更具结构性、视觉连贯性和艺术丰富性的风格化效果，解决了现有方法在高级语义提取和结构清晰度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Motivation: X射线ptychography在纳米尺度分辨率方面具有优势，但现有方法在探针未知情况下重建图像效果不佳，特别是在低剂量和高速实验的低信号条件下，限制了该技术的广泛应用。

Method: 提出Ptychographic隐式神经表示(PtyINR)框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图案进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了卓越的重建质量，在挑战性的低信号条件下表现出显著的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用的、物理信息驱动的框架，可用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，适用于广泛的计算显微镜问题。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步骤从25步减少到1-2步，在A800上实现0.68秒和0.94秒延迟，分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的一致性模型蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画属性迁移，为多属性组合生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理最多四个阴影边界，且不受特定边缘数量的限制，为准直器阴影检测提供了可靠的深度学习解决方案

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一模型评估方法只关注单次的理解或生成能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中是否能保持语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 设计了UCF-UM循环评估协议，交替进行I2T和T2I多代生成，提出三个指标：平均累积漂移(MCD)、语义漂移率(SDR)和多代GenEval(MGG)，并创建ND400基准数据集。

Result: 评估了七个最新模型，发现不同模型的跨模态稳定性差异显著，BAGEL模型能保持语义一致性，而Vila-u模型尽管单次评分高但语义漂移快。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，UCF-UM提供了实用的指标来评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在创意领域的应用增加，需要提供更好的控制、精炼和生成后修改能力，同时保持多帧之间的视觉和叙事一致性。现有方法缺乏灵活性和一致性。

Method: 引入了Plot'n Polish零样本框架，支持一致的故事生成，并在不同细节层次上提供细粒度的故事可视化控制。

Result: 该框架能够实现一致的故事可视化，支持精细和粗略的编辑，同时保持跨多帧的视觉和叙事一致性。

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish解决了现有方法在故事可视化中控制性和一致性方面的不足，为创作者提供了更灵活和一致的故事制作和精炼能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

TL;DR: TRUST-VL是一个统一且可解释的视觉语言模型，用于通用多模态虚假信息检测，通过联合训练和结构化推理链实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态失真）在社会中构成日益严重的威胁，现有方法通常只关注单一失真类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含问题感知视觉放大器模块来提取任务特定视觉特征，并构建了包含198K样本的大型指令数据集TRUST-Instruct，包含与人工事实核查工作流程对齐的结构化推理链。

Result: 在领域内和零样本基准测试中的广泛实验表明，TRUST-VL实现了最先进的性能，同时具备强大的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 不同失真类型共享共同推理能力但需要任务特定技能，联合训练促进知识共享并增强模型泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统虚拟试穿视频生成需要大量计算资源和长视频数据的问题，同时提供生成任意长度视频的灵活性。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成框架，通过前缀视频条件确保局部平滑性，利用360度锚点视频保持全局时序一致性。

Result: 成功生成了分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都保持了局部平滑和全局时序一致性。

Conclusion: VFR是长虚拟试穿视频生成领域的开创性工作，为生成高质量、任意长度的试穿视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局到局部的图像检索范式由于局部匹配计算成本高，只能对少量检索结果进行重排序，而新兴的高效局部特征搜索技术使得大规模详细检索成为可能，但需要更好的重排序方法来提升检索效果。

Method: 提出局部到全局检索范式，使用高效局部特征搜索进行初步检索，然后基于局部特征检索相似性动态生成全局特征进行重排序，利用多维缩放技术创建尊重局部相似性的嵌入表示。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上实现了最先进的检索性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 局部到全局的检索范式结合了高效局部搜索和有效全局重排序的优势，通过动态生成基于局部相似性的全局特征，显著提升了图像检索的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

TL;DR: LuxDiT是一种基于视频扩散变换器的数据驱动方法，通过微调生成HDR环境光照图，在光照估计任务中超越了现有最先进技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像或视频光照估计的长期挑战，克服基于学习方法因缺乏真实HDR环境地图数据而受限的问题

Method: 使用大型合成数据集训练视频扩散变换器，采用低秩适应微调策略提高输入与预测环境图之间的语义对齐

Result: 模型能够从间接视觉线索推断光照，有效泛化到真实场景，生成具有真实角度高频细节的准确光照预测

Conclusion: LuxDiT在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进技术，为光照估计提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: ContraGS是一种在压缩3D高斯分布表示上直接训练的方法，通过使用码本和MCMC采样显著减少内存消耗并加速训练渲染，同时保持接近SOTA的质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS技术使用大量3D高斯分布实现高质量表示，但会导致GPU内存消耗大幅增加，训练和渲染效率降低，需要开发内存高效的训练方法

Method: 利用码本紧凑存储高斯参数向量，将参数估计构建为贝叶斯推断问题，使用MCMC采样从压缩表示的后验分布中采样

Result: 训练峰值内存平均减少3.49倍，训练加速1.36倍，渲染加速1.88倍，同时保持接近SOTA的质量

Conclusion: ContraGS成功解决了在码本压缩表示上直接训练的挑战，实现了内存效率和高性能的平衡

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试使用Perlin噪声分布来模型实际异质散射现象，并通过前向传播方式进行逆散射估计

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Conclusion: 通过将LLM与身体部位文本空间结合，提出了一种新颖的风格化动作生成方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，展示了文本驱动动作生成的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了两种技术的优势，实现了既具有高真实感又能捕捉姿态依赖变形的动态人体化身生成

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Conclusion: 该方法可泛化到卫星图像机器学习的多个应用领域，特别在农业调查数据增强方面具有直接应用价值

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动选择最优数据增强策略，显著提升低精度模型的性能，且与任何KD或QAT算法兼容，训练开销极小

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQuad是一种新颖的联邦学习方法，通过优化类内方差和类间方差来解决数据异质性问题，在CIFAR数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异质性严重影响全局模型的泛化能力，特别是在数据集规模小和类别不平衡的情况下，这个问题更加突出。

Method: 提出FedQuad方法，显式优化较小的类内方差和较大的类间方差，最小化相似对距离同时最大化负样本对距离，在共享特征空间中解耦客户端数据。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，在各种数据分布和多个客户端设置下，FedQuad都展现出优于现有方法的性能表现。

Conclusion: 基于度量学习的策略在监督学习和联邦学习范式中都能有效解决表示学习挑战，FedQuad为处理联邦学习中的数据异质性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: TiM模型通过精确的连续时间动力学方程实现任意步长的状态转换，在保持高效率的同时突破传统少步生成模型的质量天花板，以865M参数超越8B和12B参数的大型模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成建模中的根本困境：迭代扩散模型计算成本高，而高效少步替代方案存在硬性质量上限，这是由于训练目标局限于无穷小动力学或直接端点预测的限制。

Method: 提出精确的连续时间动力学方程，解析定义任意有限时间间隔内的状态转换，构建Transition Models (TiM)生成范式，支持从单步跳跃到多步细化的任意步长转换。

Result: TiM以865M参数在所有评估步数上超越SD3.5(8B)和FLUX.1(12B)等领先模型，实现SOTA性能，并展示随采样预算增加的质量单调改进，在4096x4096分辨率下提供卓越保真度。

Conclusion: TiM通过连续时间动力学框架成功解决了生成效率与质量的权衡问题，为生成模型提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案，在少步和多步场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Motivation: 为运动障碍患者在非结构化环境中提供抓取辅助，解决物体类别和用户意图多样且不可预测的问题。

Method: 采用分层控制框架，整合视觉-语言基础模型和开放词汇机制，实现零样本检测未见物体；多模态决策器融合空间和语言线索推断用户意图。

Conclusion: OVGrasp框架通过多模态交互和开放词汇能力，在非结构化环境中实现了鲁棒的抓取辅助，为运动障碍患者提供了有效的自主性恢复方案。

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人灵巧操作数据收集的挑战，传统遥操作方式效率低且不自然，需要更高效的数据收集方法来提升机器人灵巧性。

Method: 开发DEXOP被动手部外骨骼，机械连接人类手指与机器人手指，提供直接接触反馈和姿态镜像，在自然环境中收集丰富的多模态感知数据。

Result: DEXOP在多种灵巧接触密集型任务中表现出色，相比遥操作显著提高数据收集质量和效率，学习到的策略任务性能更好。

Conclusion: DEXOP通过perioperation范式为机器人灵巧操作提供了高效的数据收集工具，是推进机器人灵巧性的有力手段。

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：LLM理解错误、缺乏外部环境交互和记忆能力缺失，在复杂移动任务上比现有方法提升10.3%

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了当前移动代理的核心问题，在复杂移动任务处理上表现出色，为移动AI助手的发展提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature
missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting
complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary
evolution.
