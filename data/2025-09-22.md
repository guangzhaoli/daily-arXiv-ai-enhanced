### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LLM2VEC4CXR和LLM2CLIP4CXR模型，使用大型语言模型编码器处理噪声放射学报告，提升临床文本理解和图像-文本对齐效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告存在缩写、风格差异和噪声等问题，单纯增加数据量无法提升模型性能，需要更鲁棒的临床表示方法

Method: 开发领域适应的LLM编码器处理胸部X光报告，构建双塔框架耦合视觉主干网络，在160万份CXR研究上训练

Result: 在临床文本理解、缩写处理和风格变化方面优于BERT基线，检索准确率和临床对齐指标显著提升，跨数据集泛化能力更强

Conclusion: 鲁棒性而非单纯的数据规模是多模态学习的关键，模型已开源支持医学图像-文本表示学习的进一步研究

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一个针对视觉语言模型的推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像标记并保持位置信息，使用全局特征向量增强多模态连贯性，实现了VLM推测解码的显著加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术在视觉语言模型中应用不足，只能获得较小的加速效果（<1.5倍），而多模态能力在大规模模型中变得越来越重要，需要解决这一技术空白

Method: 使用轻量级视觉适配器模块压缩图像标记为紧凑表示，整合到草稿模型的注意力机制中；提取全局特征向量增强文本标记的多模态连贯性；通过重新利用现有数据集和修改提示生成扩展输出来创建专门的训练数据集

Result: 实现了视觉语言模型推测解码的首次实质性加速，获得了显著的加速效果

Conclusion: ViSpec框架有效解决了VLM推测解码的挑战，通过创新的视觉信息压缩和多模态连贯性增强技术，为大规模多模态模型的加速推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE是一个多模态合规性评估框架，使用母-子MLLM架构统一处理视觉和文本内容，显著降低人工审核依赖和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架采用分散的多阶段流程，操作开销大、可扩展性差，难以适应动态指南。多模态大语言模型的出现为统一这些工作流程提供了可能。

Method: 提出M-PACE框架，采用母-子MLLM设置：更强的母模型评估较小子模型的输出，实现单次通过评估视觉语言输入。应用于广告合规场景，评估15+合规属性。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍以上，最有效模型（Gemini 2.0 Flash）每张图像成本0.0005美元，而Gemini 2.5 Pro为0.0159美元，精度相当。显著减少人工审核依赖。

Conclusion: M-PACE通过母-子MLLM架构实现了成本与输出质量的有效权衡，为多模态内容合规评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion是一种结合深度学习和原子力显微镜的混合框架，通过虚拟AFM生成合成数据训练扩散模型，实现从单视图AFM图像重建蛋白质复合体3D结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI方法在大型蛋白质复合体结构预测中因缺乏3D空间线索而困难的问题，同时克服实验方法如Cryo-EM成本高、耗时长的问题

Method: 开发虚拟AFM框架生成54.2万蛋白质的多视图合成图像，训练条件扩散模型生成新视角，使用实例特异性NeRF模型进行3D重建

Result: 重建的3D蛋白质结构在AFM成像分辨率内达到平均Chamfer距离，表现出高结构保真度

Conclusion: 该方法在实验AFM图像上得到广泛验证，展示了在准确、经济高效的蛋白质复合体结构预测和快速迭代验证方面的强大潜力

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMEL框架，通过多尺度特征处理和分层语义关系模块增强视觉语言模型的可解释性，在保持高性能的同时提供更精准的视觉解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在安全关键应用中面临挑战，需要提高模型决策的透明度和可靠性，特别是在处理复杂对象关系和细微视觉线索时。

Method: 基于Grad-eclip的梯度解释方法，引入分层语义关系模块，采用多尺度特征处理、自适应注意力加权和跨模态对齐技术。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，MMEL能生成更聚焦和上下文感知的可视化结果，更好地反映模型处理复杂场景的过程。

Conclusion: MMEL框架具有跨领域泛化能力，为需要高可解释性和可靠性的应用提供了有价值的模型决策洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出导航感知剪枝(NAP)方法，针对视觉语言导航任务，通过导航特征预筛选token，显著提升效率同时保持性能，节省50%以上FLOPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在视觉语言导航任务上表现优异但计算成本高，现有剪枝方法未考虑VLN特定挑战，信息损失可能导致更长的导航路径，反而增加计算成本。

Method: 使用导航特定特征预筛选token为前景和背景，基于导航方向过滤图像视图，用大语言模型提取导航相关指令，专注于背景token剪枝，移除低重要性导航节点避免回溯。

Result: 在标准VLN基准测试中显著优于现有方法，保持更高成功率的同时节省超过50%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: NAP方法通过导航感知的token筛选策略，有效解决了VLN任务中剪枝带来的效率与性能平衡问题，实现了显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一个新颖的负责任文本到图像生成框架，通过在扩散模型中间瓶颈表示上应用双模块变换，同时保证公平性/安全性和语义保真度，性能提升20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但确保公平性和安全性仍然是一个开放挑战。现有方法通常在改善公平性和安全性时会牺牲语义保真度和图像质量

Method: 提出RespoDiff框架，包含两个可学习模块：一个负责捕获和执行负责任概念（公平性、安全性），另一个专注于保持与中性提示的语义对齐。引入新的分数匹配目标来协调两个模块

Result: 在负责任生成方面优于最先进方法，确保语义对齐的同时优化两个目标而不损害图像保真度。在多样化未见提示上提升负责任和语义一致性生成20%，可无缝集成到SDXL等大型模型中

Conclusion: RespoDiff提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持高质量图像生成的同时显著改善扩散模型的公平性和安全性，为负责任AI发展做出了贡献

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能提高扩散模型的训练效率和样本效率，发现自动引导能持续提升样本质量和多样性，而早期数据选择在数据效率上可能略有优势但时间开销较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型计算成本高昂，重新激发了高效数据筛选的潜力，研究旨在验证最新开发的自动引导和在线数据选择方法能否改善生成扩散模型的时间和样本效率。

Method: 将联合示例选择(JEST)和自动引导整合到统一代码库中进行快速消融实验和基准测试，在2D合成数据生成和64x64图像生成任务上评估不同数据筛选组合，并在相等墙钟时间和样本数量下进行比较。

Result: 自动引导在所有实验中都能持续提升样本质量和多样性；早期AJEST(仅在训练开始时应用选择)在数据效率上可以匹配或略微超过单独使用自动引导，但其时间开销和复杂性使得在大多数情况下自动引导或均匀随机数据选择更可取。

Conclusion: 虽然有针对性的在线选择在早期训练中可能带来效率提升，但稳健的样本质量改进主要由自动引导驱动；讨论了局限性和适用范围，并概述了数据选择可能有益的情况。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一个基于频域指纹的AI生成图像溯源框架，通过傅里叶变换的径向降维和线性判别分析，实现跨架构和跨数据集的模型溯源，准确率达92.04%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业环境中需要识别AI生成内容的来源模型，用户订阅付费服务时需要保证内容来源的可追溯性

Method: 使用相位增强的径向图像签名映射框架，通过离散傅里叶变换的径向降维利用振幅和相位信息捕获模型特定签名，再通过线性判别分析进行聚类

Result: 在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的溯源准确率，在四个基准测试中平均准确率81.60%，真假图像检测平均准确率88.41%，在GenImage上达到95.06%

Conclusion: 频域指纹技术为生成式AI系统提供了有效的跨架构和跨数据集模型溯源解决方案，有助于增强问责制和信任

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 系统评估多种视觉Transformer模型在心理旋转任务上的表现，发现自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构，中间层表现优于最终层，任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理旋转是人类空间推理的关键测试，但现代视觉Transformer模型是否具备类似能力尚不清楚，需要系统评估这些模型在心理旋转任务上的表现。

Method: 对ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3进行分层探测分析，测试范围从简单的块结构到复杂块图形、三种文本类型和照片级真实物体。

Result: 自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构；中间层表现优于最终层；任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加，与人类反应时间模式相似。

Conclusion: 视觉Transformer模型在心理旋转任务上表现出与人类相似的约束模式，自监督学习和中间层表征对几何结构理解至关重要。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了未经修改的ViT特征在图像分类和分割任务中的内在表示能力，分析了不同token类型和决策规则在不同任务和预训练目标下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对预训练的ViT特征进行额外处理以获得更好的任务性能，但缺乏对未经修改的ViT特征内在表示能力的全面分析。

Method: 使用基于超平面（逻辑回归）或余弦相似度的分类和分割规则，在不使用额外特征变换的情况下，跨token类型、任务和预训练ViT模型进行分析。

Result: 研究提供了关于token类型和决策规则选择的见解，基于任务、上下文和预训练目标，并在两个广泛使用的数据集上报告了详细发现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对未修改ViT特征内在表示能力分析的空缺，为不同任务场景下token类型和决策规则的选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一个主动视觉框架，通过序列化决策过程实现从粗到细的视觉感知，大幅降低计算成本的同时保持准确性，并展现类人视觉行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器视觉模型被动处理整个场景，计算资源需求随分辨率线性增长，限制了实际应用和发展。人类视觉通过选择性注视任务相关区域实现高效感知，这启发了开发主动自适应视觉模型的需求。

Method: 提出AdaptiveNN框架，将视觉感知建模为从粗到细的序列决策过程：逐步识别和关注任务相关区域，跨注视点增量整合信息，在信息充足时主动结束观察。结合表示学习和自奖励强化学习理论，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在17个基准测试（涵盖9个任务）中，实现高达28倍推理成本降低而不损失准确性；灵活适应不同任务需求和资源预算无需重新训练；提供增强的可解释性；在多种情况下展现类人感知行为。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN为高效、灵活、可解释的计算机视觉提供了有前景的途径，同时作为研究视觉认知的潜在工具，展示了类人视觉行为的模拟能力。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff是一个基于级联方法的创新扩散框架，通过从低分辨率到高分辨率逐步生成图像，显著提高了扩散模型的采样效率，在保持或提升生成质量的同时实现了50%以上的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但采样速度慢限制了其实际应用。先前的研究主要集中在模型压缩或减少去噪步骤数量，忽视了在生成过程中利用多分辨率输入的可能性。

Method: 提出LowDiff框架，采用级联方法逐步生成更高分辨率的输出，使用统一模型从低分辨率逐步细化到目标分辨率，适用于像素空间和潜在空间的扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和ImageNet数据集上，LowDiff在保持可比或更好质量的同时实现了超过50%的吞吐量提升。具体指标：无条件CIFAR-10 FID 2.11、IS 9.87；条件CIFAR-10 FID 1.94、IS 10.03；FFHQ 64x64 FID 2.43；ImageNet 256x256 FID 4.00、IS 195.06。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过创新的级联架构设计和生成技术，证明了利用多分辨率输入可以显著提高扩散模型的效率，同时保持生成质量，为扩散模型的实用化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

TL;DR: 提出MaskAttn-SDXL方法，通过区域级门控机制解决文本到图像扩散模型中的组合失败问题，改善多对象提示的空间合规性和属性绑定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在处理包含多个对象、属性和空间关系的提示时，经常出现组合失败，导致实体纠缠、属性混淆和空间线索违反等问题

Method: 在Stable Diffusion XL的UNet中应用区域级门控机制，为每层学习二元掩码，注入到交叉注意力logit映射中，在softmax之前稀疏化token与潜在表示的交互

Result: 提高了多对象提示的空间合规性和属性绑定，同时保持了整体图像质量和多样性，推理路径保持原始且开销可忽略

Conclusion: logit级别的掩码交叉注意力是实现组合控制的数据高效原语，该方法可作为文本到图像生成中空间控制的实用扩展

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN是一个新颖的多域图像到图像转换框架，专门用于种族特征转换，能够在保持个体特征和高层语义的同时映射多个域的风格代码，无需参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GAN模型在种族特征转换方面存在限制：CycleGAN仅限于域对，StarGAN无法映射深度低级风格变化，StarGANv2和StyleGAN需要额外参考图像且无法保持个体特征。

Method: 提出RaceGAN框架，通过多域图像到图像转换技术，在种族属性转换过程中映射多个域的风格代码，同时保持个体性和高层语义，无需依赖参考图像。

Result: 在芝加哥人脸数据集上的测试表明，RaceGAN在亚洲人、白人和黑人种族特征转换方面优于其他模型，通过InceptionReNetv2分类验证了其有效性，并能将潜在空间划分为不同种族群体的聚类。

Conclusion: RaceGAN成功解决了现有模型在种族特征转换中的局限性，实现了无需参考图像的多域风格映射，同时保持个体特征，为种族属性转换提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，现有方法要么局限于局部视觉解释，要么需要大量标注成本的概念解释

Method: 利用有限图像的用户定义部件标签，高效迁移到大数据集，通过聚合基于部件的局部解释来生成全局符号解释

Result: 能够在大规模数据集上提供人类可理解的模型决策解释

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度学习模型可解释性中标注成本高的问题，实现了大规模全局解释

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

Result: 在GAN和扩散模型的溯源任务中优于现有方法，通过因果指纹生成的反事实示例成功实现来源匿名化

Conclusion: 该方法在伪造检测、模型版权追踪和身份保护方面具有强大潜力，验证了因果指纹的有效性

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

TL;DR: 开发了针对神经肿瘤学的专用基础模型，采用分布鲁棒优化方法，显著提高了跨机构泛化能力和罕见分子标志物预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经肿瘤学数据异质性和肿瘤复杂性限制了基础模型的泛化能力，现有模型对罕见分子标志物预测效果不佳，而这些标志物对治疗反应和风险分层至关重要

Method: 在多个机构的脑肿瘤MRI数据上预训练自监督骨干网络（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo），应用分布鲁棒优化（DRO）来减轻站点和类别不平衡问题

Result: 分子预测显著改善，站点特异性嵌入差异减少。CUIMC的平均平衡准确率从0.744提升至0.785，AUC从0.656提升至0.676。在罕见终点上提升最大：CDKN2A/2B准确率0.86到0.92，AUC 0.73到0.92；ATRX AUC 0.69到0.82；Ki-67准确率0.60到0.69。生存预测c-index在所有站点均有提升

Conclusion: 将基础模型与分布鲁棒优化相结合可产生更站点不变的表示，改善常见和罕见标志物预测，增强生存判别能力，强调了前瞻性验证和整合纵向及干预信号的必要性

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: ORCA是一个通过测试时结构化推理提升大型视觉语言模型事实准确性和对抗鲁棒性的代理推理框架，无需重新训练或访问模型内部。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题和对抗攻击脆弱性，限制了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用Observe--Reason--Critique--Act循环，通过查询小型视觉模型进行证据验证，迭代精炼预测结果，并存储中间推理痕迹。

Result: 在POPE幻觉基准上提升性能3.64%-40.67%，对抗扰动下平均准确率提升20.11%，结合防御技术时提升1.20%-48.00%。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠和鲁棒的多模态系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积受限于固定四边形采样区域，无法灵活调整感受野形状，限制了神经网络对复杂图像结构的适应能力。

Method: 每个卷积核元素使用四个边界偏移量来定义矩形采样区域，实现感受野宽度和高度的精确控制，即使使用1x1小卷积核也能捕获局部细节和长程依赖关系。

Result: RAD-Conv将感受野形状与卷积核结构解耦，结合了注意力机制的适应性和标准卷积的效率。

Conclusion: 该设计为构建更具表达力和效率的视觉模型提供了实用解决方案，弥合了刚性卷积架构和计算成本高的注意力方法之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Conclusion: CAGE框架通过边缘中心的几何连续表示和双查询解码器设计，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，实现了鲁棒且精确的平面图重建。

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

### [27] [Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15482)
*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对6种计算病理学基础模型的表示空间进行系统性分析，发现不同训练范式的模型表示结构存在显著差异，染色归一化可降低切片依赖性，视觉-语言模型比纯视觉模型具有更紧凑的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在计算病理学中的发展，虽然已有研究评估模型的任务性能，但对学习表示的结构和变异性了解不足，需要系统分析不同模型的表示空间特征。

Method: 使用计算神经科学中的表示相似性分析技术，基于TCGA的H&E图像块，分析6种基础模型（CONCH、PLIP、KEEP、UNI2、Virchow2、Prov-GigaPath）的表示空间结构、相似性、切片和疾病依赖性、内在维度等特征。

Result: UNI2和Virchow2表示结构最独特，Prov-GigaPath平均相似性最高；相同训练范式不保证更高相似性；所有模型显示高切片依赖性和相对低疾病依赖性；染色归一化降低切片依赖性5.5%-20.5%；视觉-语言模型表示比纯视觉模型更紧凑。

Conclusion: 研究结果为提高对切片特异性特征的鲁棒性、指导模型集成策略提供了机会，揭示了训练范式如何塑造模型表示，该框架可扩展到其他医学影像领域以帮助基础模型的有效开发和部署。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Conclusion: 证明了在现实世界环境中实现高效、可部署的多模态智能的潜力，无需牺牲核心空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法难以准确识别和移除导致后门行为的特定参数，而微调方法虽然性能优越但缺乏可解释性，需要一种既能有效防御后门又能保持模型性能的方法

Method: 提出双层次优化框架，学习选择变量、稀疏可逆掩码和样本特异性后门扰动，内层问题使用逆掩码合成候选触发器，外层问题优化掩码以抑制后门行为

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有剪枝防御方法，在有限数据条件下保持强性能，与最先进的微调方法相比具有竞争力，能有效恢复被攻击样本的正确预测

Conclusion: 该方法通过可逆剪枝掩码机制成功解决了后门防御中的参数识别难题，在保持模型性能的同时有效消除后门，特别适合低数据场景

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

TL;DR: MEC-Quant通过最大熵编码量化方法优化表示结构，解决了量化带来的偏差问题，在极低比特设置下首次实现了与全精度模型相媲美甚至超越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练(QAT)在性能上仍劣于全精度模型，量化会不可避免地引入表示偏差，特别是在极低比特设置下。

Method: 提出最大熵编码量化(MEC-Quant)，利用有损数据编码中的最小编码长度作为熵的计算可处理替代，并基于混合专家(MOE)推导出可扩展的目标函数，实现快速计算并处理权重或激活值的长尾分布。

Result: 在计算机视觉任务上的大量实验证明了其优越性，首次将QAT的极限推至x位激活，准确率与全精度模型相当甚至超越，建立了QAT的新state of the art。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant通过优化表示结构减少量化偏差，在极低比特量化设置下实现了与全精度模型相当的性能，为量化感知训练设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

Motivation: 现有的GUI grounding方法在高分辨率屏幕截图中往往难以实现细粒度定位，需要一种能够自适应处理不同复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 提出GUI-ARP框架，包含自适应区域感知(ARP)和自适应阶段控制(ASC)，采用两阶段训练管道：监督微调+基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化微调。

Result: 7B模型在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到60.8%准确率，在UI-Vision基准上达到30.9%，性能与开源72B模型相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP通过自适应多阶段推理策略有效解决了高分辨率GUI grounding问题，在小模型上实现了与大模型相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Conclusion: SAMPO通过混合建模方法有效解决了世界模型中的视觉一致性和效率问题，为长期决策和规划提供了更可靠的模拟环境

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

Motivation: 现有情感分析方法主要关注文本线索而忽略图像作为补充的非语言线索，多模态方法在人类欲望理解方面研究不足

Method: 使用对称双向多模态学习框架，包括文本引导图像解码器和图像引导文本解码器，采用混合尺度图像策略和掩码图像建模来捕捉局部和全局特征

Result: 在MSED数据集上，欲望理解F1分数提升1.1%，情绪识别提升0.6%，情感分析提升0.9%，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的对称双向多模态学习框架有效提升了欲望、情绪和情感的多模态识别性能，验证了文本和图像模态相互引导的有效性

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Motivation: 现有方法如Sa2VA结合大语言模型和SAM~2进行视频分割，但存在误报问题，需要更好验证查询内容与视频的匹配性并优化帧采样策略

Method: 引入两个核心组件：视频-语言检查器验证查询中的主体和动作是否真实出现在视频中；关键帧采样器自适应选择信息丰富的帧以捕捉早期对象出现和长时序上下文

Result: 在MeViS测试集上获得64.14%的J&F分数，在ICCV 2025第7届LSVOS挑战赛的RVOS赛道中排名第二

Conclusion: 无需额外训练即可显著提升现有方法的性能，通过显式验证和自适应帧采样有效解决了误报和时序建模问题

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何先验和多视图约束的有效结合，成功解决了稀疏视图多外观场景重建的难题，为野外场景重建设立了更现实的基准。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Conclusion: 扩散模型中间特征是多标签分类的强大表示源，不同模态任务存在不同的最优特征提取位置，简单的特征融合就能实现卓越性能

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

TL;DR: Blink-Think-Link (BTL) 是一个受人类认知过程启发的GUI交互框架，通过模拟人眼扫描、认知规划和动作选择三个生物阶段，实现了更自然的人机交互模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的GUI交互自动化系统存在交互逻辑与自然人类行为模式显著偏离的问题，需要更符合人类认知过程的交互框架

Method: 提出三阶段BTL框架：Blink（快速检测和注意力分配）、Think（高级推理和决策）、Link（生成可执行命令）；开发了Blink数据自动标注管道和基于规则的BTL奖励机制

Result: 基于BTL框架开发的BTL-UI模型在静态GUI理解和动态交互任务中均展现出最先进的性能，在综合基准测试中表现一致优异

Conclusion: BTL框架通过模拟人类认知过程有效提升了GUI代理的性能，为开发高级GUI代理提供了实证有效的解决方案

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了显著性目标检测中的尺寸不变性评估框架SIEva和优化方法SIOpt，解决了现有评估指标对大小目标敏感性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性目标检测评估指标存在尺寸敏感性，大尺寸目标的预测误差会主导评估结果，而小尺寸但语义重要的目标往往被忽视，导致评估偏差。

Method: 提出SIEva框架将评估分解为可分离组件单独评估后聚合，并开发了模型无关的SIOpt优化框架，可无缝集成到各种SOD骨干网络中。

Result: 通过理论推导和综合实验验证了方法的有效性，新评估协议能更公平地评估不同尺寸目标的检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的尺寸不变性评估和优化方法解决了SOD领域的根本性问题，为显著性目标检测提供了更公平可靠的评估标准和性能提升方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video
understanding models.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在快速、高频的网球等运动视频理解方面表现不佳，需要专门的基准测试来系统评估模型能力。

Method: 通过自动化流程筛选和生成问题，将每个回合建模为时间有序的连续击球事件序列，涵盖8个回合和击球级别的任务。

Conclusion: TennisTV基准测试揭示了当前MLLMs在网球视频理解方面的局限性，并为改进模型提供了重要指导方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Rasa框架，利用病理报告辅助WSI生存分析，通过LLM提取文本特征，自蒸馏过滤冗余特征，风险感知混合增强数据，在CRC和TCGA-BRCA数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析面临噪声特征和数据可及性限制，病理报告包含丰富患者信息但未被充分利用

Method: 使用LLM从病理报告提取细粒度文本描述，设计自蒸馏管道过滤无关WSI特征，引入风险感知混合策略增强训练数据

Result: 在收集的CRC数据和公开TCGA-BRCA数据上的实验表明，Rasa框架优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Rasa框架有效整合病理报告信息，通过自蒸馏和风险感知混合策略显著提升了WSI生存分析的性能

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PCSR框架，通过伪标签一致性改进跨模态检索中的噪声对应问题，将噪声样本细分为模糊样本和可精炼样本，并采用自适应优化策略提升检索鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索方法假设图像-文本对完美对齐，忽略了真实数据中的噪声对应问题，且传统方法仅简单划分干净/噪声样本，未能充分利用样本特性进行优化

Method: PCSR框架：1）基于置信度估计区分干净/噪声对；2）通过伪标签一致性精炼噪声对；3）提出PCS评分量化预测稳定性；4）采用自适应对优化策略（APO）

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法在噪声监督下提升检索鲁棒性的有效性

Conclusion: PCSR框架通过细粒度样本划分和自适应优化策略，有效解决了跨模态检索中的噪声对应问题，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Motivation: 医学图像分割受隐私限制难以跨机构共享数据，现有联邦学习方法在复杂异构数据上表现不佳，而SAM模型的大规模编码器在联邦设置下面临挑战

Method: 1) 个性化策略：仅聚合全局参数捕获跨客户端共性，保留L-MoE组件保护领域特定特征；2) 解耦的全局-局部微调机制：通过教师-学生知识蒸馏连接全局共享模型与个性化本地模型

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的广泛实验验证，该方法显著提升分割性能，实现强大的跨域适应性，并减少通信开销

Conclusion: 提出的个性化联邦SAM框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的异构数据挑战，平衡了全局共享与本地个性化需求

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Conclusion: UNIV模型通过生物启发的方法成功实现了RGB-可见光和红外模态的有效统一，为多模态感知提供了强大的基础模型解决方案

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale是一个用于3D高斯泼溅的高效训练系统，通过将Gaussians存储在主机内存中并按需传输到GPU，显著降低GPU内存需求3.3-5.6倍，同时保持训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然提供了高质量的图形渲染和快速渲染速度，但在大规模场景训练时面临GPU内存不足的挑战，需要存储大量参数、梯度和优化器状态。

Method: 采用三种系统级优化：(1)选择性卸载几何参数以加速视锥剔除；(2)参数转发将CPU优化器更新与GPU计算流水线化；(3)延迟优化器更新以减少零梯度Gaussians的不必要内存访问。

Result: 在大规模数据集上评估显示，GS-Scale显著降低GPU内存需求3.3-5.6倍，训练速度与无主机卸载的GPU相当，在RTX 4070 Mobile GPU上可将Gaussians数量从400万扩展到1800万，LPIPS提升23-35%。

Conclusion: GS-Scale使大规模3D高斯泼溅训练能够在消费级GPU上实现，解决了内存限制问题，同时保持了训练效率和渲染质量。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,

Conclusion: 结合书法风格和词间距布局的条件扩散模型能够有效提升手写笔画生成的风格模仿能力和生成质量

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受人类扫视视觉启发的两阶段细粒度视觉分类方法，通过外围特征提取和焦点补丁采样来克服现有基于部件方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件的方法存在空间冗余、复杂定位网络限制特征效用等问题，需要一种更有效的细粒度分类方法

Method: 两阶段过程：先提取外围特征生成采样图，然后并行采样和编码焦点补丁，使用上下文选择性注意力加权并融合表示，采用非极大值抑制消除冗余

Result: 在多个标准FGVC基准和挑战性昆虫数据集上达到与最先进方法相当的性能，并始终优于基线编码器

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了细粒度分类中的空间冗余问题，提供了一种更简洁高效的基于部件的分类方案

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D-文本数据集稀缺问题，通过组合单个3D形状构建多对象场景来丰富数据复杂性和多样性

Method: 利用单个3D形状构建具有明确空间关系的多对象场景，通过大语言模型生成连贯的多对象描述，在对比训练中增加结构化组合样本

Result: 在ModelNet、ScanObjNN、Objaverse-LVIS、ScanNet的零样本分类，ShapeNetPart的少样本分割，以及ScanQA的3D视觉问答等多个任务上取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: SceneForge的合成增强方法是模型无关的，能够持续改进多种编码器架构的性能，并展示出强大的空间推理能力

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORIC基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在物体与上下文关系异常情况下的识别能力，发现模型在异常上下文中存在显著的物体误识别和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述、视觉问答等领域取得进展，但在异常上下文中容易出现物体误识别和幻觉错误，需要系统性地评估这一局限性。

Method: 采用两种采样策略：LLM引导采样识别存在但上下文异常的物体，CLIP引导采样检测可能被幻觉的合理但不存在物体，构建异常上下文基准测试ORIC。

Result: 评估18个LVLM和2个开放词汇检测模型，结果显示在异常上下文中存在显著的识别差距，凸显了上下文异常带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LVLM在上下文感知物体识别方面的局限性，为改进模型对异常上下文的处理能力提供了重要见解，鼓励进一步研究上下文感知的物体识别技术。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

Method: 提出了金字塔分词剪枝(PTP)策略，结合自底向上的视觉显著性（区域和token级别）和自顶向下的指令引导重要性，选择性保留视觉显著区域和与多模态任务相关的token

Result: 在13个不同基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算开销和推理延迟，且性能损失极小

Conclusion: PTP是一种有效的训练free解决方案，通过模拟人类视觉注意力机制，在保持多模态理解性能的同时大幅提升高分辨率图像处理的效率

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决AI生成医学影像的安全威胁提供了有效的解决方案，DSKI方法在医学取证领域表现出卓越性能，为医疗系统安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测方法通常构建单一通用判别空间，但这种统一空间往往复杂且脆弱，难以泛化到未见过的生成模式。

Method: 提出TrueMoE框架，包含按流形结构和感知粒度组织的判别专家阵列(DEA)，采用粒度感知稀疏路由和流形感知密集路由的双路由机制，自适应分配输入图像到最相关的专家。

Result: 在广泛的生成模型上进行的大量实验表明，TrueMoE实现了优越的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过多专家协作的方式，TrueMoE有效解决了单一判别空间在合成图像检测中的局限性，为检测任务提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提供了对感受野响应关系的理论理解，还能用于设计更高效的计算方案和构建生物视觉中简单细胞计算的理论模型。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

Result: 观察到由于任务难度增加导致的性能下降，但多光谱模态的整合显著缓解了这种性能退化

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测的未来研究提供了坚实基础，多光谱信息能有效增强检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized

evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

TL;DR: 提出SCOPE框架，结合Cutie和SAM2的优势，通过替换编码器、添加运动预测模块和集成策略，在LSVOS挑战赛MOSEv2赛道获得第三名


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Cutie和SAM2各有局限，Cutie在特征容量方面不足，SAM2在时序建模方面较弱，需要整合两者的互补优势

Method: 将Cutie的编码器替换为SAM2的ViT编码器以获取丰富特征表示，引入运动预测模块提升时序稳定性，并采用Cutie、SAM2和本变体的集成策略

Result: 在第七届LSVOS挑战赛MOSEv2赛道获得第三名，证明了丰富特征表示和运动预测对视频目标分割的有效性

Conclusion: SCOPE框架通过整合互补技术和运动建模，实现了鲁棒的视频目标分割性能，代码已开源

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

TL;DR: SegReg提出了一种基于分割的配准框架，通过解剖学自适应正则化处理区域变化的变形，显著提升了医学图像配准精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准方法使用全局均匀平滑约束，无法处理解剖运动中复杂、区域变化的变形模式

Method: 首先将输入图像分割为解剖学一致的子区域，然后通过相同配准骨干网络计算优化的局部变形场，最后整合为全局变形场

Result: 在使用真实分割时达到98.23% Dice分数，在三种临床场景（心脏、腹部、肺部）中比现有方法提升2-12%的精度

Conclusion: SegReg将配准精度与分割质量建立近乎线性的依赖关系，将配准挑战转化为分割问题

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBPNet提出了一种参数高效的持续学习框架，通过自适应重新初始化未充分利用的参数来解决冻结预训练模型中存在的塑性损失问题，在边缘设备上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人和自动驾驶等应用中对实时动态环境响应的需求，需要适合边缘设备的高效持续学习方法。虽然使用冻结预训练模型和提示已成为主流策略，但这种方法引入了新的关键瓶颈：塑性损失，即模型学习新知识的能力因冻结主干和有限提示参数容量而降低。

Method: 提出了Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet)框架，创新性地集成了高效的CBP块，通过自适应重新初始化训练过程中未充分利用的参数来抵消塑性衰减。该方法仅训练额外参数，这些参数不到主干网络大小的0.2%。

Result: 在边缘设备上的实验结果表明，CBPNet在多个基准测试中表现有效。在Split CIFAR-100上，相比强基线平均准确率提高了1%以上；在更具挑战性的Split ImageNet-R上，达到了69.41%的最先进准确率。

Conclusion: CBPNet通过恢复模型的学习活力，有效解决了冻结预训练模型中的塑性损失问题，为边缘设备上的持续学习提供了一种参数高效的解决方案。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了新的遥感语义变化检测数据集LevirSCD和前景-背景协同引导的FoBa方法，在三个数据集上实现了SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SCD数据集存在类别有限、类型不足、粒度粗糙的问题；现有方法对变化信息利用不足，通常作为后处理步骤，限制了模型性能提升

Method: 构建LevirSCD数据集（16个变化类别，210个具体变化类型，细粒度定义）；提出FoBa方法，利用前景关注感兴趣区域和背景提供上下文信息协同引导；引入门控交互融合模块和一致性损失增强检测性能

Result: 在SECOND、JL1和LevirSCD三个数据集上，FoBa方法相比当前SOTA方法在SeK指标上分别提升了1.48%、3.61%和2.81%

Conclusion: LevirSCD数据集提供了更丰富的细粒度变化标注，FoBa方法通过前景-背景协同引导和门控交互机制有效提升了语义变化检测性能

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

Motivation: 无监督学习中的泛化能力研究较少，现有UDG方法需要域标签，而实际场景中域标签往往不可得。需要一种无需标注就能区分语义和变化的方法。

Method: 基于信息理论，提出最小充分语义表示概念。通过InfoNCE目标实现充分性，使用语义-变化解耦损失和重建机制实现最小性。

Result: MS-UDG在流行的无监督域泛化基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平，持续优于现有的SSL和UDG方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了通过优化充分性和最小性目标可以有效减少分布外风险，为无监督域泛化提供了有效的理论框架和实践方案。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

Motivation: SAM在自然图像领域表现出强大的零样本分割能力，但在遥感数据中面临复杂地形、多尺度对象和时序动态等独特挑战，需要针对性的领域自适应改进

Method: 集成三个轻量级模块：1）地形感知适配器注入高程先验；2）时序提示生成器捕捉土地覆盖变化；3）多尺度融合策略增强细粒度对象划分。无需重新训练SAM主干网络

Conclusion: 该研究展示了领域自适应增强对基础模型的价值，为构建更稳健的地理空间分割提供了可扩展的路径

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL框架有效解决了视频理解的计算效率和关键帧选择问题，显著提升了性能同时降低了计算需求

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Result: CIDER显著减少了显性和隐性偏见，同时保持了图像质量和美学吸引力

Conclusion: 该工作为生成更原创和公平的内容提供了实用解决方案，有助于开发可信赖的生成式AI

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

Conclusion: 该方法任务无关，不依赖特殊训练方式，适用于各种任务，并证明了数据不确定性与任务损失上界密切相关而非具体损失值

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

Conclusion: LC-SLab框架成功解决了稀疏监督下的土地覆盖分类问题，证明了基于对象方法的有效性，为大规模土地覆盖制图提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a

ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

Motivation: 解决图像到点云配准的挑战，包括语义-几何差距、深度模糊性和现有方法容易陷入局部最优的问题。

Method: 1) 通过双路径对比学习构建几何-语义融合嵌入空间；2) 采用粗到精配准范式：全局阶段建立超点-超像素对应关系，局部阶段进行几何约束的点级细化；3) 使用动态训练机制平衡不同损失。

Conclusion: CrossI2P成功解决了跨模态配准的关键挑战，为自动驾驶系统的鲁棒感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and

*Xiaosheng Long,Hanyu Wang,Zhentao Song,Kun Luo,Hongde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap是一种关系感知的检索增强图像描述模型，通过挖掘结构化关系语义和识别异构对象，解决了现有方法在关系建模方面的局限性，以较少的参数实现了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强图像描述方法在关系建模方面存在两个主要问题：语义提示表示过于粗粒度无法捕捉细粒度关系；缺乏对图像对象及其语义关系的显式建模。

Method: 提出RACap模型，从检索描述中挖掘结构化关系语义，同时识别图像中的异构对象，有效检索包含异构视觉信息的结构化关系特征来增强语义一致性和关系表达能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，RACap仅使用10.8M可训练参数，就实现了比先前轻量级描述模型更优越的性能。

Conclusion: RACap通过结构化关系特征挖掘和异构对象识别，有效解决了检索增强图像描述中的关系建模挑战，为复杂场景理解提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个将SAM2视觉基础模型适配到3D点云分割的range-view框架，通过架构修改优化LiDAR距离图像处理，在保持2D流水线效率的同时获得有竞争力的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体素和点基方法计算成本高且实时性有限，而range-view方法可利用成熟的2D分割技术。受视觉基础模型在分割任务中的进展启发，研究SAM2是否可作为LiDAR点云分割的强大骨干网络。

Method: 提出range-view框架适配SAM2到3D分割，耦合高效2D特征提取与标准投影/反投影。对编码器进行三项架构修改：1）强调LiDAR距离图像水平空间依赖性的新模块；2）针对球面投影几何特性的定制配置；3）捕获range-view伪图像独特空间模式的适配机制。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上实现了有竞争力的性能，同时受益于2D中心流水线的速度、可扩展性和部署简便性。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可作为3D感知的通用骨干网络，range-view分割方法使用VFMs可带来有前景的结果，为统一的基础模型驱动LiDAR分割开辟了道路。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

TL;DR: 提出了GREAT框架，通过三个注意力模块（空间注意力、匹配注意力和体积注意力）为现有迭代立体匹配方法注入全局上下文信息，显著提升了在遮挡、无纹理和重复纹理等困难区域的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代立体匹配方法（如RAFT-Stereo和IGEV-Stereo）在遮挡、无纹理和重复纹理等困难区域表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏全局上下文和几何信息来进行有效的迭代优化

Method: 提出了Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)框架，包含三个注意力模块：空间注意力(SA)捕捉空间维度的全局上下文，匹配注意力(MA)沿极线提取全局上下文，体积注意力(VA)与SA和MA协同工作，构建由全局上下文和几何细节激发的更鲁棒的成本体积

Result: GREAT-IGEV在Scene Flow测试集、KITTI 2015和ETH3D排行榜上排名第一，在Middlebury基准测试中排名第二，在所有已发表方法中表现优异

Conclusion: GREAT框架能够有效为现有迭代立体匹配方法注入全局上下文信息，显著提升在困难区域的性能，具有很好的通用性和有效性

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at
https://github.com/JarvisLee0423/GREAT-Stereo.

Motivation: 为了解决静态神经网络架构缺乏动态反馈机制的问题，模仿生物决策过程中的迭代精炼特性，提升模型在噪声环境和小数据场景下的性能

Method: 将反馈过程建模为微分方程，通过循环神经网络求解，并使用指数衰减机制确保收敛稳定性，构建了结合自底向上输入和高级时间表征的状态神经网络

Result: 在目标识别和分割任务中，深度反馈模型在低数据量和高噪声条件下显著优于前馈网络，特别是在医学影像应用中表现出良好的噪声鲁棒性

Conclusion: 反馈机制对于实现稳定、鲁棒和可泛化的学习至关重要，深度反馈模型为神经网络架构设计提供了新的方向

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D目标检测方法需要训练固定类别，限制了应用范围。现有的3D特征融合方法计算成本高且需要3D特定学习。2D领域有更丰富的训练数据可供利用。

Method: 使用预训练的2D基础模型，通过提升2D检测结果并直接优化3D提案，实现跨视角的特征一致性，无需3D特征融合或特定训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在密集采样场景中与最先进技术竞争，在稀疏视角设置下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这种简单而有效的流水线为开集3D目标检测建立了强大的基线，充分利用了2D预训练模型的优势，特别适用于稀疏视角场景。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机-雷达融合为恶劣天气和光照条件下的实时3D目标检测提供了鲁棒且低成本的替代方案，但目前文献中相关研究较少，需要开发新架构来充分利用雷达点云的优势（如精确距离估计和速度信息）。

Method: 提出新骨干网络将雷达柱状特征映射到嵌入维度，使用自注意力机制建模雷达点间依赖关系，用简化卷积层替换PointPillars架构中的FPN卷积层以减少推理时间。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到58.2 NDS指标（使用ResNet-50），同时在该类别中创下了推理时间的新基准。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D目标检测问题上实现了新的最先进性能，证明了相机-雷达融合在实时应用中的有效性，特别是在计算效率和性能方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Method: 提出多时空多光谱产量预测网络MTMS-YieldNet，采用对比学习进行预训练，专注于从遥感数据中捕获空间-光谱模式和时空依赖关系

Result: 在Sentinel-1、Landsat-8和Sentinel-2数据集上分别获得0.336、0.353和0.331的MAPE分数，超越7个现有最先进方法

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet的优异性能不仅提高了产量预测精度，还为农民提供有价值的决策支持，有望改善作物产量

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Motivation: 尽管单目深度估计在现实应用中广泛部署，但其可解释性研究仍然不足，需要建立对MDE模型决策过程的信任和理解。

Method: 在轻量级网络METER和深度网络PixelFormer上应用特征归因方法，通过选择性扰动相关像素来评估解释质量，并引入Attribution Fidelity指标来衡量视觉解释的可靠性。

Result: 实验结果表明，Saliency Maps在轻量级模型上表现良好，Integrated Gradients在深度模型上表现优异，Attribution Fidelity能有效识别不可靠的解释方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为MDE模型提供了有效的可解释性分析框架，证明了不同特征归因方法在不同模型架构上的适用性，并提出了更可靠的评估指标。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Conclusion: 该模型在V2X场景的协同轨迹预测中表现出有效性，能够生成高完整性和准确性的轨迹预测。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的单目深度估计方法，通过混合分布建模像素深度，在物体边界处产生清晰的深度不连续性，显著提高了边界锐度和点云质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在物体边界处往往产生模糊的深度值，引入虚假的3D中间点，而获得清晰边缘通常需要非常精细的监督信息。

Method: 将每个像素的深度建模为混合分布，捕捉多个可能的深度值，将不确定性从直接回归转移到混合权重上。通过方差感知损失函数和不确定性传播无缝集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在KITTI和VKITTIv2数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法实现了高达35%的边界锐度提升，并相比最先进的基线方法提高了点云质量。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用自监督就能产生清晰的深度不连续性，成功解决了单目深度估计中物体边界模糊的问题。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在多种持续学习基线上的广泛实验表明，MuproCL一致地增强了性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导持续学习建立了更有效的路径，通过多原型方法解决了现有方法的根本限制

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，DistillMatch优于现有算法

Conclusion: 通过知识蒸馏利用视觉基础模型的强大特征表示能力，结合模态信息注入和数据增强，有效解决了多模态图像匹配的挑战

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

*Tianyue Wang,Shuang Yang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip是一个用于视觉语音识别的全局-局部集成渐进框架，通过双阶段学习策略解决现实世界中的光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化等视觉挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语音识别方法对现实世界中的视觉挑战关注有限，如光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化等问题需要被有效解决

Method: 提出双路径特征提取架构，集成全局和局部特征，采用两阶段渐进学习：第一阶段学习视觉特征与语音单元的粗略对齐，第二阶段通过上下文增强模块动态整合局部特征与全局上下文

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3基准测试中持续优于现有方法，并在新引入的挑战性普通话数据集上验证了有效性

Conclusion: GLip框架通过渐进学习策略有效利用判别性局部区域，对各种视觉挑战表现出增强的鲁棒性

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

*Stuti Pathak,Rhys G. Evans,Gunther Steenackers,Rudi Penne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字典引导图卷积网络的表面重建方法，能够同时预测控制点的位置和数量，无需点法线即可为噪声点云数据生成平滑表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界点云数据存在噪声，现有数据驱动方法严重依赖真实法线或近似法线计算，对噪声数据不可靠。B样条重建技术虽然提供紧凑表面表示，但现有方法使用固定数量控制点难以匹配底层表面的复杂性。

Method: 开发字典引导图卷积网络，同时预测控制点的位置和数量，无需使用任何点法线来生成平滑表面。

Result: 通过与多个知名和近期基线方法比较，采用广泛使用的评估指标，证明该方法在定性和定量上都优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理噪声点云数据，无需法线信息即可实现高质量的表面重建，解决了现有方法对法线依赖和控制点固定数量限制的问题。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 提出了LIR-GAD框架，使用多模态大语言模型进行群体活动检测，通过引入活动级别和群体特定token来增强语义表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖视觉特征的隐式模式识别，缺乏上下文推理和可解释性，需要更好的语义理解能力。

Method: 扩展MLLM词汇表，引入<ACT>和<GROUP> tokens，结合视频帧和语言指令输入，设计多模态双对齐融合模块整合MLLM隐藏嵌入和视觉特征。

Result: 定量和定性实验均显示该方法在群体活动检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LIR-GAD框架通过语言指导推理有效提升了群体活动检测的性能和可解释性，证明了MLLM在复杂视觉理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖深度或点云等额外模态来改进空间推理，而纯视觉空间理解研究不足，SEE&TREK旨在填补这一空白

Method: 采用最大语义丰富度采样提取关键帧捕捉场景结构，通过模拟视觉轨迹和编码相对空间位置来保持空间关系和时间一致性

Result: 在VSI-BENCH和STI-BENCH上的广泛实验显示，SEE&TREK能持续提升各种MLLM在空间推理任务中的性能，最高提升3.5%

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练和GPU，仅需单次前向传播，可无缝集成到现有MLLM中，为增强空间智能提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲点网络(BSNs)在自监督去噪中牺牲局部细节和引入像素不连续性的问题，以及扩散模型难以适应自监督去噪的挑战。

Method: 提出双分支扩散框架：BSN-based扩散分支生成半干净图像，传统扩散分支捕捉噪声分布；使用BSN分支指导采样过程，在无配对数据下有效训练。

Result: 在SIDD和DND数据集上取得最先进性能，证明该方法作为真实图像自监督去噪的高效解决方案。

Conclusion: Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion框架成功解决了自监督真实图像去噪的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj是一个自适应轨迹预测框架，通过角色和领域感知适配器以及分层对比学习，有效解决多智能体体育场景中的角色异构性和领域分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体体育场景中的轨迹预测面临角色异构性（如球员与球的差异）和不同体育领域间动态分布差异的挑战，现有统一框架难以捕捉这些结构化分布变化，导致跨角色和跨领域泛化性能不佳。

Method: 提出AdaSports-Traj框架，包含角色和领域感知适配器来条件调整潜在表示，并引入分层对比学习目标分别监督角色敏感和领域感知表示，促进解耦的潜在结构而不引入优化冲突。

Result: 在Basketball-U、Football-U和Soccer-U三个多样化体育数据集上的实验表明，该自适应设计在统一和跨域轨迹预测设置中均取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过显式处理域内和域间分布差异，有效提升了多智能体体育轨迹预测的泛化能力，为跨角色和跨领域的轨迹建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

TL;DR: SegDINO3D是一个新的Transformer编码器-解码器框架，用于3D实例分割，通过利用预训练2D检测模型的图像级和对象级特征来提升3D表示性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D训练数据通常不如2D图像数据充足，需要充分利用预训练2D检测模型的表示能力来改善3D表示

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，输入点云和关联的2D图像。编码器阶段通过检索对应视图的2D图像特征来丰富3D点，解码器阶段将3D对象查询表示为3D锚框，并与2D对象查询进行交叉注意力

Result: 在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200基准测试中达到最先进性能，在ScanNet200上分别比先前方法提升+8.7和+6.8 mAP

Conclusion: SegDINO3D通过有效利用2D预训练模型的知识，显著提升了3D实例分割性能，特别是在数据稀缺的挑战性场景中

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D具有优异的检测性能和实时部署潜力，适合自动驾驶应用

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的快速发展使得与人类偏好对齐成为关键挑战，但目前缺乏构建最先进多模态奖励模型的系统指导。

Method: 通过系统实验分析，研究了MRM开发流程中的关键组件，包括奖励建模范式、奖励头架构、训练策略、数据筛选、骨干模型和模型规模以及集成方法。提出了基于Qwen2.5-VL骨干的BaseReward模型，采用优化的两层奖励头架构，在精心筛选的多模态和纯文本偏好数据上训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅提供了一个顶级MRM，更重要的是为社区提供了基于实证的清晰指南，用于开发下一代MLLM的鲁棒奖励模型。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了使用极稀疏飞行时间测量恢复3D参数化场景几何的可行性，为低成本传感器在场景重建中的应用提供了新途径

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在处理以动作和交互为主要语义焦点的复杂场景时存在困难，经常无法捕捉动作描绘中隐含的细微属性，导致生成的图像缺乏关键上下文细节。

Method: 开发了训练免费的知识蒸馏技术，利用大语言模型在三个维度上增强提示信息：时间细节、固有属性和上下文依赖关系，特别发现注入时间细节能显著提升图像生成准确性。

Result: 实验验证领先的T2I模型在AcT2I基准上表现不佳，通过提出的方法最佳模型实现了72%的准确率提升，时间细节的注入对改善效果贡献最大。

Conclusion: 当前T2I方法在需要复杂推理的图像生成方面存在局限，系统性地整合语言知识能够显著推进生成具有细微差别和上下文准确的图像。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在处理图像输入时表现出明显的视觉奉承行为，本文提出反思性调优方法SRT来缓解这一问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MLLMs在处理图像输入时比文本LLMs表现出更显著的视觉奉承行为，即过度迎合用户指令而不考虑正确性

Method: 提出Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT)方法，让MLLM进行反思推理，判断用户指令是误导性还是纠正性后再得出结论

Result: 应用SRT后，模型对误导性指令的奉承行为显著减少，同时不会对纠正性指令表现出过度固执

Conclusion: SRT方法有效缓解了MLLMs的视觉奉承行为，平衡了模型对误导性和纠正性指令的处理能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMRSeg统一模态松弛分割网络，通过层次化自监督补偿解决多模态图像分割中模态缺失/损坏的性能退化问题，在多种缺失模态场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像分割在真实部署中面临模态不完整/损坏导致性能下降的挑战，现有方法需要为每种模态组合训练专门模型，部署成本高且需要模型-模态匹配。

Method: 采用层次化自监督补偿(HSSC)：1)混合随机掩码增强的模态重建学习模态内在特征；2)模态不变对比学习隐式补偿特征空间距离；3)轻量级反向注意力适配器显式补偿弱感知语义；4)混合一致性约束微调确保预测稳定性。

Result: 在MRI脑肿瘤分割、RGB-D语义分割、RGB-D/T显著目标分割等多种缺失模态场景下显著优于最先进方法，性能波动小。

Conclusion: UniMRSeg提供了一种统一的解决方案，有效处理多模态分割中的模态缺失问题，降低了部署成本，具有优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

Motivation: 传统Otsu阈值算法需要进行穷举搜索所有可能的阈值，计算效率低下，在大规模图像处理中存在计算瓶颈

Method: 利用类间方差函数的单峰特性，采用二分法进行优化搜索，替代传统的穷举搜索方法

Result: 在48张标准测试图像上验证，方差计算减少91.63%，算法迭代减少97.21%，66.67%的测试案例获得精确阈值匹配，95.83%的偏差在5个灰度级内

Conclusion: 该优化方法在保持Otsu方法理论基础和分割质量的前提下，显著提高了计算效率，适用于实时应用和大规模图像处理系统

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型在图像理解和生成能力之间存在性能权衡，需要一种统一的框架来同时优化这两种能力。

Method: 采用共享视觉编码器配合两个轻量级适配器，分别生成连续嵌入（用于图像理解）和离散标记（用于图像生成），在共同语义空间中工作。统一的自回归LLM预测文本和图像标记，辅助扩散解码器将图像标记转换为像素。

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Motivation: 传统PnP方法直接在图像域应用去噪器作为先验，本文探索在变换表示（如梯度域）上施加先验的替代方案，扩展TV正则化的概念。

Method: 训练高斯去噪器在梯度域而非图像域操作，开发基于HQS和ADMM的两种分析PnP算法（APnP-HQS和APnP-ADMM）。

Result: 在图像去模糊和超分辨率任务上评估，分析公式达到了与图像域PnP算法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 梯度域PnP方法为图像重建提供了有效的替代方案，将学习先验与变换域表示相结合，性能与传统方法相当。

Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse
problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to
remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is
applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural
images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in
which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such
as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the
gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an
extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization.
To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms,
we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting
(APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We
evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating
that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain
PnP algorithms.

Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer
detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate
capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images,
addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate
capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the
development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal
loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking
into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The
proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal
loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for
proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust
foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are
difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility,
addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability
by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert
and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the
segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the
prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates
superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a
mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results
highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive
techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate
capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve
clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is
essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in
capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global
features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated
deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and

both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for
irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module
(U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and
Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global
representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is
introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive
experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art
methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor
delineation.

Abstract: Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging,
especially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task
faces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition
conditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical
application demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques
have demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in
preserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing
clinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method
based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach
introduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and
a dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps
with original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy
image datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising
performance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency
information. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly
compatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware,

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object
detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it
remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already
demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D

to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into
state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers.
Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance
across various tasks and datasets. Notably, reconstruction-based
self-supervised pre-training outperforms supervised pre-training, while
contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit for 3D medical object
detection. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: SLaM-DiMM通过扩散模型有效解决了MRI多模态数据中的缺失模态生成问题，为下游任务提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted
with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging
(T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different
modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for
understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as
anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are
always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation
a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose
SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the
power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities
from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity
images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume
through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing
anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results. Code is available

Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical
applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation
methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular,
or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on
spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of
frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ
segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block
(MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet
framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture
both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing
complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block
utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel
attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information,
and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental
validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other
recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD
of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the
average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the
accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.

Abstract: The original Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their modern updates
such as the ResNet are heavily inspired by the mammalian visual system. These
models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and
long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas).
However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each
visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would
roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important
architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we
present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN
framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in
relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main
architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2)
separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN
using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom
loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of
these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the
activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show
properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect
our approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better
understand the principles of visual cortical computation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 将静态神经表面重建方法NeuralAngelo扩展到动态场景，通过高质量模板重建和联合优化变形场，实现高精度动态重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态重建方法主要关注新视角合成，提取的网格质量较差，而追求几何保真度的方法往往因问题不适定性导致网格过于平滑

Method: 首先使用NeuralAngelo从初始帧重建高质量模板场景，然后联合优化变形场来跟踪模板并根据时间序列进行细化，灵活模板可更新几何以包含变形场无法建模的变化

Result: 在ActorsHQ数据集上相比现有最先进方法展现出优越的重建精度

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了动态场景重建中的计算和表示挑战，实现了高质量的几何细节重建

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction
methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending
these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces
significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic
methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend
to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too
smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel
framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D
reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we
start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame
using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the
template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template
allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the
deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology.
We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous
state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset.

TL;DR: CoReVLA是一个持续学习的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过数据收集和行为精炼两阶段过程，在长尾安全关键场景中提升了性能表现，在Bench2Drive基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中表现有限，这些罕见情况导致了不成比例的事故数量。现有视觉语言动作模型虽然具备强大推理能力，但受限于高质量数据缺乏和学习效率低下。

Method: 采用双阶段过程：首先在开源驾驶问答数据集上联合微调获得基础场景理解，然后在CAVE模拟平台中收集驾驶员接管数据（指示长尾场景失败），最后通过直接偏好优化(DPO)从人类偏好中学习，避免人工设计奖励的奖励黑客问题。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CoReVLA获得72.18的驾驶评分和50%的成功率，在长尾安全关键场景下分别比最先进方法高出7.96分和15%。案例研究显示模型能够利用过往接管经验持续改进类似易失败场景的性能。

Conclusion: CoReVLA框架通过持续学习和人类偏好优化，有效提升了自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中的可靠性和性能，为解决罕见但重要的事故场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All

TL;DR: 提出基于Kuramoto同步动力学的周期性域扩散模型，用于生成具有角度方向模式的结构化图像，在指纹和纹理等方向密集数据上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统各向同性欧几里得扩散难以有效建模指纹和纹理等具有相干角度方向模式的图像，受生物系统中相位同步现象的启发

Method: 利用随机Kuramoto动力学构建基于周期性域的分数生成模型，前向过程通过全局/局部耦合振荡器相互作用实现同步，反向过程进行去同步生成

Result: 在通用图像基准上取得竞争性结果，在指纹和纹理等方向密集数据集上显著提升生成质量

Conclusion: 生物启发的同步动力学作为生成模型中的结构化先验具有很大潜力

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出GPLASC方法，通过全局预固定和局部调整策略，在对比持续学习中同时解决任务间和任务内特征混淆问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比持续学习方法因任务间和任务内特征混淆而性能受限，需要同时确保任务间和任务内的判别性特征结构

Method: 将表示空间划分为非重叠区域，使用等角紧框架(ETF)预固定任务间中心，同时在各自区域内形成任务内可调整ETF

Result: 广泛实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: GPLASC能无缝集成到现有对比持续学习框架中，同时确保任务间和任务内的判别性特征结构

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: LZN是一种统一处理生成建模、表示学习和分类任务的框架，通过创建共享高斯潜在空间和分区编码器/解码器实现多任务协同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中生成建模、表示学习和分类任务解决方案相互独立的问题，寻求统一原则简化ML流程并促进任务间协同

Method: 构建共享高斯潜在空间，为不同数据类型（图像、文本、标签）配备编码器和解码器，将ML任务表示为这些组件的组合

Result: 在三个场景中表现优异：1) 结合Rectified Flow模型将CIFAR10 FID从2.76提升至2.59；2) 无监督表示学习超越MoCo和SimCLR；3) 同时实现生成和分类任务，在CIFAR10上达到SOTA分类精度

Conclusion: LZN展示了统一框架处理多ML任务的潜力，为简化ML管道和促进任务间协同提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗健康领域的几何感知联邦学习设定了新标准，将高级数学转化为可行的解决方案，在保持严谨性的同时确保临床相关性，为敏感医疗数据分析提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced
communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods.
Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new
standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced
math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

Result: 在分类、回归和预测任务的综合评估中，该方法相比竞争基线实现了持续且优异的性能

Conclusion: DMAE通过联合优化多个目标，能够学习到时序连贯且语义丰富的表示，为无监督时间序列表示学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

TL;DR: DiffusionNFT是一种新的在线强化学习范式，通过流匹配直接在正向过程中优化扩散模型，避免了传统方法的问题，实现了25倍效率提升，无需分类器自由引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线强化学习方法在扩展到扩散模型时面临似然不可处理、求解器限制、正反向不一致性以及与分类器自由引导集成复杂等问题。

Method: 提出DiffusionNFT方法，通过流匹配在正向过程中直接优化扩散模型，对比正负生成来定义隐式策略改进方向，将强化信号自然融入监督学习目标。

Result: DiffusionNFT比FlowGRPO效率提升25倍，在1k步内将GenEval分数从0.24提升到0.98，无需CFG。使用多个奖励模型显著提升了SD3.5-Medium在所有基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT为扩散模型提供了一种高效、灵活的在线强化学习范式，解决了传统方法的根本缺陷，实现了显著的性能提升和效率改进。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG使用静态指导尺度，无法适应不同提示词的多样性需求，现有解决方案复杂且缺乏泛化能力

Method: 利用CLIP对齐、判别器保真度和人类偏好奖励模型等潜在空间评估进行在线反馈，通过贪心搜索为每个时间步选择最优CFG尺度

Result: 在Imagen 3上实现53.8%的人类偏好胜率，在文本渲染等特定能力上达到55.5%的胜率，显著提升文本对齐和视觉质量

Conclusion: 最优指导尺度本质上是动态且提示相关的，该方法提供了高效且可泛化的实现框架

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability
to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches
primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual
abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of
dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support
this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset
comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset,
we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal
sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations.
Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video
frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile
consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning,
and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint
integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose
a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of
dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.
