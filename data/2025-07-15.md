### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VIL的视图不变学习策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）在连续环境中的鲁棒性，特别是在相机视角变化的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的导航策略对视角变化（如相机高度和视角的变化）敏感，影响了导航性能。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视图不变的特征，并引入教师-学生框架优化Waypoint Predictor模块。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE任务中，成功率比现有方法提高了8-15%，并在标准VLNCE设置下也表现优异。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，既能提升视角变化的鲁棒性，又不影响标准视角下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的深度学习检测技术，用于识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术容易被用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式进行检测，并在大规模数据集上评估。

Result: 技术能够有效检测多种深度伪造技术，并对未知生成器具有一定泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该技术为深度伪造视频的检测提供了可靠的工具，尤其在对抗视频洗白和未知生成器方面表现良好。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据和任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型中的隐性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）常继承并放大训练数据中的偏差，导致预测偏差。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）使用对比式去偏差损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏差方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效且无需外部数据的去偏差解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HMR-ViT方法，结合时空和运动学信息，通过Vision Transformer提升人体网格恢复精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，未结合两者，限制了性能。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图，使用CRM优化特征排列，Vision Transformer编码后回归SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了HMR任务性能。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合NeRF与MPM模拟，通过视觉观测推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无法直接测量的情况下，通过视觉观测表征颗粒材料特性的问题。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，利用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟初始化材料点位置，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料的视觉表征提供了可行方案，适用于实际场景中的间接测量。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提高多模态基础模型生成标签的数据质量，通过多阶段验证策略和人工干预解决隐藏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法更关注数据量而非质量，缺乏对大规模无真实标签数据的有效验证手段。

Method: VISTA结合多阶段数据验证策略和人工专业知识，识别并修正标签中的问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割任务中，VISTA通过定量和定性分析证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA能显著提升多模态模型生成标签的质量，从而增强下游任务性能。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过引入两种对比损失函数，提升尾部类别图像的多样性，同时保持头部类别图像的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类别不平衡数据中尾部类别图像多样性不足的问题，避免模式崩溃。

Method: 使用无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，对比条件与非条件生成，增强尾部类别的多样性。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于标准DDPM和其他方法，提升了尾部类别的图像多样性。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，适用于类别不平衡的扩散模型。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了‘无限视频理解’作为多媒体研究的新前沿，探讨了处理超长视频的核心挑战和研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态扩展在视频理解方面取得进展，但处理超长视频时仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。

Method: 通过分析现有技术（如Video-XL-2、HoPE等）的局限性，提出‘无限视频理解’的概念，并探讨其研究方向。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了实现无限视频理解的关键挑战和潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是一个雄心勃勃但逻辑合理的研究目标，将为多媒体和AI领域带来创新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight通过利用注意力稀疏性优化VLM推理，减少FLOPs 32%-41%，精度变化在±2%内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据扩展了提示长度，导致预填充时间增加，需解决注意力计算的瓶颈。

Method: 分析VLM注意力模式，提出基于输入模板的稀疏注意力掩码BlindSight。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上，FLOPs减少32%-41%，精度变化小。

Conclusion: BlindSight有效优化VLM推理，保持精度同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 展望了下一代基础模型的发展方向，强调统一建模能力、跨域泛化和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的方法，通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型来提取光流，利用KL-tracing技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光流提取是计算机视觉的核心问题，但现有方法需要微调且依赖稀缺的标注数据。论文探索了是否可以通过提示冻结模型来避免这些问题。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，提出KL-tracing技术，通过注入扰动并计算预测分布的KL散度来提取光流。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上分别实现了16.6%和4.7%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示可控生成视频模型是一种高效且可扩展的光流提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究卷积神经网络内部机制及其推理原因，特别是在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上优于部分现有方法，与最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: MI CAM能提供无偏见的模型推理解释，适用于关键领域，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo利用放射科医生的眼动视频序列提升LVLMs在胸片分析和报告生成中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的时序信息，而RadEyeVideo通过视频序列整合时空动态，以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频输入，结合通用LVLMs进行评估。

Result: 模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学LVLMs。

Conclusion: 有效整合专家知识（眼动信息）可显著提升通用模型在临床任务中的能力，RadEyeVideo为医学影像分析提供了可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于数据集规模，而SD模型在大规模数据上训练，具备更强的能力，可用于提升3D自监督学习。

Method: 提出PointSD框架，将SD模型的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云到图像的扩散模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D主干网络。

Conclusion: PointSD成功利用SD模型增强3D表示学习，为3D自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成，解决了传统方法的误差累积和实时性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免误差累积，而扩散模型虽能高质量生成但不适合实时任务。

Method: 结合自回归和扩散模型，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法的生成质量和实时效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法在手语生成中表现出色，兼具高质量和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明SAMPL优于现有方法，显著提升了模型在干扰条件下的性能。

Conclusion: RoHOI为HOI检测的鲁棒性研究提供了新基准，SAMPL策略为模型优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.
Benchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: MG-CLIP通过保持和补偿模态间隙提升CLIP在持续学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作忽视了CLIP中的模态间隙，而这是影响其泛化和适应性的关键因素。

Method: 提出MG-CLIP方法，利用模态间隙保持减少遗忘，通过补偿增强新数据学习能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙为持续学习提供了新视角，MG-CLIP简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++显著提升了文本-动作生成的细粒度控制和泛化能力，为长期动作生成和混合研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM是一种基于LLM的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于LocLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；LocLLM的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: 用非线性MLP替换线性投影器，实现跨模态特征分层融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM 0.4 AP，同时在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 简单但强大的非线性连接器显著提升定位精度，不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的进展。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的4D占用预测框架$I^{2}$-World，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态表达和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂3D场景的标记化挑战，以预测场景演化和生成未见场景。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合编码器-解码器架构，实现高效4D占用预测。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别提升25.1%和36.9%，训练内存仅需2.9GB，实时推理达37.0FPS。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的场景预测工具。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score依赖复杂的辅助结构，导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑受限，SSD旨在简化框架并提升编辑过程的稳定性和对齐性。

Method: SSD通过锚定单一分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项null-text分支稳定优化过程。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务中（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）取得了最先进的结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，保持了原始内容结构并确保编辑轨迹与源提示紧密对齐。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Result: LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最优性能，显著提升了知识保留和增量学习能力。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示解决了令牌维度饱和问题，为FSCIL任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA有效缓解图像对齐偏差，提升多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Method: 提出Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)方法，结合层次特征聚合和循环时间细化，建模多尺度空间上下文并保持时间一致性。

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了地面和空中场景的理解能力。

Conclusion: THYME方法通过改进空间和时间建模，显著提升了动态场景图生成的性能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了新方法，解决了开放场景中的泛化问题。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be

inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

### [31] [Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217)
*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线点跟踪方法Track-On，基于Transformer架构，无需未来帧信息，在七个公开基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期点跟踪方法多为离线模式，依赖未来帧信息，而实际场景（如流媒体、具身AI）需在线因果预测。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理能力。

Method: 提出Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点视为查询，逐帧处理视频，利用Transformer架构维护时序一致性。

Result: 在七个公开基准测试中达到新SOTA，验证了无需未来信息的长期跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: Track-On证明了在线长期点跟踪的可行性，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

TL;DR: StaRFM框架通过Fisher信息惩罚和置信度对齐惩罚，解决了基础模型在分布偏移和置信度失准问题，提升了视觉和医学任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如CLIP和SAM在低样本迁移学习中表现出色，但面临分布偏移和置信度失准问题，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包含Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP），分别处理分布偏移和置信度校准问题。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中，StaRFM显著提升了性能（如准确率+3.5%，ECE降低28%，DSC达84.7%）。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的统一框架，可无缝集成到基础模型中，显著提升跨域性能。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

*G. Kutay Türkoglu,Julian Tanke,Iheb Belgacem,Lev Markhasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的方法，从单张第一人称视角图像重建可动画的虚拟形象，减少了训练负担并提高了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理想的数字远程呈现需要准确复制人的身体、服装和动作。第一人称视角虽然便携且成本低，但存在遮挡和身体比例扭曲的挑战。现有方法多依赖多视角数据集训练，缺乏基于生成先验的方法。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出了一种从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入到图像到运动模型中。

Result: 该方法能够从单张俯视图像生成虚拟形象的运动，为更易用和泛化的远程呈现系统铺平道路。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用生成主干从第一人称输入重建可动画虚拟形象的研究，结合生成先验和图像到运动模型，推动了远程呈现技术的发展。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算创造力和艺术教育提供了新见解。

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Motivation: 传统情感识别方法存在上下文偏见问题，如背景与情感标签的虚假关联。

Result: 在CAER-S数据集上达到最优性能，验证了因果去偏的有效性。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过因果去偏显著提升了复杂场景下的情感识别效果。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

TL;DR: AAHR框架通过动态聚类原型对比学习和多模态关系矩阵，解决了图像-文本匹配中的语义模糊和高阶关联问题，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理相似实例的高阶关联和语义模糊时表现不佳，尤其是软正负样本的区分和邻域关系的利用不足。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互以及动量对比学习。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上，AAHR优于现有方法，提高了匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR通过综合策略有效解决了语义模糊和高阶关联问题，为图像-文本匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无注释手语翻译方法因模型复杂性和高计算需求导致的扩展性问题。

Method: 采用分段感知视觉标记化框架将连续视频转换为离散标记，并引入token-to-token对比对齐目标和双级监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中表现优于现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算需求的同时提升了性能，验证了标记化和对齐策略的潜力。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Result: 在N-Caltech101和CEP-DVS数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CKD方法有效提升SNN性能，代码开源。

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: MLLMs在医疗等安全关键领域的应用受到两个主要限制：对提示设计的敏感性和高置信度错误回答的倾向。这可能导致临床决策中的信任问题。

Method: 提出Prompt4Trust框架，通过训练一个轻量级LLM生成上下文感知的辅助提示，指导下游任务MLLM生成置信度更准确的回答。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了自动化且与人类对齐的提示工程在提高MLLMs在安全关键领域可信度方面的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Result: 在两个标准基准测试中表现优异，召回率显著提升，且能轻松整合额外元数据以提高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合语义信息，显著优于现有方法，展示了语义信息在定位任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet为少样本分类提供了强大且灵活的方法，并成为Transformer元学习的新基准。

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Motivation: 路径平滑性在专家演示的路径模仿学习中常被忽视，本文旨在通过自适应路径平滑性提升路径相似性。

Method: 结合PAF到A*算法中，通过路径缩短和平滑的联合优化，实现路径最优性。

Result: 在7个数据集上评估，DAA*在路径相似性和长度上优于现有方法，如神经A*和TransPath。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和相似性上表现优异，但需权衡路径最优性和搜索效率。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALPHA是一个新的RGBA基准测试，结合了ALPHAVAE模型，用于透明图像生成，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在透明或分层内容（RGBA图像）生成方面研究不足，缺乏大规模基准测试。

Method: 提出ALPHA基准测试和ALPHAVAE模型，通过alpha混合和复合目标训练，优化RGB和alpha通道表示。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅8K图像训练下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提升3.2%，生成效果优于LayerDiffuse。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE在透明图像生成中表现优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

*Yueqian Wang,Xiaojun Meng,Yifan Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ProactiveBench，首个评估多模态对话系统主动交互能力的基准，并提出了考虑时间动态的PAUC指标，优于传统评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户期望多模态系统更具主动性，如实时决定视频播放中的多轮响应时机，需新评估方法。

Method: 提出ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，结合时间动态评估系统主动交互能力。

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确评估主动交互场景的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

*Kaixuan Cong,Yifan Wang,Rongkun Xue,Yuyang Jiang,Yiming Feng,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICCAE是一种动态调整类间混淆损失的音频-视频编码器，通过细粒度对齐增强模型区分相似活动的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失；引入多模态训练框架；提出聚类引导的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近SOTA。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过动态混淆损失和自监督预训练有效提升音频-视频分类性能，各模块均被验证为必要。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast3D是一个用于3D多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过全局注意力预测和样本自适应剪枝技术提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D MLLMs在场景理解方面表现出色，但计算效率低，主要瓶颈在于处理过多的对象中心视觉令牌。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包含全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应剪枝（SAP）技术，无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其是在高视觉令牌剪枝比例下表现优异。

Conclusion: Fast3D通过高效剪枝技术显著提升了3D MLLMs的计算效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 简单编码器架构结合预训练在交通异常检测中表现优异，超越复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练是否能让简单架构在交通异常检测中超越复杂方法。

Method: 使用Video ViTs作为编码器，研究不同预训练方法（弱监督、全监督、自监督MVM和DAPT）的效果。

Result: 自监督MVM和DAPT预训练表现最佳，简单架构匹配或超越复杂方法。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合预训练可实现高效、可扩展的交通异常检测。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: 在CMU-Mocap、MuPoTS-3D和3DPW数据集上性能最优，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 高效时空设计实现了高性能和低计算成本的多人物运动预测。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过知识对齐和自适应聚合提升了模型鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

TL;DR: HMID-Net结合掩码图像建模和知识蒸馏在双曲空间中高效训练模型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和语义概念通常具有层次结构，现有方法MERU在双曲空间中捕捉这种结构，但训练效率有待提升。

Method: 提出HMID-Net，在双曲空间中整合掩码图像建模和知识蒸馏技术，并设计专用蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP。

Conclusion: 双曲空间中的MIM和知识蒸馏技术能高效捕捉层次结构，并在下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个专门设计用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正理解视频的基准测试，强调全面的视频理解，而非静态图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试往往类似于基于图像的测试，模型仅需扫描关键帧即可回答问题，无法评估LVLMs是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个高度视觉中心的问题，涵盖11个类别，所有问题需观看完整视频并进行推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM模型（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，显示LVLMs在深度视频理解上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在真正理解视频方面的不足，需进一步改进以超越表面推理。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验显示，该方法在精度和模型参数上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN的组合为高光谱图像分类提供了高效、实时的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的情况下，面对分布偏移时性能下降。现有缓存方法因熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活而面临挑战。

Method: 提出ReTA方法，包括一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC），分别解决熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活的问题。

Result: ReTA在实验中表现优于现有方法，尤其在真实世界分布偏移下效果显著。

Conclusion: ReTA通过两种互补策略有效提升了视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for

TL;DR: HFUT-VUT团队提出了一种用于微手势在线识别的新方法，通过数据增强和时空注意力机制，显著提升了性能，并在IJCAI 2025 MiGA挑战赛中排名第一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势在线识别任务具有挑战性，需要准确定位和分类视频中的微手势实例，且微手势与其他人类动作差异较大。

Method: 采用手工数据增强和时空注意力机制，提升模型的分类和定位能力。

Result: F1分数达到38.03，比之前的最佳方法提升了37.9%，在比赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势在线识别任务中表现优异，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等SSM模型中空间冗余问题，提升效率而不显著影响准确性。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余激活和最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上也表现良好。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的高效工具，适用于SSM模型，优于传统token合并方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

*Yunwei Lan,Zhigao Cui,Xin Luo,Chang Liu,Nian Wang,Menglin Zhang,Yanzhao Su,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB是一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，通过最优传输理论和细节保留正则化提升去雾效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 利用最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，结合细节保留正则化和CLIP模型的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的标记化策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，并在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉标记化方法效率低下。

Method: 采用内容感知标记化策略，分阶段训练，分离空间区域检测与语义特征提取。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，零样本评估中F1分数提升5.5点，图像标记减少3.6倍。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: DRPCA-Net是一种基于动态展开网络的深度学习方法，通过结合稀疏先验和动态参数调整，显著提升了红外小目标检测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于依赖复杂架构，忽视了目标稀疏性的固有先验，导致模型效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过轻量级超网络动态生成迭代参数，并结合动态残差组（DRG）模块优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法，检测精度更高。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态展开机制和稀疏先验的结合，为红外小目标检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于光学镜头焦距和红外探测器分辨率的限制，远距离CSIST群在红外图像中通常表现为混合斑点，缺乏高质量数据集也阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出了Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet)，包含Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA)模块，实现帧间信息自适应聚合。

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的mAP指标比现有方法提高了5.3%。

Conclusion: 论文首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务，并提供了数据集和工具包以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了TIP和手腕关节的重要性，且未解决远端关节误差累积问题，导致姿态估计质量下降。

Method: EHPE分为TW阶段（提取TIP和手腕关节）和PG阶段（通过双分支交互网络优化其余关节位置）。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段处理TIP和手腕关节，有效减少了误差累积，提升了整体手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available
at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，现有生成模型缺乏交互性，无法满足局部编辑和灵活提示的需求。

Result: 系统支持高质量、多语言的艺术字体生成，显著提升交互性和创意可能性。

Conclusion: WordCraft为艺术家和设计师提供了更灵活、高效的艺术字体创作工具。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Conclusion: MENTOR在多模态图像生成中实现了高效、可控的生成，且具有广泛的任务适应性和训练效率优势。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在复杂手术视频分割中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式分割方法在密集令牌处理上存在速度与精度的权衡，Inter2Former旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出动态提示嵌入（DPE）、动态混合注意力（DHA）、混合专家（HMoE）和动态局部上采样（DLU）四种改进。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former实现了SOTA性能，并在CPU设备上高效运行。

Conclusion: Inter2Former成功平衡了交互式分割的速度与精度，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度分类中无法捕捉动态的类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FAIR通过类描述锚点动态对齐特征，提出学习对齐分数和自训练加权机制。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法平均提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过改进跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常检测样本稀缺，现有异常合成方法存在低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA利用局部概念分解联合建模异常语义特征和空间信息，通过自适应多轮异常聚类增强表示一致性，并采用区域引导掩码生成策略确保对齐。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA通过少样本生成高质量异常样本，显著提升了异常检测任务的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Result: 所有模型在DR预测中表现优异（最高94% AUROC），但对年龄和性别的预测存在差异（91%和77% AUROC）。解缠技术效果因模型而异，DINOv2性能提升2%，其他模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了眼底图像中解缠细粒度特征的复杂性，强调了医疗影像AI中公平性的重要性，以确保公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升眼部分割和注视估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对token压缩技术的系统分类和比较，且未验证其在紧凑型ViT上的有效性。

Method: 提出了首个系统分类和比较研究，并在标准和紧凑型ViT架构上评估了代表性技术。

Result: 实验表明，token压缩技术在通用ViT中有效，但在紧凑型设计中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在边缘AI中优化紧凑型Transformer提供了实践指导和研究方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Motivation: 传统VSD方法在实践中存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题，主要原因是LoRA与3D分布不匹配。

Result: 实验表明L²-VSD优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到其他VSD框架中。

Conclusion: L²-VSD通过改进优化顺序和线性化技术，显著提升了文本到3D生成的稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了碎片兼容性计算的性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种改进的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，解决了现有方法因负标签不准确导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负标签方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，尤其是负标签为ID标签的子类或专有名词时。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数动态调整匹配标签的贡献。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现出更鲁棒的ID和OOD样本分离能力。

Conclusion: NegRefine通过负标签细化和动态评分机制，显著提升了零样本OOD检测的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

Method: 构建了包含1K真实事故视频和6K多选问答对的VRU-Accident基准，评估了17种最先进的MLLMs。

Result: MLLMs在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在推理事故原因、类型和可预防性方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在VRU安全场景中的空白，揭示了其推理能力的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Result: 点变换器模型在全局形状表征上更接近人类表现，优于卷积模型。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型的层次抽象机制使其在3D形状识别中更接近人类视觉系统。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

*Yongheng Zhang,Xu Liu,Ruihan Tao,Qiguang Chen,Hao Fei,Wanxiang Che,Libo Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTCoT是一种新的视频推理范式，结合视觉和文本信息，显著提升视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在推理时会重新审视视觉内容，而现有方法主要依赖文本信息，忽略了视觉模态。

Method: 提出Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT)范式，并构建Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)。

Result: ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并激活更多MLLM神经元。

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频理解领域提供了更直观且认知对齐的推理方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出首个4D人体解析框架，通过减少推理时间并引入开放词汇能力，解决了现有方法依赖封闭数据集和推理时间长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D人体表示在虚拟和扩展现实应用中日益重要，但现有方法受限于封闭数据集和长推理时间。

Method: 基于开放词汇3D人体解析技术，引入掩码视频对象跟踪、掩码验证模块和4D掩码融合模块。

Result: 实验显示方法在4D人体解析任务中有效且灵活，推理速度提升至93.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了4D人体解析的效率和适用性。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

TL;DR: CECAS框架通过因果引导的对抗方法生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素干扰，提升解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 提出CECAS框架，结合因果视角生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素扰动。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、邻近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果整合显著提升反事实解释质量，为模型可解释性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

*Zhanjiang Yang,Lijun Sun,Jiawei Dong,Xiaoxin An,Yang Liu,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCGA提出了一种两阶段方法，通过先学习光谱模式再估计映射，解决了RGB到HSI转换的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息转换的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA使用多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，并通过灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力优化重建质量。

Result: 实验表明MCGA实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过引入先验知识和高效注意力机制，显著提升了HSI重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中物体的任意方向性使得旋转等变性成为关键特性，但目前研究较少，且现有方法多为近似旋转等变。

Method: 实现严格旋转等变的骨干和颈部网络，并利用旋转等变特征的分组特性设计多分支头网络。

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变性对航空图像目标检测有显著提升，多分支头网络能有效减少参数并提高精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图形设计方法缺乏创造力和可编辑性，导致设计过程仍然依赖人工。

Method: IGD结合参数化渲染和图像资产生成，利用MLLM进行属性预测和布局，并通过扩散模型生成图像内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: IGD为图形设计提供了一种新的解决方案，支持可扩展性和可编辑性。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

TL;DR: Crucial-Diff是一个领域无关的框架，通过生成关键样本解决数据稀缺问题，提升检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成模型生成的样本重复或简单，无法针对下游模型的弱点提供关键信息。

Method: 提出Crucial-Diff框架，包含场景无关特征提取器（SAFE）和弱点感知样本挖掘器（WASM），生成多样且高质量的样本。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的像素级AP和78.12%的F1-MAX；在息肉数据集上达到81.64%的mIoU和87.69%的mDice。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff有效解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了检测和分割性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在时尚产品属性识别中的潜力，尤其是在零样本设置下的表现。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，仅以图像为输入，评估模型在18个时尚属性类别中的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.0 Flash更适合电商产品属性识别任务，但需进一步领域微调。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Motivation: 电子显微镜在光束敏感材料（如蛋白质和二维材料）中的应用受到辐射损伤的限制，需要突破传统电子显微镜的剂量限制。

Result: 在超低剂量条件下，实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态光束敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的Hölder散度和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 3DGAA为自动驾驶感知系统的安全性评估提供了一种实用的对抗攻击框架。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相位移动轮廓测量（PSP）在动态测量中因物体运动而产生误差，现有方法（如P-BSC）计算复杂度高且存在误差累积。

Method: 通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，I-BSC将二项式自补偿概念从相位序列推广到图像序列，仅需计算一次反正切函数。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单次拍摄帧率，计算复杂度降低了一个多项式阶，计算帧率提升数倍至数十倍。

Conclusion: I-BSC是一种高效且计算友好的方法，适用于高像素-深度-时间分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在跨模态信息整合上未能表现出与人类认知一致的bouba-kiki效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否能够像人类一样整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用两种方法评估CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体：基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析。

Result: 模型未表现出一致的bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据相比表现显著不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解和人类直觉对齐方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyma提出了一种基于超网络的多模态模型对齐方法，显著降低了最优单模态模型选择和连接器训练的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过训练连接器模块对齐单模态模型，但计算成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，联合训练N×M种单模态模型组合的连接器模块。

Result: Hyma将最优单模态模型对搜索成本降低10倍，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性优化框架，结合低分辨率反向传播和高分辨率零阶优化，实现内存高效且高质量的文本到图像扩散模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在边缘设备上适应文本到图像扩散模型时的内存效率和隐私保护问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著降低内存消耗的同时保持高性能，适合设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、高质量的设备端个性化，且不增加推理延迟。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Motivation: 现有PCPR模型在适应新环境或传感器类型时易发生灾难性遗忘，导致性能下降，影响实用性。

Method: 提出动态样本选择方法和基于提示学习的CL框架，结合两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在公开和自收集数据集上验证，mIR@1提升6.50%，mR@1提升7.96%，F值降低8.95%。

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoSMo, a novel multimodal Transformer for Page Stream
Segmentation (PSS) in comic books, a critical task for automated content
understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging
ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源农业环境提供了一种高效、可解释的疾病检测方案。

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模和高效训练，实现了动态场景的多任务处理，并显著提升了速度。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Conclusion: 提出的频率域调节机制为扩散模型的曝光偏差问题提供了鲁棒解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异导致的模型性能下降问题，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效扩展了CLIP的长文本处理能力，同时保持短文本性能。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多摄像头场景下的目标跟踪问题。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

Conclusion: DEARLi在标签稀缺和大分类任务中表现优异，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 研究表明，改进的点跟踪方法在超声心动图中具有显著优势，能够提升临床测量的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现更优，仅需两个训练样本即可超越随机性能，而前馈模型需至少四个。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更自适应和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are
available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.

### [120] [A Training-Free, Task-Agnostic Framework for Enhancing MLLM Performance on High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10202)

TL;DR: ECP是一种无需训练、任务无关的两阶段框架，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在高分辨率图像上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因为其训练和测试分辨率不一致，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出ECP框架，通过先提取候选区域再预测的两阶段方法，保留细粒度细节。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别实现了21.3%、5.8%、5.2%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像上的性能问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非对称表示学习（ARL）策略，通过不平衡优化提升多模态学习性能，证明模态依赖比与方差比成反比时性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因不平衡优化导致性能不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但作者认为平衡学习并非最优。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差最小化泛化误差。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于模型结构和融合方法，显著提升多模态学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解耦梯度学习（DGL）框架，解决多模态学习中模态编码器和融合模块之间的优化冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，模态编码器和融合模块之间存在优化冲突，导致性能不如单模态学习。

Method: 通过截断多模态损失对模态编码器的梯度，并用单模态损失梯度替代，同时移除单模态损失对融合模块的梯度。

Result: 实验表明DGL在多模态任务中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL成功解决了多模态学习中的优化冲突，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA方法，通过部分级可控模型实现个性化人体图像生成，无需推理时微调，且保持高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需推理时微调或大规模数据集训练，计算成本高且不适用于实时应用。

Method: 训练仅LoRA层，利用衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息丢失，引入选择性主体区域损失。

Result: 在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，实现真实且保留身份的全身体合成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA方法高效且实用，适用于个性化人体图像生成。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Motivation: Reflow在训练中通过构建噪声与图像的确定性耦合来改善生成图像质量，但存在分布差距问题，导致无法快速生成高质量图像。

Method: 提出VRFNO，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化，优化耦合并减少误差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，在单步和少步生成任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了生成图像的质量和效率。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法在性能和效率之间存在权衡，SL旨在通过维度提升解决这一问题。

Method: SL将2D图像等输入提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集上验证，SL在减少98%参数和降低推理成本的同时，保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界OOD数据有效提升了OOD检测能力，且计算开销小。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: KBA方法通过多对称性背景和优化损失显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，分类性能显著提升，最高提升1.43%。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成，有效提升了图像分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%

Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留细粒度的身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。

Method: IP-FVR采用参考图像提供身份条件，结合解耦交叉注意力、反馈学习和指数混合策略，确保帧内和帧间身份一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IP-FVR在质量和身份保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

*Hatef Otroshi Shahreza,Sébastien Marcel*

TL;DR: FaceLLM是一个专门用于面部图像理解的多模态大语言模型，通过ChatGPT生成的弱监督数据训练，提升了在面部相关任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，尤其是面部结构、表情、情感和人口统计特征的详细理解。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，使用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的图像-文本对（FairFaceGPT），训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部中心任务上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖、以人为本的多模态AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一种新颖的视频视觉封装方法，通过结合视觉概念判别器和时间焦点校准器，解决了语义模糊和时间不连贯问题，显著提升了视频多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性投影器在视频封装中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而重采样器结构虽有望解决这些问题，但尚未有有效方案。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念判别器（VCD）和时间焦点校准器（TFC），分别确保语义清晰和时间一致性。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM框架上，DisCo显著优于现有方法，并在视频理解基准测试中表现优异，同时提高了令牌效率。

Conclusion: DisCo通过创新的视觉封装方法，为视频MLLM提供了更高效和准确的输入表示。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双视觉编码器的无注释手语翻译框架，通过对比视觉-语言预训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译依赖昂贵且不完整的注释，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用双视觉编码器进行对比预训练，下游任务中融合视觉特征输入编码器-解码器模型。

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中，性能优于单流变体，达到无注释方法的最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双编码器框架在无注释手语翻译中表现优异，验证了对比预训练的有效性。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练扩散模型（IMD）的图像特征匹配框架，解决了现有基础模型在特征匹配中的对齐问题，并在多实例场景下显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像特征匹配中存在对齐问题，导致多实例匹配效果不佳。

Method: 提出IMD框架，利用生成式扩散模型捕捉实例级细节，并通过跨图像交互提示模块促进双向信息交互。

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新SOTA，在IMIM基准上提升12%。

Conclusion: IMD有效缓解了对齐问题，显著提升了多实例特征匹配的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Result: 实验表明QLIP能有效降低计算复杂度，并在多个数据集上提升生成图像质量。

Conclusion: QLIP为资源受限环境下的扩散模型量化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进平面图中墙壁分割的泛化能力，通过特征提取器注入特定领域的特征图来引导分割过程。

Method: 使用U-Net分割主干和多头部特征提取器，提取并注入墙壁纹理和宽度特征到U-Net的潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明，注入特征后性能优于普通U-Net，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙壁分割的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机图模型的文本适配器（VRGAdapter）和多分支融合方案（UMF），用于改进视觉语言模型在下游任务中的知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性文本适配器无法充分捕捉类别描述的多样性和类间关系，限制了视觉学习任务的性能。

Method: 利用顶点随机知识图（VRKG）建模类别描述的多样性和类间关系，通过概率消息传播学习上下文感知的分布表示，并结合重参数化采样实现适配器学习。同时引入UMF方案动态集成多个预训练模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter和UMF方案显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能，为适配器设计提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需处理细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉），因此需要解决细粒度ZSD问题。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了细粒度零样本目标检测问题，并通过实验验证了MSHC方法的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖专用架构或预定义增强训练，限制了泛化能力，FOCAL旨在通过数据驱动方式实现更鲁棒的视觉感知。

Method: FOCAL生成并优化候选变换，使其趋向视觉典型的“规范”视图，从而增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FOCAL提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒性实现路径。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）偏向于局部纹理特征，而TDA能有效量化复杂数据的几何信息，因此结合两者可以弥补CNN的局限性。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程管道，并将其与ResNet18模型结合，用于遥感图像分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上，模型准确率达到99.33%，比基线提升1.44%；在RESISC45数据集上，准确率比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征可以与深度学习模型结合，即使在没有显式拓扑结构的数据集上也能提升性能，扩展了TDA的适用性。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search

research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari
script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的独特物理信息。

Method: 引入CrisisLandMark数据集，开发CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像，并整合地理坐标形成GeoCLOSP。

Result: CLOSP将检索性能提升54%，GeoCLOSP在特定任务（如危机事件检索）中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理信息的结合对遥感档案的潜力挖掘至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SC-AGIQA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频率域分析，显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法高效稳定，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Result: 评估多个先进LVLM模型，揭示关键局限性和机会。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像中的视觉语言推理提供基准，支持未来LVLM开发和珊瑚保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的新架构，用于解决传统CNN在全图均匀卷积核应用中的局限性，显著提升了遥感图像融合的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因均匀卷积核应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能提升。

Method: RAPNet采用Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv)和Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF)模块，实现空间自适应卷积和特征融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合，显著提升了遥感图像融合的精度和效果。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RefSTAR的盲人脸图像恢复方法，通过参考图像的选择、转移和重建，显著提升了身份保持能力和特征转移质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在身份保持上存在问题，主要由于对细节纹理的特征引入不当。本文旨在通过有效利用高质量参考图像的特征来解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了参考选择模块（RefSel）、特征融合范式以及参考图像重建机制，并结合循环一致性损失进行优化。

Result: 在多种骨干模型上的实验表明，该方法在身份保持和特征转移质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: RefSTAR通过系统化的参考特征利用，显著提升了盲人脸图像恢复的效果。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间戳预测与地理定位的相互依赖问题，提升图像时间预测的准确性。

Method: 使用图像、时间和位置的独立编码器，在共享特征空间中对齐嵌入，并提出循环时间度量学习目标。

Result: 在时间预测和地理定位任务中表现优异，甚至优于使用真实地理信息的方法。

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间和位置预测，实现了更准确的时间戳预测，并支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Method: 结合SF2D（半监督联邦学习）、室内定位导航系统和视觉识别系统，通过可穿戴设备和机器人实现多系统协作。

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，整体准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅高效可靠，还能保护隐私，适用于老年人跌倒检测。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Result: NFM-DRA在性能上优于现有方法，但对某些未见异常仍存在性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估框架，NFM-DRA成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

Result: PRoPE在多种任务和设置中表现优异，包括新视角合成、深度估计和空间认知。

Conclusion: PRoPE能有效捕捉相机几何关系，提升多视角Transformer的性能。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Motivation: 解决小农户农业系统基础数据不足的问题，为科学政策制定提供支持。

Method: 结合高分辨率（1.5米）遥感数据和深度迁移学习，最小化参考数据需求并提升模型迁移能力。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克全国农田分布图，精度高（93%），并发现农田碎片化严重，83%的农田小于0.5公顷。

Conclusion: 农田大小是农业社会经济和环境结果的关键指标，为政策制定提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高压缩率的VQ-VAE通常需要大量计算资源，ReVQ旨在通过预训练VAE快速实现VQ-VAE训练。

Method: ReVQ结合了通道多组量化以增加码本容量，并通过后置整流器减少量化误差。

Result: ReVQ在ImageNet上仅需512个token，保持高质量重建（rFID=1.06），训练成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量之间取得了优越的平衡，显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现良好，但在需要主动交互和场景理解的具身环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用Unreal Engine和UnrealCV-Zoo构建多样化、逼真的环境，并设计多步任务。通过监督学习和强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 零样本设置下模型成功率低于20%，微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为具身推理能力的发展提供了有效基准，并展示了模型改进的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast

performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

Conclusion: Tracer通过自适应框架和合成基准解决了Re-ID任务中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras
is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the
state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID
queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal
filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized
camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications
that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query
processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing
Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the
optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to
model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high
recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model
that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically
updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy.
To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy
concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera
Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows
that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by
3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 6G等下一代无线技术对超高数据速率、低延迟和增强连接性提出了严格要求，但XL-MIMO和RIS的潜力依赖于准确的CSI，而现有模型在可扩展性和实际部署中存在局限性。

Method: 通过利用信道中的空间相关性，提出了一种基于分块的训练机制，降低输入维度并保留关键信息，实现大规模系统的可扩展训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架显著提高了估计精度并降低了计算复杂度，且不受XL-MIMO系统中天线和RIS元件数量增加的影响。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架为XL-MIMO系统中的高效信道估计提供了可行的解决方案，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding
requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced
connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and
energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control
over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However,
realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information
(CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded
channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of
existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing
number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to
real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume,
escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting
in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation
in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial
correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that
reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while
preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale
systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational
complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in
XL-MIMO systems.

Result: 多模态方法在语义分割上的mIoU比单模态方法分别提高了4%（图像）和18%（点云）。

Conclusion: 研究为基于IRU的高清语义映射提供了基准方法，并为未来基础设施辅助自动驾驶研究提供了数据集。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于蚂蚁视觉归巢行为的生物启发模型，首次在真实世界中实现了侧向蘑菇体（MB）架构，用于紧凑型自动驾驶车辆的视觉归巢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蚂蚁仅需少量学习行走和最小感官输入即可实现稳健的视觉归巢，这启发了自主导航的生物仿生解决方案。

Method: 通过侧向MB架构，利用角路径积分（PI）信号对全景视图进行分类，分为“目标在左”和“目标在右”记忆库，并在自然户外环境中验证。

Result: 通过四个递增实验验证了方法的有效性，包括模拟、真实世界归巢、随机行走归巢和精确停止行为。

Conclusion: 该系统在资源受限的设备上实现了高效且生物启发的视觉归巢解决方案。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

TL;DR: GUIDER是一个双阶段概率框架，用于机器人推断人类意图，在导航和操作阶段均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高人机协作中机器人对操作者意图的准确推断能力，避免冲突。

Method: GUIDER通过两个耦合的信念层（导航目标和操作目标）实现意图推断，结合多种技术（如Synergy Map、多视图扫描、U2Net等）。

Result: 在25次试验中，导航稳定性达93-100%，操作稳定性达94-100%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GUIDER框架在移动操作任务的双阶段中均提升了意图推断能力。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SC-ADAS是一个结合生成式AI的模块化框架，通过多轮对话和场景感知实现自适应驾驶辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADAS系统缺乏自然语言交互和场景理解能力，限制了其在动态环境中的灵活性。

Method: 集成大型语言模型、视觉到文本解释和结构化功能调用，支持基于视觉和传感器上下文的多轮对话。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中实现，展示了场景感知、对话和多轮交互的可行性，但存在延迟和令牌增长问题。

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化ADAS控制的可行性，为下一代智能驾驶辅助提供了方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Result: 展示了高质量的行为和神经影像数据。

Conclusion: 通过整合现有资源，CNeuroMod-THINGS增强了人类视觉体验建模的能力。

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets.
CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide
set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new
densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS
exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative
(THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has
developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural
and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of
large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring
hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during
controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching
and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each
completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using
approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories.
We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the
data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands
our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

TL;DR: BEAST框架通过自监督预训练视觉Transformer，解决了行为分析中标记数据稀缺的问题，提升了神经行为任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大脑需要分析其产生的行为，但现有视频分析方法依赖大量标记数据，限制了研究。

Method: 结合掩码自编码和时间对比学习，预训练实验专用的视觉Transformer。

Result: 在多种物种中，BEAST在行为特征提取、姿态估计和动作分割任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BEAST为标记数据稀缺的场景提供了高效、通用的行为分析模型。

Abstract: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it
generates -- a guiding principle in modern neuroscience research that
nevertheless presents significant technical challenges. Many studies capture
behavior with cameras, but video analysis approaches typically rely on
specialized models requiring extensive labeled data. We address this limitation
with BEAST (BEhavioral Analysis via Self-supervised pretraining of
Transformers), a novel and scalable framework that pretrains
experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses.
BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to
effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation
across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical
neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with
neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the
single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and
versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios
where labeled data remains scarce.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ESG-Net的方法，通过多阶段语义引导和多事件关系建模，显著提升了密集视听事件定位的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏中间层的跨模态语义桥接，导致模态语义差距，且未考虑事件间的相关性。

Method: ESG-Net包含早期语义交互模块（ESI）和依赖专家混合模块（MoDE），分别用于多阶段语义引导和多事件依赖提取。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，同时大幅减少了参数和计算负载。

Conclusion: ESG-Net通过分层语义理解和自适应事件依赖提取，有效聚焦事件相关信息。

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event
categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies
only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking
cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality
semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between
event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely
consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer
concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate
multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which
respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events
and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on
event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network
(ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of
dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to
explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through
multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring
hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the
extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of
experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly
reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on
https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make
deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While
prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges
the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage
pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery
localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical
explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a
plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both
technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side
comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15
participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity
and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in
identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy,
and user-centric deepfake forensics.

Motivation: 传统自回归模型在NLP中表现优异，但音频的连续性特性带来了挑战，需要新的方法。

Result: 在AudioCaps数据集上，FAD和KL指标分别提升20%和40%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法在音频生成中表现优异，接近SOTA扩散模型，同时参数效率更高。

Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become
a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable
success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm
to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We
research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete
tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution
of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant
improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40%
relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a
novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction
into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%
relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)
models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion
models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer
parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.

Result: WRCor及其投票代理在代理评估中表现优于现有方法，NAS算法在不同搜索空间中优于大多数现有算法。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效且通用的训练免费代理，能够显著提升NAS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

Conclusion: 表示引导能显著提升扩散模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

Motivation: 混杂变量会导致虚假相关性和预测偏差，现有方法（如MDN）在持续学习中难以有效处理。

Method: 引入R-MDN层，通过递归最小二乘法动态调整特征分布，适应数据和混杂变量的变化。

Result: 实验表明R-MDN在静态和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量影响，提升预测公平性。

Conclusion: R-MDN是一种有效的持续学习工具，能动态适应混杂变量变化，减少灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“warm-start model”的确定性模型，通过提供更好的起始点来加速条件生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的迭代生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配）生成高保真样本时速度较慢，通常需要数百次函数评估。本文旨在通过改进起始点来加速这一过程。

Method: 引入了一个简单的确定性模型，预测一个基于输入上下文的有信息先验（N(mu, sigma)），而不是从无信息的N(0, I)先验开始生成。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估（1次用于“warm start”，10次用于生成）即可达到与1000步DDPM基线竞争的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的条件归一化技巧与任何标准生成模型和采样器兼容，无需修改，并可与其他高效采样技术结合以进一步加速。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上部署Transformer网络具有挑战性，现有技术如低秩近似和混合精度量化可以单独使用，但结合两者可能更有效。

Method: MLoRQ采用两阶段优化过程：1) 层内优化，筛选低秩和量化的最优组合；2) 层间优化，分配位宽和秩以满足内存限制。还可通过自适应舍入技术减少压缩误差。

Result: MLoRQ在视觉Transformer任务中表现优异，性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: MLoRQ是一种高效且兼容性强的压缩方法，适用于边缘设备上的Transformer部署。

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法（如PINNs和有限差分法）需要显式数学方程，限制了其泛化性和发现潜力。

Result: 模型实现了边界到稳态的直接映射，SSIM > 0.8，且保持亚像素级边界精度。

Conclusion: 该工作标志着从AI加速物理到AI发现物理的范式转变，建立了首个通用物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何在保护用户隐私的同时学习具有高预测能力的表示。

Method: 使用对抗性表示学习方法和焦点熵（一种熵的变体）来净化敏感内容。

Result: 在多个基准测试中展示了可行性，结果表明在适度隐私泄露下具有高目标效用。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高预测能力的同时有效减少了隐私泄露。

Abstract: How can we learn a representation with high predictive power while preserving

sanitizing sensitive content from the learned representation. Specifically, we
introduce a variant of entropy - focal entropy, which mitigates the potential
information leakage of the existing entropy-based approaches. We showcase
feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at

TL;DR: CLA是一种自监督学习策略，用于在线持续学习，通过对齐当前与过去的表征来减少遗忘，加速训练收敛，并在相同计算预算下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习技术难以适应在线持续学习场景，需要在小批量数据、固定计算预算和无任务边界的情况下有效学习。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment (CLA)，通过对齐当前模型与过去表征来缓解遗忘。

Result: CLA加速了在线场景下的训练收敛，优于现有方法；作为预训练协议时，早期使用CLA比完整i.i.d.预训练表现更好。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，兼具训练效率和最终性能优势。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

Motivation: 高分辨率图像合成中扩散模型的能量不稳定和引导伪影问题影响视觉质量。

Method: 分析采样过程中的潜在能量景观，提出能量感知的CFG调度策略，动态调整引导强度。

Result: 采用线性递减CFG调度的DPM++ 2M模型表现最佳，稳定性得分（0.9998）和一致性指标（0.9873）优于固定引导方法。

Conclusion: 能量分析框架为理解和改进扩散模型行为提供了有力工具。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from
energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We
analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive
classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy
trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that
modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores
(0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance
approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling
yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化CAD设计的方法，通过生成高质量数据集并微调代码-LLMs，实现了从自然语言描述生成CAD序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD建模目前仍以耗时的手工操作为主，现有方法未能充分利用LLMs的潜力。

Method: 构建了一个包含17万多个CAD模型的数据集，基于GPT-4.1生成描述，并微调代码-LLMs以生成JSON格式的CAD序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效自动化CAD设计，显著提升设计效率。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何和拓扑指标，验证了方法的有效性，数据集和模型已公开。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉效果和性能上均优于现有技术，适用于沉浸式远程呈现和电影制作。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型深度学习算法框架，通过融合多模态医疗数据，利用非对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病的诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络和简单特征拼接方法在多模态数据融合中效果不佳，无法充分利用互补信息，且易丢失关键信息。

Method: 采用非对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，融合PET、MRI、遗传数据和临床数据等多模态信息。

Result: 在测试集上达到94.88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 非对称跨模态交叉注意力机制有效提升了多模态特征融合效果，为AD诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease
characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the
research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional
convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to
effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and
the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key
information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the
development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for
solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical
professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as
brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the
presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).
The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal
cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information
features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper
compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the
traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning
models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric
cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy
of 94.88% on the test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部CT扫描在呼吸困难患者中的应用增加，但放射科医生短缺导致报告延迟，AI可作为辅助工具提高诊断精度。

Method: 基于2016-2021年单中心回顾性研究，使用Boosted Trees模型预测AHF，并通过Shapley值解释预测。

Result: 模型在独立测试集上ROC曲线下面积为0.87，部分误分类源于初始放射学报告的错误。

Conclusion: 开发的AI模型具有强判别性能，透明预测可支持决策。

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where
acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation
remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a
radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency
physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop
an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an
accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen
University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees
model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and
pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for
training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were
segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used
to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated
twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the
independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications
found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false
negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating
from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory
performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise,
transparent predictions may support decision-making.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的新型隐私保护方法，通过选择性隐藏图像中的敏感区域（ROIs），防止模型访问隐私内容，同时保持图像其余部分的语义完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的广泛应用，用户隐私问题日益突出，尤其是模型可能无意中处理或暴露隐私视觉信息。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将隐私保护问题建模为对抗攻击问题，提出了一种选择性隐藏ROIs的攻击策略，避免破坏整个图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种先进VLMs（LLaVA、Instruct-BLIP和BLIP2-T5）上实现了高达98%的敏感区域检测率降低，同时保持全局图像语义不变。

Conclusion: 本文为多模态模型的隐私保护提供了实用工具，并推动了隐私意识的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These
models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread
adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious
concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process
or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation
of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack
strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of
Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing
sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining
image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire
image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental
results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and
BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while
maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity
scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work
contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a
practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available
at: https://github.com/hbrachemi/Vlm_defense-attack.

Result: 相比基线U-Net模型，Dice分数提高了4.1%。

Conclusion: 改进的U-Net模型能更准确地分割椎骨，适用于脊柱疾病分析。

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring
vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring
variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring
plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is
traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular,
mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra,
which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods
provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification,
segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time
consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to
accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray
images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with
dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared
to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring
reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality,
realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can
mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research,
and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a
combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR)
for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former
generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then
processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X
512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global
relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results
demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and
synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for
real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a
diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100
synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy
in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding
to random guessing).

Conclusion: 该框架通过Langevin动力学有效解决了相位检索中的感知-失真权衡问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin
dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that
explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional
approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the
perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic
sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises
three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded
Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction
sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

Result: 方法在训练效率和重建质量上均有显著提升，优于传统和现代技术。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在各种应用中高效、有效进行相位检索的潜力。

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only
measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical
computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several
well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers,
the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and
measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained
traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant
theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a
novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework
called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced
initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the
Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel
acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively
refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline.
Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation
techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared
to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential
for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for
different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper
investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying
bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity
through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested
under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and
EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared.
These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were
progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies
how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained
models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of
the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges
experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper
establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using
transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide
practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep
learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

Conclusion: 该框架为全球范围内的高分辨率温度数据生成提供了新可能。

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world
applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology
allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at
100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer
continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution
(9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for
temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The
proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the
annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth
system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from
satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16
(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective
temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.
This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for
generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,
under all weather conditions and globally.

cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical
need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of
832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed
using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to
128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50,
VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based
classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics
included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.
U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:
0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for
non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For
classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid
CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent
F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed
existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones
provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung
cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: IM-LUT是一种新颖的框架，通过混合多种插值函数实现任意尺度超分辨率，兼顾效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法仅适用于固定尺度，而任意尺度超分辨率技术计算成本高。

Method: 提出IM-Net预测插值函数混合权重，并转化为IM-LUT以提升效率。

Result: 在多个数据集上，IM-LUT在质量与效率间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: IM-LUT是资源受限应用的理想解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at
enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table
(LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and
performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale
factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing
ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with
considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these
limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework
that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to
maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a
network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on
local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of
interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are
employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight
and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT
consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency
compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising
solution for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: 多级融合架构有效整合语义信息，显著提升了脑肿瘤分割性能。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI
scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address
this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in
resource-constrained clinical environments.
