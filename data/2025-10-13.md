### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力尚未充分发挥，特别是在专业视觉任务上表现欠佳。研究旨在探索如何通过有限监督数据有效适配语言引导模型进行精确视觉理解。

Method: 采用对比研究方法，在人工文本叠加检测任务上系统评估三类模型：微调传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM、以及微调多模态LLM。关键创新在于展示LLM仅需不到1000张图像即可有效微调。

Result: 微调多模态LLM可实现高达36%的准确率提升，匹配甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN基线模型，证明了LLM方法的数据效率和适应性优势。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于LLM的方法在现实目标检测任务中的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境中应用多模态Transformer提供了实用指导，推动了视觉与语言模态的融合。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上使用U-Net架构，采用焦点损失函数，并评估水平翻转、旋转和缩放三种数据增强技术的影响

Result: U-Net配合焦点损失达到了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究为脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计建立了透明、可重复的基准

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过调整初始噪声样本来促进扩散模型更早地逃逸记忆化区域，从而减少训练数据复制，同时保持图像与文本的对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致图像与提示词对齐不佳，需要更早逃逸记忆化区域。

Method: 提出两种缓解策略：1）集体调整初始噪声，2）个体调整初始噪声，寻找能促进更早逃逸记忆化区域的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化现象，同时保持了图像与文本的良好对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定逃逸时间中起关键作用，通过优化初始噪声可以有效平衡记忆化减少和图像质量保持。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见问题，特别是在职业场景中，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram等AI图像生成工具会强化传统性别刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成可视化研究主要关注创作过程和图像质量，而忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具的广泛应用，解决和减轻有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样化代表性至关重要。

Method: 研究通过提示生成超过750张AI生成的职业图像，使用主题分析方法比较DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。

Result: 分析结果显示，DALL-E 3和Ideogram都在不同程度上强化了传统性别刻板印象，AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘代表性的风险。

Conclusion: 研究提出了针对从业者、个人和研究人员的建议，以在生成具有可见性别的图像时提高代表性。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR模型通过集成动态混合专家路由器，采用基于尺度的阈值策略来减少计算冗余，在保持图像质量的同时实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型（VAR）在生成高质量图像时存在计算冗余问题，因为需要在不断增加的分辨率上重复调用Transformer。

Method: 在VAR架构中集成动态混合专家路由器，采用基于尺度的阈值策略，根据标记复杂度和分辨率平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 实现了20%的FLOPs减少、11%的推理速度提升，同时保持了与密集基线相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 提出的动态混合专家路由方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分层贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在SemanticKITTI数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法通常依赖预测熵，但这种方法混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，容易将分布内模糊区域误判为OOD。需要一种能够准确分离不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分层贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从而提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统无监督OOD检测中不确定性混淆的问题，显著提升了检测性能，为自动驾驶等安全关键应用提供了更可靠的OOD检测方案。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并可将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在训练数据集中标注的活动与实际生活中活动范围之间的巨大差距，且不同活动类别之间存在不同程度的相似性和重叠性，需要解决开放集分类问题。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，同时收集了新的公开数据集NFI_FARED。

Result: 该方法能够以最先进准确率识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，并提供比二元"已知/未知"分类更深入的洞察。

Conclusion: 分层开放集分类方法能够有效解决HAR中的开放集问题，新数据集为未来开放集HAR研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于无监督聚类的新方法，用于自动检测癫痫患者的高频振荡（HFOs），在80-500Hz频段实现了高精度检测，并与手术结果有更强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫区域的新生物标志物，但手动检测耗时且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于临床和研究。

Method: 采用无监督聚类技术对通过S变换从时频域提取的事件进行分类，区分HFOs事件与尖峰、背景活动和伪迹。

Result: 在受控数据集上达到97.67%灵敏度、98.57%精确度和97.78% F分数；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率达到0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可导致无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2模型虽然被广泛使用但其内部表征机制仍不明确。本文通过稀疏自编码器分析发现视觉Transformer的表征超越了简单的线性稀疏结构，提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表征假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2视觉Transformer模型的内部表征机制，探索其感知的本质和表征结构。

Method: 采用线性表征假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000个单元的字典，通过分析下游任务的概念使用、表征几何统计特性来研究模型表征。

Result: 发现不同任务具有功能专门化特征；表征部分密集而非严格稀疏；表征组织超越了线性稀疏性；提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表征假说。

Conclusion: 视觉Transformer的表征结构由凸混合原型构成，符合概念空间理论，这为解释视觉Transformer表征提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过物理引导的退化自适应专家网络解决遥感图像中多种异质退化问题，在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升恢复质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化恢复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以有效处理遥感图像采集过程中的多种复杂退化因素。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，通过残差流形投影器和频率感知退化分解器从流形几何和频率角度分析退化特征，结合物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四种恢复任务中均取得最优性能，同时显著降低参数数量和计算复杂度，实现性能与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: PhyDAE通过将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，实现了对多种异质退化的精确识别和差异化处理，为遥感图像恢复提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程证明高性能医疗VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，集成了语言回归和扩散生成技术，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机中心理解和生成技术通常是孤立研究的，缺乏统一的框架来处理空间智能中的相机维度。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，训练了包含400万视觉-语言-相机三元组的大规模数据集Puffin-4M，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专门化模型，能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin为多模态空间智能研究提供了统一的相机中心框架，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准测试以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并结合群组Lasso和L1惩罚，在少量数据下实现更好的迁移学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，且在小数据下容易过拟合

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用群组Lasso和L1惩罚的组合，仅需少量额外参数即可针对特定数据进行定制

Result: 在三个少样本医学影像分类任务上评估，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础模型取得了与现有基准相竞争的结果

Conclusion: SOR是一种简单有效的框架，易于应用于各种网络组件，在迁移学习任务中具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Method: 提出BEAR基准测试包含4,469个交错图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖14个领域的6个类别任务；同时提出BEAR-Agent方法，集成预训练视觉模型来增强感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLMs的评估显示其在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性；BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 提升MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为系统评估具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物视觉机制（中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充）的对抗性防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳来选择性采样图像区域，无需重新训练下游分类器即可有效缓解对抗性噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉系统通过进化机制对对抗性扰动具有内在鲁棒性，而传统防御方法通常依赖计算密集的优化。研究假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 提出结合三种生物机制（中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的防御框架，使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周图像片段，整合成重建图像后进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提高系统对多种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的预处理方法有效缓解对抗性噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力机制的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率任务中的关键挑战，实现了SOTA的感知质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力机制的二次复杂度，造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但在超分辨率领域存在训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决的关键问题。

Method: 提出LinearSR框架：1）基于"拐点"的早期停止指导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2）SNR-based混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3）基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级指导范式TAG。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为光真实感超分辨率领域提供了稳健的线性注意力应用方法，为未来高效生成式超分辨率研究奠定了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发更高效、非侵入的自动识别技术来改善种群监测。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测，DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取高质量关键帧。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入性方法为识别kākā个体提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于改进种群监测，推动了野生动物监测新方法的发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

TL;DR: 提出Q-Router框架，使用多层级模型路由系统解决视频质量评估的泛化性、可解释性和可扩展性问题，通过VLMs动态路由专家模型实现通用VQA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在泛化能力差、可解释性有限、缺乏可扩展性等问题，无法适应多样化的视频内容和任务需求。

Method: Q-Router采用多层级路由系统，集成多种专家模型，利用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态选择和组合最合适的专家模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提升泛化能力和可解释性，在Q-Bench-Video基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: Q-Router作为下一代VQA系统的基础框架，具备时空伪影定位能力，有望作为视频生成模型的后训练奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决医学视觉问答中模态对齐、困难负样本和知识融合问题的统一框架，通过多级模态对齐、困难负样本挖掘和门控交叉注意力模块实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉问答任务需要深度理解医学图像和文本问题，现有方法在模态对齐、困难负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出三部分框架：(1)跨多级、多模态、多视图和多阶段的异构模态对齐统一方案；(2)使用软标签进行多模态对齐并加强困难负样本对区分的挖掘方法；(3)将答案词汇作为先验知识并选择相关信息门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等常用Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决模态对齐、困难负样本和知识融合等关键挑战，显著提升了医学视觉问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR通过识别视频中的低细节区域并跳过计算来加速视频超分辨率，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法处理所有像素，但许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，导致计算效率低下

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入识别低细节区域，跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理

Result: 在标准SR基准测试中，720p视频上比现有模型端到端延迟减少高达60%，且无感知质量损失

Conclusion: SkipSR提供了一种简单有效的策略，在保持视觉质量的同时大幅提升视频超分辨率的计算效率

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解解决视频大语言模型中的感知瓶颈和令牌过载问题，有效提升视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像预训练视觉语言模型在扩展到视频领域时面临感知瓶颈和令牌过载的挑战，需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入。

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构成子问题）两个核心组件。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在长视频基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架能够有效处理复杂的视频语言任务，展示了在视频理解领域的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免了传统方法中2D映射带来的噪声和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法通过将3D实例映射到2D RGB-D图像，然后使用视觉语言模型进行分类，但这种方法会引入2D遮挡噪声，并且在推理过程中计算和内存成本高昂，导致推理速度缓慢。

Method: 设计教师模型生成高质量的2D CLIP嵌入作为蒸馏学习目标，开发3D学生模型直接生成3D嵌入，提出标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识从标签一致的2D嵌入蒸馏到学生模型中。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica数据集上实验，在ScanNet200数据集上达到35.7的AP50分数，运行速度比之前方法快6.0倍到152.2倍。

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了传统方法的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能的快速开放词汇3D实例分割。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和场景，提供了代码和数据集供研究使用

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种使用双曲空间的ℓ₁-乘积度量来同时表示概念层次结构和组合结构的新方法，解决了现有视觉语言模型在同时表达这两种语义结构方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然在大规模多模态表示学习方面取得了显著成功，但在同时表达概念家族内部的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和不同概念家族之间的组合性（如"汽车里的狗"⊆狗，汽车）方面仍然存在困难。虽然最近的工作使用双曲空间来有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其在表示组合性方面的适用性尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP采用双曲因子笛卡尔积上的ℓ₁-乘积度量。在这种设计下，家族内部的层次结构出现在各个双曲因子内，而家族间的组合则通过ℓ₁-乘积度量来捕捉，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积度量设计，成功解决了同时表示概念层次结构和组合结构的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新颖的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的迁移成功率较低，主要由于模型间复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差异。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes数据集上，SegTrans相比现有最优方法平均提高8.55%的迁移攻击成功率，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans有效解决了分割模型对抗攻击的迁移性问题，在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提升了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分类模型防御方法难以直接应用于图像复原任务，因为复原是生成任务，具有连续高维输出，需要保持空间一致性和细节。微小扰动不足以阻止学生模型学习底层映射。

Method: ASVP方法对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的特征对齐，同时保持教师模型的输出质量。

Result: 在五个图像复原任务上的实验表明，ASVP能将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略。相比现有方法，ASVP提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像复原模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏攻击提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，且现有迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大数据集而效果有限，需要开发针对性的数据增强策略

Method: 对象聚焦数据增强框架：分割动物与背景，通过变换和扩散合成技术生成真实多样的场景，提升动物检测和监测性能

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺场景下也能实现实时动物健康监测，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的感知时间缩放（PTS）范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为中间可处理的子问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在视觉感知任务中的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在视觉感知任务中精度有限，推理时间缩放只能带来边际收益，这归因于当前模型的快速感知范式将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出Perception-Time Scaling（PTS）范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS显著提升了感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上将高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，并在域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token和增加模型对图像token的关注，有效提升了模型的感知能力，即使使用纯合成数据也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过估计关节被感知的可能性及其位置预测的可靠性，增强毫米波3D姿态估计器的输出，提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波姿态估计中稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型依赖统计先验而非传感器数据，过度依赖先验知识会降低手势和活动识别等下游任务的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，明确估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置的115,000多个信号帧评估中，mmJoints描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模感知偏差，有效提升了毫米波姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统检索方法在多媒体大语言模型应用中检索精度有限，现有的多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和匹配图像片段提高了精度，但仍存在对齐不足和冗余计算的问题。

Method: 1. 引入分层范式，使用多个中间粒度来处理不同图像对象以增强对齐；2. 利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性来最小化冗余检索；3. 为每个数据集自动配置参数以适应多样化场景。

Result: 实验表明，HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索精度，还将计算量减少了最高3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过高效的分层调度和冗余优化，在多向量图像检索中实现了精度和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务，开发了HandEval模型和HandPair数据集，显著提升了生成手部真实性和AIGC检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是手部）生成准确细节方面存在困难，生成的手部经常出现结构扭曲和不真实纹理，但手部区域质量评估一直被忽视。

Method: 引入HandPair数据集（包含48k高质量和低质量手部对比图像），开发HandEval模型，利用多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力并融入手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成手部质量评估提供了有效解决方案，在多个下游应用中展现出普遍有效性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Motivation: AI着色技术虽然能生成逼真的彩色图像，但存在未经授权着色和转售单色漫画、电影等版权侵权风险，目前缺乏有效的防护方法。

Method: 提出了Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过优化不可察觉的扰动，使用拉普拉斯滤波器保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御方案，为生成式媒体的版权保护开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token-by-token解码过程导致推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传播才能生成单张图像，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本的微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够减少模型前向传播次数，在保持生成图像视觉质量的同时加速生成过程。

Conclusion: SJD2框架通过去噪驱动的Jacobi迭代实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，有效解决了传统自回归模型推理效率低的问题。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和屏蔽不确定视觉标记是缓解物体幻觉的有效方法，具有简单性和实用性的优势。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在域偏移下会被放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割的域泛化中仍未被探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，整体算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出最先进的性能，证明了在噪声标签下LiDAR语义分割的鲁棒域泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

*Weijia Wang,Yuanzhi Su,Pei-Gen Ye,Yuan-Gen Wang,Xuequan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit是一个基于状态空间建模的点云法向量估计框架，通过注意力驱动的层次特征融合和块状状态空间模型来提升对局部精细几何结构的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模精细几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节的建模探索不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合(AHFF)方案自适应融合多尺度点云块特征，并设计块状状态空间模型(PSSM)将点云块建模为隐式超曲面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法，消融研究验证了所提组件的贡献。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过结合多尺度特征融合和状态空间建模，有效提升了点云法向量估计的精度和对局部几何结构的理解能力。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

TL;DR: 本文提出GL-DT框架，通过时空特征融合和全局-局部协作检测策略提升无人机多目标跟踪性能，并引入JPTrack算法解决ID切换和轨迹断裂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术提出迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标、频繁遮挡等挑战现有方法的检测精度和轨迹连续性。

Method: 采用时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: 提出Dense2MoE方法，将密集的扩散Transformer转换为混合专家结构，通过结构化稀疏化减少激活参数60%，同时保持原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer参数量大导致推理开销大，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少导致性能下降。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，提出混合块选择激活机制，设计多步蒸馏流程包括泰勒指标专家初始化、知识蒸馏和组特征损失。

Result: 将FLUX.1等大型扩散Transformer转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，性能保持原有水平，优于剪枝方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成管道，通过对象中心组合策略生成高质量的合成数据，在检测和视觉定位任务上优于大型真实图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模标注数据集成本高、存在偏见且难以扩展的问题，以及现有合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性的局限性。

Method: 基于对象中心组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量的合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在LVIS检测任务上实现+10.9 AP提升，在gRefCOCO视觉定位任务上实现+8.4 NAcc提升。在低数据设置下表现尤为突出，如LVIS实例分割+3.83 APrare，1% COCO设置下+6.59 AP。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控的数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下都能改善泛化性能，为挑战性的类内视觉定位提供有针对性的数据生成能力。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型（MSDM），通过生成逼真的图像-掩码对来解决细胞和细胞核分割中标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是针对罕见或非典型形态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，尤其是罕见或非典型形态的数据。手动标注成本高且耗时，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型（MSDM），通过细胞/细胞核形态学（水平和垂直图）、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指示元数据来条件化生成过程，生成具有所需形态特性的数据集。多种模态通过多头交叉注意力集成，实现对生成图像的细粒度控制。

Result: 定量分析表明合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像和真实图像的嵌入之间具有低Wasserstein距离。将合成样本（如柱状细胞）纳入训练集显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略能系统性地丰富数据集，直接针对模型缺陷，提高了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的更广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，通过DCT径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造，克服极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，实现独立径向和角向处理，大幅降低计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和大阶数下的数值不稳定性问题，例如Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，导致计算复杂度高达O(n^3N^2)到O(n^6N^2)，条件数缩放为O(N^4)。

Method: PSepT通过离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造实现完全核分解，实现独立的径向和角向处理，将计算复杂度降低到O(N^2 log N)，内存需求降低到O(N^2)，条件数缩放降低到O(√N)。

Result: 实验结果表明PSepT具有更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和在结构化数据集上的竞争性分类性能，同时保持精确重构。该可分离框架实现了传统方法无法实现的高阶矩分析。

Conclusion: PSepT为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新可能性，通过可分离设计实现了对传统方法的指数级改进，为高阶矩分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来，为深度模型提供更细粒度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明的系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任和问责。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或训练样本，但作者认为应该同时研究这两种视角。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，该方法将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域相关联，从而提供对深度模型内部工作机制的新见解。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能够产生细粒度的、特定于测试的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法无法暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型提供了比传统方法更深入的解释能力，能够揭示模型决策过程中的潜在问题和偏差。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，无需患者CT扫描即可在手术过程中提供导航辅助，训练仅使用模拟数据，具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支气管镜检查是呼吸医学中的基本程序，医生需要在复杂的气道结构中导航定位。现有导航方法依赖CT扫描和额外传感器，设置复杂且成本高。拓扑定位通常足以提供导航辅助，无需精确的度量定位。

Method: 开发了一种图像基础的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用模拟数据进行训练，避免了真实数据标注的高成本。该方法不需要患者CT扫描，具有良好的泛化能力。

Result: 所获得的结果超越了现有方法，特别是在真实数据测试序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为支气管镜检查提供了一种有效的导航辅助方案，无需CT扫描和复杂设置，降低了成本并提高了实用性。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>

Motivation: 实例级识别需要精细的标注，但大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了ILR在现实世界中的应用。

Method: 通过合成生成多个领域下不同条件和背景的多样化对象实例，构建大规模训练集，并在基础视觉模型上进行微调。

Result: 在七个ILR基准测试中显著提升了检索性能，涵盖多个领域。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据收集和整理提供了高效有效的替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可实现ILR，具有广泛的实际应用前景。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅能够识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别中，提供比简单标记为"未知"更有用的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代目标检测器局限于"封闭世界"假设，无法处理现实场景中的新物体。现有的开放集检测方法仅将未知物体标记为"未知"，这在安全关键应用中不够充分，因为不同的未知类别需要不同的应对策略。

Method: TARO采用独特的架构：1）基于sparsemax的头部用于建模物体性；2）层次结构指导的重标记组件提供辅助监督；3）分类模块学习层次关系。

Result: 实验表明TARO能够将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别中，显著减少未知和已知类别之间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架通过层次化分类方法有效提升了开放世界目标检测的实用性，特别是在安全关键应用场景中能够提供更有价值的决策信息。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Motivation: 现有Video Depth Anything方法依赖批处理，无法满足在线应用需求，特别是在边缘设备上的实时部署要求。

Method: 借鉴大语言模型技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码技术，实现高效的在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在准确性和VRAM使用上均优于现有在线方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功解决了在线视频深度估计的实时部署问题，特别适合边缘设备应用，并将开源代码和部署脚本。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial

study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP模型的多模态深度学习框架，用于牛只行为识别，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是评估动物健康和生产力的重要指标，视频监控结合深度学习已成为主流方法，但现有方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务上存在局限。

Method: 基于CLIP模型构建多模态框架，添加时间整合模块，采用定制数据增强和专用文本提示来解决预训练模型与真实监控视频的领域差异问题。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习达到96.1%整体准确率，喂食、饮水和站立反刍行为召回率接近100%，在少样本场景下展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺条件下的行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中3D重建面临的挑战，包括传感器量子效率低和高噪声水平，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的注意力机制，包括时空自注意力编码器探索局部和全局相关性，以及时空交叉注意力解码器集成多尺度特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS均显著优于现有方法，并贡献了大规模合成数据集和真实测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构为光子效率成像提供了有效的解决方案，通过专门的注意力设计提升了3D重建性能，推动了该领域的数据多样性发展。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理场景转换和可控故事流。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型学习识别和纠正自身错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法仅限于单提示外推，产生重复场景和动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（基于干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（基于自生成错误输出）之间的差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调技术，通过闭环回收将Diffusion Transformer的自生成错误转化为监督提示。具体包括：注入历史错误干预干净输入、单步双向积分近似预测、动态错误存储到重放记忆库。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨骼、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的错误累积问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性和创造性方面表现优异。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: 提出TEMA-LLM框架，结合LLM生成语义标签和多注意力机制，提升跨域序列推荐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电商平台需要准确捕捉用户在不同领域的特定行为和跨域行为模式，以提供个性化消费体验

Method: 使用LLM为物品标题和描述生成领域感知的描述性标签，将标签嵌入与物品标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的物品表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法凸显了LLM在推进消费电子领域智能、用户中心服务方面的潜力

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual

methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病（如冻结肩）的早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出混合运动视频诊断框架HMVDx，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑流程的可用性指标。

Result: 实验表明HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文通过建立零样本基准测试，系统比较了视觉语言模型和专用模型在图像隐私预测任务上的性能，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在准确性上仍落后于专用小模型，但在抗图像扰动方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于使用通用的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏对专用模型性能上限的系统评估，存在忽视专用模型优势的风险。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐的提示词，并与已建立的视觉专用和多模态方法进行对比分析。

Result: VLMs虽然参数多、推理速度慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专用小模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs目前在图像隐私预测任务上尚未超越专用模型的性能，但在鲁棒性方面具有优势，需要更系统的评估方法。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中可能产生幻觉的问题，提高诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供可靠的过滤策略。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（VQA-Med 2019基准和诊断放射学数据集），通过GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型回答问题15次（温度1.0），计算离散语义熵（DSE）来量化语义不一致性，过滤高熵问题（DSE > 0.3）。

Result: 过滤高熵问题后，GPT-4o的准确率从51.7%提升至76.3%（保留334/706问题），GPT-4.1的准确率从54.8%提升至63.8%（保留499/706问题），结果具有统计学显著性（p < 0.001）。

Conclusion: DSE能够通过量化语义不一致性可靠地检测黑盒VLM中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略时序信息，后者增加系统复杂度。需要统一框架同时处理时序定位和分割任务。

Method: 1) 训练时使用[FIND]令牌通过时序令牌相似性匹配识别关键时刻；2) 推理时采用时刻中心采样策略密集采样重要时刻；3) 提出双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Result: 提出的方法避免了外部时间戳编码需求，能有效保持运动细节和全局上下文，提高分割准确性和跟踪稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为RefVOS任务提供了端到端的解决方案，通过联合优化时序定位和分割，实现了更高效和准确的视频目标分割。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法在优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，特别是在多模态推理任务中。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖性重新加权轨迹优势，并专注于对感知关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在八个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得了显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略来显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态在注意力建模和视觉界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行了大规模人类受试者实验，40名参与者观看50张不同图像，在无约束条件下使用高速眼动仪记录了超过400万个注视点。分析了这些数据并训练卷积神经网络从图像输入预测注视热图。

Result: 数据显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹也遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，表明人类眼睛以最优效率方式寻找视觉信息。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Result: 实验显示，配备文本描述后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。CapGeo-Bench的评估指标与下游性能强相关。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和基准测试为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明了文本描述在几何问题解决中的有效性。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的无线电地图生成方法存在模型尺寸大、迭代去噪慢、推理延迟高等问题，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出RadioFlow框架，通过流匹配学习噪声和数据之间的连续传输轨迹，实现单步高效采样，显著加速训练和推理过程。

Result: RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，相比领先的扩散基线模型RadioDiff，参数量减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: RadioFlow为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了一条有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型，在语言引导下提取多粒度特征，改进自监督单目深度估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法因语义-空间知识提取不足而存在性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息获取方式。

Method: 采用粗到细的渐进学习框架：1）在对比语言引导下聚合CLIP的全局语义和DINO的局部空间细节特征；2）集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测。可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，所有指标均有提升，并有益于BEV感知等下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过语言引导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级别一致性正则化不足，缺乏病理结构先验知识利用，且训练中容易引入噪声伪标签

Method: 引入匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，结合细胞核形态先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签并增强高质量预测

Result: 在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有半监督方法，在某些场景下甚至超越全监督方法

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例级一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了分割精度

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过渐进式提示融合网络和选择性渐进训练机制，逐步优化模型对复合退化情况的处理能力。

Result: 该方法在特定退化条件下提供良好视觉效果，在复杂退化场景下性能显著提升8.76%，并建立了高质量多场景红外基准数据集。

Conclusion: PPFN方法能够有效处理热红外图像的单重和多重退化问题，在保持结构细节的同时提升图像对比度，为红外图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的多模态关键词预测方法，特别是动态思维链策略，能够显著提升模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，为解决多模态信息处理中的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文，缺乏对纯视觉推理能力的评估。

Method: 整合三种核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对、带注释的推理链，评估20个领先的多模态大语言模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战，现有语言空间推理策略效果不稳定且冗余，重复图像观察和主动视觉交互能提升性能。

Conclusion: 需要新的视觉推理范式，主动视觉交互模型展示了视觉推理的新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的改进框架，专门解决在无边界动态城市环境中由于点云初始化不完整导致的几何重建问题，通过体素化可见性推理、多样性感知视图选择和基于块匹配的多视图立体重建来恢复缺失结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市环境中由于观察视锥重叠不足，导致点云覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生扭曲和伪影，且现有密度化策略无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 提出VAD-GS框架：1）基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2）多样性感知视图选择选取信息丰富的支持视图；3）基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构，生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导生成新的高斯基元，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能有效工作，解决了3DGS在挑战性城市场景中的几何恢复问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的高效推理仍然是一个挑战，特别是DETR模型中的MLP层存在固有稀疏性，但现有方法未能充分利用这种特性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）SIBS - 基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2）MGS - 在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，显著减少了计算量，同时保持或提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在无需完整模型重新训练的情况下实现预训练视觉transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过两阶段框架成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题，展示了在真实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能，增强模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

### [80] [Few-shot multi-token DreamBooth with LoRa for style-consistent character generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09475)
*Ruben Pascual,Mikel Sesma-Sara,Aranzazu Jurio,Daniel Paternain,Mikel Galar*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DreamBooth的改进方法，通过多token策略和LoRA微调，实现从少量参考角色中无限生成保持艺术风格的新角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画、游戏等领域中需要生成大量新颖角色但保持统一艺术风格的问题，克服传统方法难以捕捉复杂角色细节和少样本学习的挑战。

Method: 基于DreamBooth框架，采用多token策略（通过聚类为单个角色和集体风格分配独立token），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机token和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无限角色生成的同时保持艺术风格一致性，展示了在创意产业中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 现有交互式医学图像分割评估方法不一致且临床不现实，阻碍了公平比较和真实性能评估。

Method: 建立了临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法，开发了标准化评估框架，对多种先进算法在复杂任务上进行评估。

Result: 发现五个关键发现：(1)最小化用户交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性至关重要；(2)自适应缩放机制提升鲁棒性和收敛速度；(3)验证提示行为与训练不一致时性能下降；(4)2D方法适合板状图像和粗目标，3D上下文有助于大或不规则目标；(5)非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化评估方法能够更准确地反映交互式医学图像分割算法的真实性能，为算法开发提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准测试，包含三个难度级别的工具识别、理解和创造任务，通过对32个MLLMs的评估发现现有模型在工具理解方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具使用、理解和创造是人类智能的标志，但现代MLLMs对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化。为了填补这一空白，需要专门的基准来评估MLLMs的物理工具理解能力。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个图像-文本对的视觉问答数据集，评估三个难度级别：工具识别（识别主要功能）、工具理解（理解操作原理）、工具创造（用周围物体创造新工具）。评估了32个MLLMs，包括专有、开源、专用体现和VLA骨干模型。

Result: 对32个MLLMs的全面评估显示，现有模型在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。提供了深入分析并提出了初步解决方案。

Conclusion: PhysToolBench揭示了MLLMs在物理工具理解方面的不足，为改进模型提供了基准和方向。代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文研究了三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，发现某些Galaxy S和A系列存在指纹碰撞问题，但PRO模式的原始图像可避免此问题，同时探讨了伪影在法证应用中的潜在用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影对基于PRNU的相机源验证的影响，特别是针对指纹碰撞问题以及不同设备型号和处理模式下的验证可靠性。

Method: 首先分析Galaxy S和A系列模型的共同模式导致的指纹碰撞问题，然后验证PRO模式下原始图像捕获的可靠性，最后探讨对角线伪影在法证应用中的潜在用途。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列模型存在共同的伪影模式导致指纹碰撞，类似问题也存在于部分Galaxy A模型；PRO模式的原始图像可可靠进行PRNU验证；对角线伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位肖像模式中合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影影响PRNU验证可靠性，但PRO模式原始图像可解决此问题；伪影本身在法证分析中具有应用价值，特别是在处理HDR和肖像模式图像时。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标检测，在计算约束下实现了优越的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐，增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的大量实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效解决了小目标检测中的信息退化问题，实现了更好的检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

TL;DR: FLOWING是一个基于微分向量流的形变框架，通过将形变重构为微分向量流的构建，自然确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性，在2D图像和3D形状形变中实现高质量、结构保持的形变效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLPs)作为隐式神经表示(INRs)用于形变建模时，通常需要昂贵的正则化来提取连贯准确的形变，这会导致训练不稳定并阻碍有效的特征对齐。

Method: 提出FLOWING框架，将形变重构为微分向量流的构建，将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像形变以及高斯泼溅形变等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的形变质量，并具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FLOWING通过流中心方法产生有原则且稳定的变换，实现了准确且结构保持的形变效果。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过时间调制条件LoRA适配器实现动态、上下文感知的控制，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入新模态的引导，这种静态条件策略限制了模型在多阶段去噪过程中适应其响应的能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络基于时间和用户条件动态生成LoRA适配器，为冻结的主干网络在每个扩散步骤定制权重修改，实现显式的自适应条件引导策略。

Result: 在各种数据域上的实验表明，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著增强了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层的权重功能适应来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求对齐。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于现有的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在低样本和开放集场景下。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未知类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练，为生物医学目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉研究正快速向多模态、生成式和智能体理解方向发展，训练方法从对比学习转向交叉熵/排序和蒸馏，参数高效微调成为主流。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏能有效让VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，优于从头训练大型VLA模型

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专门为实时处理无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练和推理框架解决了长视频处理中的计算成本和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临二次计算成本和性能下降的问题，滑动窗口方法要么破坏连贯性，要么因冗余重计算导致高延迟。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时通过重用注意力下沉状态、近期视觉标记短窗口和近期文本标记长窗口来维护紧凑的KV缓存。通过简单的监督微调策略，在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力，有效模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能。SFT策略还提升了通用VQA能力，在LongVideoBench上提升+4.30，在OVOBench Realtime上提升+5.96。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM实现了对无限视觉输入的实时稳定理解，解决了长视频处理的关键挑战，同时提升了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Motivation: 利用预训练音频生成模型学习到的视频/文本与音频关系知识，避免从头训练模型，提高训练效率。

Method: 基于预训练视频到音频模型进行微调，实现视频/文本查询的声音分离功能。

Result: 与现有确定性方法和生成方法相比，MMAudioSep性能更优，且微调后仍保留原始视频到音频生成能力。

Conclusion: 基础声音生成模型具有应用于声音相关下游任务的潜力，展示了迁移学习在音频处理领域的价值。

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound
separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging
knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a
pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently,
i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the
performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models,
including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and
find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the
model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This
highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted
for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种频率感知缓存方法（FreqCa），通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，以降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的推理成本高昂，现有的特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这一假设并不总是成立。本文从频域分析发现，低频和高频分量具有不同的动态特性，需要分别处理。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接重用低频特征（基于相似性），使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频特征（基于连续性）。同时提出缓存累积残差特征（CRF），将特征缓存的内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存方法通过分别处理不同频率分量的特性，有效降低了扩散变换器的推理成本，同时保持了生成和编辑的质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架，用于在动态边缘环境中实现可靠的多视角3D重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘环境中的资源动态性和不可预测性（如图像质量下降、网络不稳定、服务器负载波动）对3D重建管道的可靠性构成挑战，特别是在消防救援等关键任务应用中需要及时准确的三维场景建模

Method: 使用两个协作的Q-learning智能体：一个用于相机选择，一个用于服务器选择，两者完全在线运行，通过与边缘环境交互学习策略。构建了包含实验室设备和FABRIC基础设施的分布式测试床来模拟真实边缘场景

Result: 该框架在动态环境中有效平衡了端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够确保在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现高质量的3D重建

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: FairTTE是首个针对医学影像时间到事件预测的公平性评估框架，揭示了现有公平性方法在预后场景中的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，而忽视了预后场景，需要专门框架来评估时间到事件预测中的偏见问题

Method: 整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同影像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，开发更鲁棒、公平的预后模型

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的稀疏分解方法SCA来测量大脑与深度学习模型在视觉表征上的对齐程度，发现标准视觉DNN与腹侧流的对齐度高于背侧流和外侧流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类视觉皮层不同通路（腹侧、背侧、外侧流）与深度神经网络在功能表征上的不一致性，尽管单任务训练的DNN能很好建模整个视觉系统。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别各视觉流的主导表征成分，并开发SCA（稀疏成分对齐）方法来量化大脑与DNN的表征对齐。

Result: 发现腹侧流对脸孔、地点、身体等敏感，外侧流对社会互动、隐含运动等敏感，背侧流成分较难解释；SCA显示DNN与腹侧流的对齐度最高。

Conclusion: SCA方法能更精确地捕捉神经调谐的潜在轴，提供比传统群体几何方法更高分辨率的表征对齐测量。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态元学习框架MPC，通过自适应调整KL散度系数和Dirichlet先验强度来解决传统证据深度学习在动态数据分布下校准效果差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDL方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准效果和泛化能力不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定Dirichlet先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准效果，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确率以及基于置信度样本剔除后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过可学习的Dirichlet先验实现了对类别分布和训练动态的灵活适应，有效解决了传统EDL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

TL;DR: BBQ是一种贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，通过显式建模评分者质量来改进生成模型的人类评估方法，提供更可靠、可解释的排名结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽然更可靠但成本高且存在噪声。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: BBQ使用贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Result: 实证结果显示BBQ实现了更快的收敛、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及与基线Bradley-Terry模型相比更鲁棒、可解释的排名，即使在有噪声或众包评分者的情况下也是如此。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型的人类评估更加可靠和成本效益高。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级无监督框架，用于时间序列的结构感知压缩，通过自适应检测变化点并压缩成紧凑的token序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保持核心时序动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准表示学习方法未能充分利用时间序列中的潜在时序结构，导致在处理长序列或噪声序列时效率低下、鲁棒性差。

Method: 使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多时间分辨率的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等简单函数对每个片段进行总结。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS在保持85-90%完整模型性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本，并提高了噪声下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STaTS是一个原则性的通用解决方案，可用于高效、结构感知的时间序列建模。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Motivation: 在人机通信中建立共享目标至关重要，但模糊性可能导致输出看似正确却未能反映说话者意图。本文特别关注数据可视化领域中自然语言模糊性对代码生成的影响。

Method: 开发了模糊性类型分类体系并提出量化指标；使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题进行评估；探索三种语用模型（Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论、问题讨论框架）来指导对话策略；通过模拟用户研究评估多轮对话效果。

Conclusion: 多轮对话交流在代码生成中具有重要价值，能够通过减少模糊性来改善人机通信效果。语用对话策略有助于更准确地理解用户意图，提升代码生成质量。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI模型在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在长时程交互任务中表现不佳。受人类认知启发，需要让AI具备'替代性试错'能力，即通过心理模拟来增强对复杂环境的理解和性能。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1) ReSim阶段：通过环境交互收集真实经验，构建扩展搜索树，训练代理生成结构化推理轨迹；2) Dyna-GRPO阶段：在线强化学习方法，利用结果奖励和中间状态反馈来加强模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld三个基准测试中验证：(1) ReSim有效注入模拟能力；(2) Dyna-GRPO利用结果和交互级信号学习更好的长时程规划策略。

Conclusion: 模拟能力在使AI代理在日益复杂的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动方面发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Motivation: 传统ASR系统在专业领域术语识别上表现不佳，现有方法要么复杂低效，要么退化为简单OCR系统，需要更有效的端到端解决方案

Method: Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) - 基于Chain-of-Thought推理范式，采用<think><answer>格式强制模型先OCR识别幻灯片内容，再生成转录文本，通过强化学习优化四个奖励指标

Result: VAPO显著提升了领域特定术语的识别准确率，建立了有效的SlideASR端到端范式

Conclusion: 该方法为幻灯片语音识别提供了有效的解决方案，通过视觉锚定策略成功改善了专业术语识别问题

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with
domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as
academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which
leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve
transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be
complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs)
provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by
degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To
overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel
post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing
on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look
before Transcription" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically,
the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then
generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information
in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement
learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy,
ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we
construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic
dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves
recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end
paradigm for SlideASR.

Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐和在新颖或动态场景中的适应性受限。

Method: 提出UniWM统一模型，采用多模态自回归主干网络，集成视觉预测和规划，并使用分层记忆机制结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试中导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，并在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上展现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM代表了向统一、想象力驱动的具身导航迈出的重要一步，证明了统一模型在视觉导航中的优势。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GUI代理将轨迹压缩为文本token导致上下文长度膨胀和丢失关键视觉信息的问题，提升代理在陌生界面和长任务中的性能。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展的数据飞轮机制，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹和验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长任务和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B结合连续记忆达到与闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理的泛化能力和任务成功率，且通过低成本数据飞轮实现记忆扩展，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，使基于流的文本到图像模型具有多样性感知能力，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动来增加多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，该扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束允许在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增加变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续提高了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上被证明可以单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布，这为鲁棒保持生成质量提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

TL;DR: 提出基于图卷积网络的自适应背景网格简化框架，用于优化非结构化网格生成中的背景网格质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法创建几何贴合、计算轻量且无伪影的最优背景网格存在重大挑战

Method: 将网格简化任务重新定义为边得分回归问题，训练GCN模型预测最优边折叠候选，采用综合考虑几何保真度和尺寸场精度的自定义损失函数

Result: 简化背景网格元素减少74%-94%，尺寸场查询时间降低35%-88%

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法有效替代了昂贵的程序化评估，加速了简化过程，在复杂工程模型中表现出色

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的3D模型生成在跨模态方面取得进展，但生成具有光滑表面且最小化存储开销的模型仍是挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段框架，包含基于参数化基元的模型生成算法（识别模型组成元素的形状特征并用高质量表面的参数化基元替换）和对应的模型存储方法（保留参数化基元的参数）。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,
with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is
particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

### [108] [Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269)
*Zirun Zhou,Zhengyang Xiao,Haochuan Xu,Jing Sun,Di Wang,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对视觉-语言-动作模型的目标导向后门攻击方法GoBA，通过在训练数据中注入物理对象作为触发器，使模型在遇到物理触发器时执行预定义的目标动作，而正常输入下表现正常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型依赖未筛选的训练数据存在安全风险，现有后门攻击大多假设白盒访问且仅导致任务失败而非执行特定动作。本文旨在揭示更实际的威胁：通过物理对象触发器操纵VLA行为。

Method: 基于LIBERO基准构建BadLIBERO数据集，包含多样化的物理触发器和目标导向的后门动作。提出三级评估标准（无事可做、尝试执行、成功执行）来评估攻击效果。

Result: 实验显示，当物理触发器存在时，GoBA在97%的输入中成功实现后门目标，而干净输入上性能零下降。动作轨迹和触发器颜色显著影响攻击性能，触发器大小影响较小。

Conclusion: GoBA是一种实用且高效的后门攻击方法，揭示了VLA模型在实际部署中的安全漏洞，为未来安全研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved
embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at
https://goba-attack.github.io/.

### [109] [Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08641)
*Mathias Boulanger,Ericmoore Jossou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合时空隐式神经表示（INRs）和ADMM优化的动态X射线CT重建方法，在交错采集方案下表现出色，优于当前最先进的TIMBIR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态X射线计算机断层扫描（XCT）在交错采集方案下的重建问题，旨在提高重建效率和质量。

Method: 结合ADMM优化和INCODE条件框架，利用时空隐式神经表示进行重建，并引入加权最小二乘数据保真项进行噪声建模。

Result: 在所有测试场景中均表现优异，对中等噪声水平具有良好的鲁棒性，在更具挑战性的噪声环境下性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法具有良好的模块化特性，可扩展至实际重建框架，包括探测器非理想性建模和环形伪影校正，并为大规模数据集处理提供了并行化可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural
Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach
combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework
incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our
method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global
undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and
noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and
outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a
state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the
inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels,
and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares
data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging
regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical
reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by
explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact
correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present
a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over
batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive
parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了Evidential U-KAN方法，通过渐进式证据不确定性引导注意力机制和语义保留证据学习策略，提高医学图像分割的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有证据深度学习方法忽略了利用不确定性图中的注意力线索来改进模糊边界分割，且KL正则化会损害不确定性评估。

Method: 提出PEUA机制渐进细化注意力并使用低秩学习去噪，同时引入SAEL策略保留关键语义信息，与U-KAN结合构建Evidential U-KAN。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和可靠性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Evidential U-KAN为可信医学图像分割提供了新颖解决方案，能有效处理模糊区域并保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence
deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and
theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging
uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary
segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty
guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature
representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA
progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank
learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for
challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of
incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization,
impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently
distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a
semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a
semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term
to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the
state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for
trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The

*Yingtie Lei,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出FS-RWKV框架，利用RWKV架构实现从3T到7T MRI图像的合成，通过频率空间全向移位和结构保真增强模块，在保持解剖细节的同时提升全局组织对比度恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然能提供更高的空间分辨率和组织对比度，但由于设备成本和技术要求高，临床普及受限。计算合成方法可以从可获取的3T图像生成7T质量的图像，但现有CNN方法空间覆盖有限，Transformer模型计算开销大。

Method: 基于RWKV架构提出FS-RWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：频率空间全向移位(FSO-Shift)进行离散小波分解和全向空间移位以增强全局上下文表示；结构保真增强块(SFEB)通过频率感知特征融合自适应增强解剖结构。

Result: 在UNC和BNU数据集上的实验表明，FS-RWKV在T1w和T2w模态上均优于现有的CNN、Transformer、GAN和RWKV基线方法，实现了更好的解剖保真度和感知质量。

Conclusion: FS-RWKV为3T到7T MRI合成提供了一种高效解决方案，结合了RWKV的线性计算复杂度和强大的长程依赖捕获能力，在保持解剖细节的同时有效恢复全局组织对比度。

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue
contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in
neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners
restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs
and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality
images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this
accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial
coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead.
RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling
in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with
strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose
Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI
translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation
and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)
Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete
wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the
low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while
preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity
Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical
structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on
UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing
CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w
modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: SAM2-3dMed：将SAM2视频分割模型适配到3D医学图像分割的新框架，通过双向切片位置预测和边界检测模块解决领域差异问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2在视频分割中表现出色，但直接应用于3D医学图像存在两个关键领域差异：1）双向解剖连续性vs单向时间流；2）医学图像需要精确边界分割，而视频任务对此关注不足

Method: 提出SAM2-3dMed框架，包含两个核心模块：切片相对位置预测（SRPP）模块显式建模双向切片依赖关系，边界检测（BD）模块增强关键器官边界的分割精度

Result: 在医学分割十项全能（MSD）数据集的肺、脾和胰腺三个数据集上验证，SAM2-3dMed在分割重叠率和边界精度方面显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了3D医学图像分割性能，还为将视频基础模型适配到空间体数据提供了一般性范式

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
segmentation across the lifespan.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and

architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting
the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and
