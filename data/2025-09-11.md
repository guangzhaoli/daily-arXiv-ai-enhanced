TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于3D和4D世界建模的首个全面综述，提出了标准化的定义和分类法，系统总结了视频、占据网格和LiDAR三种主要方法，并整理了相关数据集和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要集中在2D图像和视频生成，忽略了快速发展的3D/4D表示方法（如RGB-D、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准化的定义和分类体系，导致文献中的研究碎片化且不一致。

Method: 建立了精确的定义体系，提出了结构化分类法（VideoGen视频生成、OccGen占据网格生成、LiDARGen激光雷达生成），系统总结了专门针对3D/4D环境的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，为领域建立了标准化的参考框架，整理了现有文献的系统性总结。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了3D/4D世界建模领域的空白，为推进该领域提供了连贯和基础性的参考，识别了开放挑战并指明了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和分层注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模态特征集成和噪声环境适应性方面存在局限。

Method: XFloodNet包含三个核心组件：分层跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块、以及级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐、多尺度特征提取和分层特征协调。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个基准数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过先进的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，提供了鲁棒且抗噪声的洪水检测解决方案，为解决城市洪水这一关键挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集并聚合输出概率，在不增加上下文窗口的情况下提升VideoLLMs的时序推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs在处理长视频时面临计算成本高和性能下降的问题，需要一种在不增加上下文长度的情况下提升感知带宽的方法

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同不相交子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验表明，VPS在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中持续显著提升性能，比其他并行替代方案扩展性更好

Conclusion: VPS提供了一种内存高效且鲁棒的框架，能够增强VideoLLMs的时序推理能力，且与其他解码策略互补

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，通过大语言模型和图片说明生成器提取文本和视觉信息，使用专门的transformer模块进行融合，在MultiClimate数据集上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法主要关注文本数据，而真实社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，需要充分利用多模态信息的高级方法

Method: 采用分层融合方法：首先用大语言模型从源文本中提取立场相关摘要，用领域知识图片说明生成器在目标话题上解释视觉内容，然后通过专门的transformer模块共同建模文本、图片和回复文本之间的交互作用

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%、精度76.3%、召回率76.2%和F1分数76.2%，表现超过现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该多模态立场检测框架能够有效融合文本和视觉信息，提供更准确的立场分析，为社交媒体多模态内容分析开启了新方向

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含8万多个样本，并证明专门训练的小型模型在高程预测任务上超过了大型基础模型的零样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星高程模型数据中存在的人工偏差和缺失数据问题，为机器学习应用提供一个高质量、充分覆盖火星表面的数据集

Method: 使用自动化管道处理火星拍摄的高分辨率正式图像和DEM数据对，发展工具减少数据缺失和偏差影响，并将数据分割为训练和验证集以避免数据泄漏

Result: 创建了包含80,898个样本的MCTED数据集，每个样本包含光学图像、DEM图像和两个掩码图像，训练的小型U-Net模型在高程预测任务上超过了DepthAnythingV2基础模型的零样本性能

Conclusion: 专门设计的基于领域特定数据的小型模型在特定任务上可能比大型基础模型更有效，为火星远感数据处理提供了价值较高的数据集资源

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应概率匹配损失（APML），一种完全可微分的一对一匹配近似方法，通过Sinkhorn迭代实现，解决了传统点云损失函数的多对一对应问题，在保持接近二次时间复杂度的情况下提供更好的空间分布和收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测任务的损失函数（如Chamfer Distance）存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作。EMD虽然能强制一对一对应但计算复杂度太高。

Method: 基于成对距离构建温度缩放相似度矩阵，利用Sinkhorn迭代实现概率匹配，通过分析计算温度值保证最小分配概率，无需手动调参，实现完全可微分操作。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失实现了更快收敛、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或更好的量化性能，无需额外超参数搜索。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种计算高效、完全可微分的一对一匹配近似方案，有效解决了传统点云损失函数的局限性，在各种点云预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet，一种基于RPCA的轻量级红外小目标检测框架，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块实现参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题

Method: 构建分层瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整和特征精炼，嵌入噪声抑制模块，采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了相比RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出超稀疏采样（USS）策略和BSTFormer网络，通过每个空间位置仅一个子帧采样来显著降低视频压缩成像功耗，相比随机采样策略具有更高动态范围和固定曝光时间优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字相机功耗过高，无法支持千兆像素级高速成像需求。现有压缩感知方法虽然能降低功耗，但仍有优化空间

Method: 提出USS采样策略（每个空间位置仅一个子帧为1），设计BSTFormer网络结合局部块注意力、全局稀疏注意力和时间注意力来处理采样数据不匹配问题

Result: 在仿真和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于所有现有最先进算法，USS策略相比随机采样具有更高动态范围

Conclusion: USS策略是实现片上完整视频压缩成像系统的理想选择，因其固定曝光时间特性而具有实际应用优势

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测致命犯罪事件（如枪击、刺伤），因为这类事件罕见且存在数据收集的伦理问题

Method: 使用GTA5游戏创建致命犯罪视频数据集，包含多视角、多条件的CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，弥合合成数据与真实数据特征差异

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能够持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测的准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命犯罪检测的数据稀缺问题提供了可行的合成数据解决方案，通过域适应技术成功将游戏生成数据应用于真实场景

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像适配到ViT架构，在TB和肺炎检测任务上实现了新的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT架构通常在自然图像上预训练且需要三通道输入，而CXR扫描图像本质上是灰度单通道图像，存在输入格式不匹配的问题

Method: 采用通道复制策略，将单通道CXR图像复制成三通道格式，以适应ViT架构的输入要求，避免信息损失

Result: 在三个基准数据集上均取得优异表现：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%，AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%，AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%，AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学影像任务中充分发挥其表征能力，为TB和肺炎检测建立了新的SOTA，具有实际临床部署潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Method: 设计了可学习双重积分(LDI)网络估计参考帧与清晰潜在图像的映射关系，引入基于学习的除法重建模块优化结果，提出自适应无参数融合策略，并构建自监督学习框架。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视频去模糊和插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EVDI++框架通过有效利用事件数据，成功解决了视频去模糊和插值问题，在真实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱建模方法有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)在处理需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题时，会依赖训练时的固有偏见而忽视视觉证据，导致性能下降。通过多维度分析框架，发现即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小变化也会显著影响VLM的回答方式和整体表现。

Motivation: 现有研究表明VLMs在处理涉及图像视觉属性的问题时存在固有偏见，特别是在需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题上表现不佳。本研究旨在系统性地探究导致这种性能差异的输入数据特征。

Method: 开发多维度检查框架，使用开源VLMs分析注意力值如何随不同输入参数（如图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）波动，系统研究图像和提示词特征对模型行为的影响。

Result: 研究发现即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小修改也会导致VLMs回答方式的巨大变化，从而显著影响其整体性能。模型在处理需要精确视觉分析的特定问题时容易忽视实际视觉证据。

Conclusion: VLMs对输入参数的微小变化高度敏感，这揭示了模型在处理需要精确视觉分析的特定任务时存在的局限性，为理解VLMs行为变化特征和性能优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL有效缓解了过拟合问题，在广义零样本语义分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督目标检测框架，通过热图引导的候选框选择算法、改进的基础检测网络和负确定性监督损失，解决了现有方法在伪标注生成、语义鸿沟和收敛速度方面的三大局限性，在VOC数据集上取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督目标检测方法存在三个关键问题：1) 生成的伪标注要么只关注判别性部分，要么无法区分相邻同类实例；2) WSDDN基础架构缺乏背景类表示且分支间存在语义鸿沟；3) 忽略候选框导致收敛缓慢。

Method: 1) 热图引导候选框选择器(HGPS)：使用双阈值热图预选候选框；2) 弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)：为每个候选框增加背景类表示，用热图进行预监督；3) 负确定性监督损失：对忽略候选框施加监督以加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上分别达到58.5%/81.8%和55.6%/80.5%的mAP/mCorLoc分数，优于现有的弱监督目标检测方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了弱监督目标检测中的关键挑战，通过热图引导选择、网络架构改进和损失函数优化，显著提升了检测性能，为弱监督学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert

provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY

improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Motivation: 实时图像分类在资源受限平台上需要平衡精度与延迟/功耗。传统早期退出训练存在协方差偏移问题，即下游分支训练时使用全数据集，而推理时只处理困难样本，限制了实际效率-精度权衡

Method: BTS-EE顺序训练方法：逐分支训练和校准，确保在选择性推理条件下的鲁棒性；提出基于1D卷积的轻量分支架构和Class Precision Margin校准方法，支持逐类阈值调优

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用的效率提升

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: VRAE方法在保持参数效率的同时，显著提升了交通监控图像增强的性能，为车牌识别系统提供了有效的预处理解决方案

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的新型视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间操作显著降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在三个视频数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在自动驾驶和医疗等安全关键领域应用日益广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏可操作因果洞察等问题，需要更好的解释方法来增强AI系统的可信度。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，相比传统方法显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k和Something-Something V2三个视频数据集上，LD-ViCE优于现有最先进方法，R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成的解释具有语义意义和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是向安全关键领域可信AI部署迈出的重要一步，为视频AI模型行为提供了有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: HyperTTA是一个统一框架，通过构建多退化高光谱数据集、设计光谱-空间Transformer分类器，以及轻量级测试时适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类在多种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提升模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含九种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计带有多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间Transformer分类器；3) 提出置信感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)，仅更新LayerNorm层的仿射参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA通过综合的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级测试时适应策略，成功解决了高光谱图像分类在退化条件下的鲁棒性问题，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了球形布朗桥扩散模型(SBDM)，用于预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹，在ADNI和OASIS数据集上显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微皮层变化、了解神经退行性过程和制定早期干预策略至关重要，但由于皮层复杂的非欧几何特性和多模态数据整合需求，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入双向条件布朗桥扩散过程，提出新的去噪模型条件球形U-Net(CoS-UNet)，结合球形卷积和密集交叉注意力机制来整合皮层表面和表格条件数据。

Result: 相比之前方法，SBDM在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上实现了显著降低的预测误差，能够生成个体事实和反事实皮层厚度轨迹。

Conclusion: SBDM为探索皮层发育假设情景提供了一个新颖框架，在皮层厚度预测方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，对SSM模块本身关注不足，需要探索SSM在视觉任务中的潜力

Method: 在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，分析累积误差，改进MambaIR模型的SSM计算过程

Result: 在五个基准数据集上FSSM提升了MambaIR性能，超越了当前轻量级SR方法，达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM计算过程有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了SSM模块优化的重要性

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比自监督学习在多视图假设下通常能学习判别性特征，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足。受Yann LeCun启发，探索多视图框架在不平衡数据集上的应用

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多视图目标函数，通过区分类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类别代表性特征，引入过滤极端特征的损失函数

Result: 在多种自监督框架上验证有效，Cifar10-LT提升2%，Cifar100-LT提升5%，Imagenet-LT提升3%，达到新的SOTA准确率

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能有效改善不平衡数据集上的自监督学习性能，通过互信息理论框架成功提取尾部类别特征

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图像分析需要多个独立工具的问题，通过单一自然语言指令实现定位、分割、编辑和描述的多步骤处理，提高工作效率和用户体验。

Method: 构建统一管道，结合开放词汇检测、提示分割、文本条件修复和视觉语言描述技术，提供交互式UI和可编写脚本的CLI接口，集成阈值调整、掩码检查和资源感知默认值等稳定性措施。

Result: 在单词语提示场景中，检测和分割的可用掩码成功率超过90%，准确率高于85%；高端GPU上修复步骤占运行时60-75%，需要精细调优。

Conclusion: 提供了一个透明可靠的模式，将现代视觉和多模态模型组装到单一提示后，通过明确的防护措施和操作实践提高了对象替换、场景增强和移除的可靠性。

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了水下目标检测(UOD)的挑战，将其分为五大类，分析了从传统方法到现代技术的演进，并探讨了大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在UOD中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋应用至关重要，但面临图像质量退化、目标相关问题、数据挑战、计算约束和方法局限等多重挑战，现有方法难以充分应对复杂水下环境。

Method: 系统分类UOD挑战为五大领域，分析传统图像处理和检测技术的演进，探索LVLMs的多模态能力，并通过案例研究(如使用DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2 LVLM)验证应用潜力。

Result: 识别出三个关键见解：(1)当前UOD方法对动态水下环境中的图像退化和小目标检测不足；(2)LVLMs合成数据生成有潜力但需改进真实性和适用性；(3)LVLMs对UOD有重要前景但实时应用仍需优化技术研究。

Conclusion: LVLMs为水下目标检测带来新的可能性，特别是在数据增强和多模态处理方面，但需要进一步研究解决实时性、优化技术和数据真实性等问题，以充分发挥其在水下环境中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Motivation: 现有视频嵌入对时间变化不敏感，无法区分如开门vs关门等时间上相反的动作对，需要开发能感知视觉时间变化的紧凑视频表示

Method: 基于感知直线化启发的自编码器方法，在冻结图像特征序列上注入时间敏感性，构建具有归纳偏置的潜在空间

Result: 在Something-Something、EPIC-Kitchens和Charade三个数据集上表现出色，超越大型视频模型，并能提升现有模型在标准基准上的分类性能

Conclusion: 提出的自监督适应方法能有效构建紧凑且时间敏感的视频表示，在手性动作识别任务中优于大型模型，并能增强现有模型的性能

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频生成方法难以有效协调文本、图像和音频等异构模态输入，主要面临两个挑战：配对三元组训练数据稀缺，以及主体保持和音视频同步子任务难以与多模态输入协同工作。

Method: 构建高质量配对数据集；采用两阶段渐进式多模态训练范式：第一阶段使用最小侵入式图像注入策略保持主体，第二阶段加入音视频同步任务，提出预测引导策略关联音频与面部区域；推理时使用时间自适应分类器自由引导策略。

Conclusion: HuMo成功解决了多模态输入协调的挑战，通过创新的训练策略和推理方法，实现了灵活细粒度的多模态控制，为人类中心视频生成提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多选题），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上方法评估基础物体、粗到细的主体特征以及主体-动作对

Result: LVMs在识别基础物体和特征方面表现良好，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主体的动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的视频幻觉评估方法，揭示了LVMs在不同复杂度任务中的幻觉模式

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单视图分类或回归模型在植物表型分析中往往无法捕获准确估计目标表型特征所需的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获准备预测的准确性。

Method: 使用ViewSparsifier方法，通过随机选择24个视图（选择向量）来学习视图不变嵌入，并实验了跨5个高度级别的随机视图选择（120个视图，选择矩阵）。

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在GroMo挑战赛的两个任务中都获得了优胜。

Conclusion: 多视图学习和视图不变嵌入能有效提升植物表型分析的准确性，随机视图选择是有效的技术，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Conclusion: 所提出的两种机制的协同作用显著提高了模型的泛化能力，有效解决了医学图像分割中的多模态融合挑战

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Motivation: 格陵兰冰下床地形图对海平面预测至关重要，但雷达观测数据稀疏且分布不均，需要开发新方法来处理这种数据稀缺和不确定性问题。

Method: 构建基于地表观测数据（高程、速度、质量平衡）的空间图，增加梯度特征和多项式趋势来捕捉局部变异和整体结构，采用混合损失函数结合置信度加权的雷达监督和动态平衡正则化。

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻医学专业人员在复杂3D分割任务中的手动工作量，特别是在放射治疗规划和退行性疾病诊断中，这些任务目前无法完全自动化

Method: 引入隐式形状先验来从稀疏切片手动标注中分割体积（扩展到多器官情况），并提供自动选择最具信息量切片的简单框架以指导并最小化后续交互

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著减少医学3D分割中的人工标注负担，在放射治疗和疾病诊断等实际应用中表现出良好的效果

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Motivation: 当前检测器主要针对传统篡改类型（拼接、复制移动、物体移除），缺乏对新兴扩散伪造方法的检测能力，且现有方法计算复杂度高，难以处理高分辨率图像。

Method: 提出EfficientIML模型，采用轻量级三阶段EfficientRWKV主干网络，结合混合状态空间和注意力机制捕获全局上下文和局部细节，并使用多尺度监督策略确保分层预测一致性。

Result: 在自建数据集和标准基准测试中，该方法在定位性能、FLOPs和推理速度方面均优于基于ViT和其他SOTA轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合实时取证应用，为解决高分辨率扩散伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决成对多模态眼科图像获取成本高、OCT数据稀缺、模态不平衡等问题，同时充分利用不同模态提供的病变位置信息

Method: 通过对比学习在大量不成对OCT和底射图像上学习题值位点矩阵，该矩阵在OCT特征空间中捐捕疾病定位模式，在仅使用底射图像分类时用于辅助学习

Result: 在9个多样化数据集上过28个关键疾病类别的实验中，该框架表现超过现有标准方法

Conclusion: 方法成功解决了多模态数据不成对问题，通过OCT空间前验知识有效提升了单模态底射图像的疾病识别能力

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临挑战，需要大量重新训练或昂贵的配对数据。为了解决这些限制，作者提出了LADB框架。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，使用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练。

Result: 实验结果显示在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现优异，并能扩展到多源转换和多目标转换任务。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界领域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的情况。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过解耦手势形态和运动轨迹的双参考系方法，有效解决了孤立手语识别中的几何模糊性问题，在多个数据集上实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架成功实现了无需真实标注的光流估计，分形网络架构和变分正则化的结合有效提升了光流估计的准确性和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)

applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity

reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Method: 开发CQ模块预测目标密度图并将其嵌入到解码器中，使用密度引导的查询来改进检测，提出了CQ2D和CQ3D架构

Result: 在STCrowd数据集上相比基础模型有显著性能提升，优于大多数最先进方法；在CrowdHuman数据集上也能进一步提升性能

Conclusion: CQ方法是首个有效桥接2D和3D拥挤环境检测的方法，具有通用性且不需要额外数据

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏先验地图、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法必须依赖合成先验，造成不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级别的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench基准测试中，MMB在成对偏好判断准确性、与人类标注对齐以及校准性方面优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 多模态特定策略对于评估模型校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模TTI评估提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

TL;DR: 基于移动端皮肤图像的深度学习框架，用于砷中毒的自动化诊断，Transformer模型在11000多张图像上达到86%准确率，具有临床可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决南亚和东南亚地区砷中毒早期皮肤表现诊断不足的问题，特别是在农村地区缺乏皮肤科医生的情况下，需要自动化的图像诊断方案来支持早期检测和及时干预。

Method: 构建包含20个类别、11000多张砷中毒及其他皮肤病图像的数据库，比较CNN和Transformer等多种深度学习架构，集成LIME和Grad-CAM进行模型可解释性分析，并开发基于web的诊断工具。

Result: Transformer模型显著优于CNN，Swin Transformer达到86%的准确率；可视化技术确认模型关注病灶相关区域；在外部验证样本上表现良好，具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了深度学习在移动端图像非侵入性、可访问性和可解释性砷中毒诊断方面的潜力，可作为农村和资源有限社区的实用诊断辅助工具，支持早期检测和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在星跟踪应用中缺乏准确地面实况数据的问题，利用地球规律自转作为参考基准来验证系统精度。

Method: 将静态事件相机通过地面望远镜指向夜空，利用地球自转作为唯一运动源，处理事件流生成方向估计，并与IERS测量的地球方向进行比较。

Result: 系统达到18.47角秒的均方根误差和78.84角秒的绝对误差，同时具备稀疏数据流、高动态范围、低能耗和高更新率等优势。

Conclusion: 事件相机在星跟踪应用中表现出实用价值，特别适合低成本、低延迟的航天器姿态确定任务。

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只生成单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像强缩放等挑战性场景中容易产生错误匹配。

Method: 采用波束搜索策略在每层尺度传播多个假设，并将多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建BEAMER架构来学习和传播多假设。

Result: BEAMER能够显著提升匹配鲁棒性，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像强缩放的情况下优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多假设方法在密集图像匹配中具有重要价值，BEAMER架构通过跨尺度保持和传播多假设有效解决了传统单一假设方法的局限性。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决视觉生成中奖励模型扩展的挑战，支持26B参数规模并有效防止奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型存在架构限制和模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与视觉语言模型不匹配，且RLHF优化过程中存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了视觉生成奖励模型的有效扩展。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像优于参考图像，实现奖励目标与VLM架构的内在对齐，支持模型规模和上下文规模的双重扩展。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，有效抵抗黑客攻击并产生多样化高质量输出。

Conclusion: RewardDance解决了奖励模型扩展的根本挑战，通过生成式奖励范式实现了可扩展的奖励建模，有效缓解了模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成任务提供了强大的奖励信号。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Conclusion: 方法能够同时完成高质量的3D动态重建和外观估计，为单目视频处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the
day and night. The policy is validated across 20 flights, covering 589 meters
without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications

generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and

Result: 建立了该领域的性能基准，为自动化中风康复评估提供了首个专门数据集

Conclusion: StrokeVision-Bench数据集填补了临床结构化评估任务数据的空白，为开发客观、量化的中风康复评估方法提供了重要资源

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of
upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying
heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity
limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical
image diagnosis.

TL;DR: 开发了一个深度学习工具来自动测量脑萎缩评分，在老年患者CT脑扫描中验证了其与人工评分的准确性，平均绝对误差为3.2，与年龄和认知评分显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前脑萎缩量化需要耗时的视觉评分量表，需要开发自动化脑图像分析工具来提高效率和标准化测量。

Method: 使用深度学习工具测量全球脑萎缩(GCA)评分，在864个老年患者CT脑扫描上进行训练、优化和测试，与两名训练有素的评分者进行比较评估。

Result: DL工具与评分者1的GCA评分平均绝对误差为3.2，半数扫描的预测误差在-2到2之间。DL工具与评分者的一致性(kappa=0.45)高于评分者之间的一致性(kappa=0.28)。DL工具评分与年龄和认知评分显著相关(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: 该深度学习工具能够在真实世界的老年患者扫描中准确测量脑萎缩评分，无需用户输入，为健康数据研究提供标准化定量测量，并为开发临床批准的即时护理工具提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

Conclusion: PGRF框架通过物理建模和生成式方法的结合，有效解决了低光图像增强中的噪声模拟问题，为实际应用提供了更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and
experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid
model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced
and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model,
complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of
0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85,
suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all

TL;DR: RoentMod是一个反事实图像编辑框架，用于生成具有指定病理特征的真实胸片图像，用于检测和纠正医学AI中的捷径学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸片解读中容易依赖虚假相关性进行决策（捷径学习），需要一种方法来检测和纠正这种漏洞。

Method: 结合开源医学图像生成器RoentGen和图像到图像修改模型，无需重新训练即可生成具有指定病理特征的反事实胸片图像。

Result: RoentMod生成的图像93%看起来真实，89-99%正确包含指定发现。使用该框架训练可提高模型区分能力（AUC提升3-19%）。

Conclusion: RoentMod是检测和纠正医学AI中捷径学习的通用工具，通过反事实干预增强了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

Motivation: 深度伪造生成技术的快速发展对检测系统提出了严峻挑战，传统非持续学习方法需要频繁且昂贵的重新训练，无法适应技术的快速演进。

Method: 提出了一个持续学习框架，模拟真实世界深度伪造技术的时间演化过程（跨越7年），基于轻量级视觉骨干网络实现实时检测性能，并引入了两个新评估指标。

Result: 实验表明框架实现了高效适应（比完全重新训练快155倍）和稳健的历史知识保留，但对未来生成器的泛化能力接近随机水平（FWT-AUC ≈ 0.5）。

Conclusion: 研究提出了非通用深度伪造分布假说，指出当前方法对未来生成器的泛化存在根本性限制，需要新的解决方案来应对深度伪造技术的持续演进。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.
