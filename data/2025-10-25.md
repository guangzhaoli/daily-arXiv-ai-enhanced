### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合频域分析和深度学习的方法，用于检测StyleGAN生成的图像与真实图像的区别，通过二维离散傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络实现了92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成了严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实图像和合成图像。

Method: 使用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，然后训练ResNet50神经网络在频域中检测周期性伪影，从而区分真实图像和StyleGAN生成的图像。

Result: 频域模型达到了92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或"指纹"，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法具有增强数字取证和工业AI系统可信度的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合在3D形状特征表示学习中的效果，证明了该方法在多视角3D分析任务中优于传统CNN方法，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临的挑战，包括需要大量标注数据以及CNN可能忽略关键形状关系的问题。

Method: 将Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标（包括监督对比学习和自监督对比学习）相结合，用于多视角3D形状分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比学习方法达到了约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT通过捕捉全局形状语义，结合对比学习优化局部判别特征，有效克服了传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖和CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建。该方法利用多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型，在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单传感器跟踪方法在遮挡和视角变化下性能受限，需要开发能够充分利用多模态传感器特征的鲁棒跟踪框架，以改进基于transformer的跟踪器性能。

Method: 采用两阶段transformer细化跟踪流程：1）使用基于移动窗口的时间平滑器对边界框序列进行细化；2）融合跟踪器集成边界框与多模态BEV特征，利用几何和语义线索进行身份分配和传播。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出强大性能，减少了身份切换，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: FutrTrack证明了基于查询的transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著，为改进基于transformer的跟踪器提供了高效框架，即使在有限数据和无预训练情况下也能与其他神经网络方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑（OLS）通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的模型过度自信问题，相比传统方法在准确性和特征表示学习方面均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 提出在线标签平滑（OLS）方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签，在RadImageNet数据集上使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19架构进行评估。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于标准训练方法，同时产生更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入，表明表示学习能力得到改善。

Conclusion: OLS不仅提升了预测性能，还增强了模型校准能力，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对鱼眼图像中目标检测的预处理和后处理框架，通过集成多个先进检测模型提升在严重畸变区域的检测一致性，在AI City Challenge Track 4中取得第8名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机虽然能高效捕获大视野，但其强径向畸变和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化时。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理流程，在鱼眼交通图像上训练多个先进检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出以提高检测精度。

Result: 在2025年AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62个团队中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的检测问题，证明了框架在处理严重畸变条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知滤波方法，用于解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的相机视角下会出现明显的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测的不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行滤波，直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉质量、真实感和一致性方面显著优于现有的NeRF方法（如BayesRays），并能实时集成到现有3DGS渲染流程中。

Conclusion: 提出的滤波方法能够有效提升3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时的视觉保真度，无需大量后训练或微调。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BrainPuzzle混合框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，通过两阶段方法解决超声脑成像中声速重建的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受限于颅骨引起的信号衰减和空间覆盖不全，纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下会产生定量偏差

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据，第二阶段使用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合碎片化数据

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性

Conclusion: 该方法展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，特别是在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了生成式图像模型在文化和时代表示方面的偏见，发现模型默认偏向全球北方和现代描绘，图像到图像编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且当前系统对文化敏感编辑不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立标准化评估框架来诊断生成式图像模型的文化偏见。

Method: 使用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别的模式，结合时代感知提示，采用标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的人类判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1)国家无关提示下模型默认全球北方现代描绘；(2)迭代图像编辑侵蚀文化保真度；(3)图像模型仅应用表面线索而非情境感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统对文化敏感编辑不可靠，研究提供了可复现的文化中心基准来诊断和追踪生成式图像模型的文化偏见。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR是一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件流重建强度图像，相比神经网络方法更简单且能在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的事件图像重建方法通常需要GPU且复杂度高，作者希望开发一种更简单、异步的CPU可运行方法。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器积分事件强度变化，通过新颖的算法检测陈旧像素，并对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波以减少重建噪声。

Result: FIBAR在现代笔记本电脑CPU上达到约42-140百万事件/秒的处理速度，重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如检测基准标记。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步重建方案，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但对于某些应用场景已经足够实用。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [10] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过自适应学习酉变换和利用双边结构，改进了图像聚类性能，并增强了对噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换且对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕捉全局相关性和处理复杂噪声的方法。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用潜在张量数据的双边结构，整合ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化项，并基于ADMM开发高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示在图像聚类中的性能和对噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化、合并和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构和隐私问题，提供用户友好的隐私保护手术视频管理方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学可以推动手术培训、研究和质量改进，但广泛使用受到异构录制格式和视频共享隐私问题的限制。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期方法，基于用户反馈迭代开发。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构；测试阶段结合可用性启发法和技术接受模型评估可用性和采用度。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性（4.68/5和4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理管道，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证来确立为可部署的替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)来融合自注意力机制的优势到卷积操作中，解决了自注意力的二次复杂度问题，同时保持了卷积的线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在视觉任务中表现出强大的表达能力，但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积虽然具有线性复杂度，但性能始终存在差距。作者旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计新型卷积算子。

Method: 通过分析发现自注意力的两个关键优势：自适应路由和侧向抑制。基于此提出ATConv，将3×3卷积核重新设计为具有自适应路由和侧向抑制功能的算子。

Result: ATConv在基础视觉任务中超越各种自注意力机制，基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%准确率。在扩散模型中替换自注意力后，FID降低0.15且采样更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积操作，实现了高性能与高效率的平衡，为视觉主干网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

TL;DR: StableSketcher是一个基于扩散模型的框架，专门用于生成像素级手绘草图，通过优化VAE解码器和引入基于视觉问答的奖励函数来提高文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成抽象表达（如手绘草图）方面仍存在挑战，现有数据集主要依赖图像-标签对，缺乏实例级草图与描述性文本的配对数据。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数用于强化学习，改善文本-图像对齐；3. 构建SketchDUO数据集，包含实例级草图与标题、问答对的配对数据。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了手绘草图生成的挑战，提供了首个包含丰富文本标注的草图数据集，为抽象表达生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用描述性字幕作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督来源，通过生成合成字幕来增强模型训练，提高物种分类和文本图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像和字幕可以视为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，每种都捕捉了特定的生物特征。在训练中加入字幕可以促进与这种共享潜在结构的对齐，强调潜在诊断特征，同时抑制虚假相关性。主要挑战在于如何大规模获取忠实、实例特定的字幕。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成字幕，通过维基百科衍生的视觉信息和分类单元定制的格式示例来指导生成，减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性字幕。基于这些字幕训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本图像检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性字幕超越了传统标签的价值，在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要作用。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Motivation: 现有后处理方法未能充分利用模型logits空间中的丰富信息，特别是在最大logit与其余logits关系方面存在利用不足

Method: 提出LogitGap后处理OOD检测方法，通过显式利用最大logit与剩余logits的关系来增强可分性，并引入无训练策略自动识别最有信息量的logits子集

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中均能实现最先进性能

Conclusion: LogitGap方法有效利用了logits空间中的关键信息，为OOD检测提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和可用性。需要更高质量、更易用的3D部件理解数据集来推动计算机视觉、图形学和机器人学的发展。

Method: 构建了包含23,000+高质量纹理3D模型的PartNeXt数据集，提供细粒度层次化部件标注。在两个任务上进行基准测试：类别无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答。

Result: 在部件分割任务中，现有SOTA方法在细粒度和叶级部件上表现不佳；在3D部件问答任务中，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距。使用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张RGB图像进行类别级8D姿态估计的方法，用于估计带关节的自行车和骑行者的姿态，包括车把和踏板的旋转参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于安全关键类别的弱势道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于骑行者的过街意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统的6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车关节部件（如车把和踏板）的变化，而这些变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出了一种联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点的模型，使用合成和真实图像数据进行混合训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。8D姿态包括3D平移、3D旋转以及车把和踏板相对于自行车车架的旋转。

Result: 该方法在8D姿态参数估计精度上表现出有希望的结果，与使用刚性规范对象模板进行匹配的最先进类别级6D姿态估计器相比，实现了有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 通过引入两个新的旋转参数（车把和踏板），该方法能够估计更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向，为自动驾驶系统中的自行车姿态估计提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效应对组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，通过多模态知识积累和自适应机制实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈(IB)框架来优化GAN，解决现有方法在解耦表示学习中的局限性，特别是InfoGAN在解耦能力上的不足。

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层作为可学习的潜在分布，通过约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息来实现解耦表示，采用端到端的联合训练方式。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAEs和Info-GAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面都表现出色，为无监督解耦学习提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中时间一致性与计算效率之间的权衡问题。现有方法在建模长期时间一致性时面临计算成本显著增加的挑战。

Method: 受人类两阶段决策过程启发，设计了Pick-and-Play Memory模块：Pick过程选择最相关帧，Play过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，维持紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段记忆机制有效平衡了时间一致性与计算效率，为增强现实等实时应用提供了实用的立体匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该研究为评估视频生成模型作为世界模拟器提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型在多智能体动力学模拟方面的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法比离散分类系统能实现更早检测和主动干预，显著提升安全应用中的可解释性和实用性

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle提出了一种基于流的无反转编辑框架，通过目标感知的中间状态构建，解决了现有文本到图像编辑方法在语义差距较大时编辑质量有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略了与特定编辑目标之间的语义差距，导致在所需修改与源图像差异较大时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: FlowCycle框架参数化可学习的噪声来进行图像破坏，通过循环一致过程优化这些噪声。通过迭代地将源图像编辑到目标图像并恢复回源图像的双重一致性约束，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 大量消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，实现了更忠实的修改同时保持源图像一致性，为文本到图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决大型视觉语言模型在长文本响应中的幻觉问题，通过实验验证了幻觉问题主要源于对上下文的依赖而非文本长度本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本响应时容易出现幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是由文本长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑这一机制并提出幻觉可能源于模型对上下文连贯性和完整性的过度依赖。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"三步框架：1）通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉；2）利用诱导的幻觉实例进行早期高风险检测；3）在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性，同时重新验证了关于上下文依赖导致幻觉的假设。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅提供了性能提升的方法，更重要的是为深入探索LVLMs长文本响应中的幻觉问题提供了新的见解和初步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Conclusion: COS3D通过有效整合语言和分割线索，为开放词汇3D分割提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出DualGround方法，通过双分支架构分离全局和局部语义，改进视频时序定位任务中的跨模态对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频时序定位方法在处理文本标记时忽视了不同语义角色的差异，过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义，无法有效利用词级信号进行细粒度时序对齐。

Method: 提出DualGround双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；采用token角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在时刻检索和高亮检测任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模能有效提升视频-语言对齐能力，同时改善全局句子级对齐和细粒度时序定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出了掩码位置编码(MPE)方案，利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计了上下文增强模块(CEM)，使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；构建了EDGeo端到端框架。

Result: 在两个公开数据集(CVOGL和VIGOR-Building)上的实验表明，该方法在挑战性的地面到卫星场景下实现了最先进的性能，定位精度提高了3.39%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，通过多模态共识引导融合过程，提升情感识别准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过多模态信息的多样性有效减少视觉特征冗余，显著提升视频异常检测效果

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Motivation: 解决复杂值合成孔径雷达图像识别中存在的表示三难问题——在数据有限和域偏移场景下，泛化性、可解释性和效率这三个目标之间存在冲突且难以同时优化。CV-SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征未被传统数据驱动模型充分利用。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core

original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual

TL;DR: 本文提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）开发出UI-Ins模型，在GUI grounding任务上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI grounding方法将指令视为静态用户意图代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集存在23.3%的指令缺陷，且利用指令多样性可带来76%的性能提升。

Method: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令作为动态分析路径。采用两阶段训练：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT）以培养多视角推理能力，然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个基准测试中达到SOTA：UI-I2E-Bench（87.3%）、ScreenSpot-Pro（57.0%）、MMBench-GUI L2（84.9%）。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上实现74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了GUI grounding性能，还展示了涌现推理能力，能够选择性组合和合成新的指令路径。研究还揭示了如何通过推理增强而非阻碍性能，以及如何缓解SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET是一种高效的多模态大语言模型训练范式，利用双曲空间动态调整半径来优化视觉表示与文本在任意粒度级别的对齐，仅需不到1%的额外参数即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要极高的计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP和SAM）缺乏与语言在多层次粒度上的对齐。双曲空间天然建模层次结构，为解决视觉和文本模态之间的粒度差距提供了理论基础。

Method: 提出HyperET训练范式，通过双曲空间中的动态双曲半径调整来优化视觉表示与文本的对齐。采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，实现三种高效参数化配置：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET能够一致地提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能，且仅需不到1%的额外参数。

Conclusion: HyperET通过双曲空间提供了一种原则性框架，有效解决了视觉和文本模态之间的粒度对齐问题，为MLLMs的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法在点云几何压缩中存在泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对分布外数据处理的低效性。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕捉鲁棒的上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在15个多样化数据集上的广泛实验表明，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，权重增加的边际比特成本远小于几何压缩带来的节省。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，导致性能下降。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant显式模拟扩散采样过程中的多个去噪步骤进行量化，考虑多步误差累积。提出高效实现技术，将内存复杂度从O(n)降至O(1)。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AccuQuant在各种任务和扩散模型上表现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型提供了高效且有效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现DiT的patch tokens具有惊人的独立性，即使位置编码被扰动，DiT仍能产生全局一致输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 引入位置编码场（PE-Field），将位置编码扩展到结构化3D场，包含深度感知编码用于体积推理和分层编码用于细粒度子patch控制。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务上达到最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: 通过将位置编码扩展到3D场，DiT能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，为视觉生成任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将其显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏差，从而在图像到食谱检索任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱中的细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致跨模态表示学习忽略非视觉但关键的食谱细节，特别是当训练数据包含不同菜系时偏差更严重。

Method: 提出因果表示学习方法，预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素（如细微配料和烹饪动作），并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习过程中，以减轻视觉主导的偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习方法能有效解决图像到食谱检索中的视觉偏差问题，通过挖掘非视觉的烹饪细节显著提升了检索准确性，特别是在多文化场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识蒸馏模型使用固定权重，无法有效处理医学图像中不同区域的不确定性变化，需要动态调整蒸馏权重

Method: 使用ViT-B32作为教师模型，MobileNet作为学生模型，通过模糊逻辑动态调整蒸馏权重；采用图像融合技术（Gamma校正、直方图均衡化、小波融合）提升图像质量；使用遗传算法从12个候选模型中选择最优学生模型

Conclusion: 该方法在不同成像域中表现出强鲁棒性，动态模糊知识蒸馏能有效处理医学图像不确定性，显著提升肺癌分类性能

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个基于证据的多步视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧推理以及自适应决策，解决了MLLMs在视频推理中的幻觉和定位不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的视频推理方法依赖纯文本链导致结论无依据，而帧检索方法虽然引入视觉基础但证据定位不准确。需要一种能够结合视觉证据和多步推理的方法。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action强化学习训练框架，联合增强多步视觉推理能力。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan相比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct平均准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能，并在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效解决了视频推理中的证据基础和推理准确性问题，展示了强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为多模态大语言模型的视频推理能力提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化（1-SDP），通过师生模型协同训练，在保持生成质量的同时提高个性化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单步文本到图像扩散模型虽然生成速度快，但在个性化新概念方面存在困难，因为单步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和单步扩散模型（学生），通过双向概念蒸馏机制，包括概念从教师到学生的蒸馏和从学生到教师的回传，并引入双向回传优化策略

Result: 实验表明该协作框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅增强了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还提高了教师模型的生成质量

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一种快速有效个性化的新范式

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext（FiFa）框架，通过细粒度面部区域划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了当前可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在局限性：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持对任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 1. 定义面部图像概念树（FICT）进行细粒度区域划分；2. 开发FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；3. 提出Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务；4. 构建统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线方法，在现有XDFA数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一的多任务架构，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，联合估计单张模糊图像中的潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，通过可解释的模块化架构实现高效去模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在处理严重或空间变化模糊时表现不佳。

Method: 利用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的恢复网络进行端到端训练，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能恢复清晰图像，还能揭示产生模糊的相机运动轨迹，并重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Result: 在TUM RGB-D、ICL-NUIM和TartanAir数据集上的评估显示，SELM-SLAM3比传统ORB-SLAM3平均提升87.84%，优于最先进的RGB-D SLAM系统36.77%。

Conclusion: 该框架在挑战性条件下表现出显著优势，为视觉障碍者导航辅助系统的开发提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced

scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光等）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致等问题，影响下游视觉任务性能

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。网络针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下具有良好的泛化能力。大量实验表明ACamera-Net能持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法

Conclusion: ACamera-Net是一种有效的相机参数自适应调整方案，无需依赖额外的图像增强模块即可显著改善复杂光照条件下的图像质量

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，将显式时空证据整合到视频推理中，通过精心收集的训练数据和训练策略解决视频推理中的时空追踪挑战，在多个基准测试上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型仅生成文本推理轨迹而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置，而将图像中的证据中心推理能力扩展到视频面临更大挑战，需要跨动态场景的联合时空定位。

Method: 首先构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，提供统一的时空监督和推理轨迹；然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励函数共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试上，Open-o3 Video相比Qwen2.5-VL基线将mAM提高14.4%，mLGM提高24.2%，在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准上均观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在颜色可控性方面存在不足，缺乏系统性的颜色精度评估基准。颜色作为视觉感知和沟通的基本要素，在艺术创作和品牌一致性等应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建了包含44K个颜色相关提示的基准测试，覆盖400多种颜色，包括数值颜色表示，通过感知和自动化评估方法进行测试。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度和失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench将指导精确颜色生成技术的改进，基准测试将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在域转移时性能急剧下降，无监督域适应可以避免对未见域进行昂贵标注

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性和区分性；使用字典存储不同图像的原型，防止类别缺失问题并实现对比学习

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架能有效缩小域差距，提升跨模态分割性能

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中自由移动物体重建的挑战，特别是在没有可靠位姿或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用第一帧作为锚点，通过密集高斯基元场逐步优化物体表示，核心是双键记忆模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，实现当前帧特征与时间聚合物体状态的鲁棒融合。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建，通过空间引导的内存读取和高效稀疏化机制，确保全面而紧凑的物体覆盖。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列时计算成本高且推理不聚焦不一致。现有帧选择方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整查询相关上下文。

Method: 提出训练无关、模型无关的SeViCES框架，包含两个关键模块：SVCFS模块通过时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支选择帧；ACR模块通过证据融合和答案空间约束解决语义与视觉预测的不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性上一致优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架证明了其在长视频理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D提出了一种新的因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过三阶段训练课程，解决了3D医学影像中高分辨率长序列处理的挑战，在报告生成和文本到CT合成任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D医学影像的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率长序列时存在困难：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐，切片级标记化模糊了精细解剖结构，降低了下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: BTB3D采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过三阶段训练课程：(i)局部重建，(ii)重叠窗口平铺，(iii)长上下文解码器精炼，从短切片片段学习但能泛化到超过300个切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务上，FID降低75%，FVD减半，能生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积图像。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化（而非仅使用更大的语言骨干网络）对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的数据集缺失和细粒度细节合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率文本到图像生成面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集，以及缺乏针对细粒度细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集：包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法：包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)，利用离散傅里叶变换增强高频细节保留。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高质量数据集和专门的训练策略，有效解决了超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的关键挑战，显著提升了生成图像的质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 废物分类错误导致垃圾填埋场堆积、回收效率低下和温室气体排放增加，需要智能高效的废物分类解决方案来支持可持续废物管理。

Method: 结合卷积特征提取（预训练ResNet-152）、可微分自组织映射（Soft-SOM）和脉冲神经时序处理，构建轻量级混合深度学习框架。

Result: 在十类废物数据集上实现97.39%的测试准确率，同时保持轻量计算特性，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: 该框架通过精确自动的废物分类支持更高回收效率，减少可回收流污染，降低废物处理生态和运营成本，符合联合国可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的多比特量化网络训练方法，通过权重偏差校正和位级核心集采样策略，显著减少了训练开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多比特量化网络方法存在训练开销大的问题，需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复全数据集更新，并且需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 提出了两种技术：(1) 权重偏差校正：通过共享批量归一化并消除微调需求，消除不同比特宽度间的量化诱导偏差并对齐激活分布；(2) 位级核心集采样策略：利用基于梯度的重要性分数为每个子模型选择紧凑且信息丰富的训练子集。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争性或更优精度的同时，将训练时间减少了最高7.88倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练效率问题，实现了高性能与低训练开销的平衡。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

### [70] [Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20707)
*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化多模态大语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，解决了现有方法只关注重要性而忽略模态特定语义冗余模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽略了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式。作者发现仅依赖重要性只能覆盖KV缓存信息分布的一个子集，可能导致语义覆盖的损失。

Method: MixKV方法通过分析注意力头间的语义冗余，在压缩KV对时选择性平衡多样性和重要性。该方法适应头级别的语义冗余，混合重要性和多样性进行优化压缩。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV在五个多模态理解基准上平均提升基线方法5.1%，在GUI grounding任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别实现了8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义冗余问题，通过混合重要性和多样性的策略显著提升了压缩性能，并且可以无缝扩展到LLMs中。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够实现从旋转LiDAR点云到无损距离图像的生成，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点损失和完整点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息丢失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法来支持高精度遥感应用。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断旋转LiDAR传感器的内在几何参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保存，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI实现了从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完全几何保存的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和有效的插值策略，显著提升了长时域驾驶场景生成的质量和一致性

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器模型在超高分辨率下训练成本极高，因为自注意力机制与图像token数量的平方成比例缩放。

Method: DyPE利用扩散过程固有的频谱进展特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整模型的位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配。

Conclusion: DyPE是一种有效的训练免费方法，能够在超高分辨率图像生成中实现卓越性能，特别是在更高分辨率下优势更加明显。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: MeanFlow框架的成功机制尚未完全理解，研究发现其目标函数存在轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个冲突部分，导致优化困难和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标函数家族，统一轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用从轨迹流匹配到MeanFlow的课程学习策略来解耦冲突目标。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256数据集上，α-Flow在不同规模和设置下均优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用标准DiT骨干网络取得了FID 2.58（1步）和2.15（2步）的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配管道：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精炼阶段整合姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Conclusion: Cupid通过将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，在统一的生成框架下实现了优越的3D重建性能，展示了在单图像3D重建任务中的有效性。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，但雷达能提供精确的3D距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达在目标跟踪中的关键作用

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机校准技术，通过特征匹配和类别一致性检查来关联两个传感器的检测结果

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型图像分割方法依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了模型捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Conclusion: 基于图像生成的分割框架能够有效克服离散表示的局限性，实现更精细的视觉感知。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV是一个无需训练的框架，通过结合多个轻量级草案专家和大型裁决模型，在信息密集型图像推理任务中实现成本效益和错误纠正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在信息密集型图像推理中表现不佳，主要挑战在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 提出推测裁决框架，包含草案阶段和裁决阶段。草案阶段使用小型VLMs生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段使用强VLM合成这些路径生成最终答案。引入共识专家选择机制，仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等挑战性基准测试中取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SV通过合成多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误纠正和成本效益。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一种基于物理引导的自监督高光谱超分辨率框架，通过解混瓶颈和线性混合实现可解释的融合，在单波段MSI下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低导致边界模糊和混合像素问题，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且在MSI波段很少时表现不佳。

Method: 使用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测类丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，以自监督方式通过MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线，与有监督基线相比也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI下也保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDDBM是一个基于潜在变量扩散模型的通用模态转换框架，能够在不同维度模态之间进行信息转换，解决了现有方法在共享维度、高斯先验和模态特定架构方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但扩展到跨模态转换仍面临挑战。现有方法依赖限制性假设，如共享维度、高斯源先验和模态特定架构，限制了其通用性和理论基础。

Method: 提出潜在去噪扩散桥模型（LDDBM），在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥梁，无需对齐维度。引入对比对齐损失确保配对样本的语义一致性，设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: LDDBM在多种模态转换任务上表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成。综合实验和消融研究验证了框架的有效性，建立了通用模态转换的新强基线。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换提供了一个强大且灵活的框架，支持任意模态对，在多个任务上取得了state-of-the-art性能，为跨模态生成建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个用于个性化多主体文本到图像生成的交互式框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制解决了现有方法在空间组合控制和多主体扩展方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，并且在处理多主体时扩展性差。

Method: 引入分层画布表示（每个主体放在独立层上实现无遮挡组合）和锁定机制（保持选定层高保真度，同时让其他层灵活适应上下文），无需架构修改，仅利用位置嵌入和新的互补数据采样策略。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优于现有方法的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的分层操作提供了专业级的图像编辑体验，显著提升了多主体生成的交互控制能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个解决文本到视频模型叙事连贯性问题的模型，通过整体生成整个场景确保全局一致性，实现了从片段合成到自动化电影制作的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型擅长生成孤立片段，但在创建连贯的多镜头叙事方面存在不足，无法满足真正的故事讲述需求。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，结合稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆能力以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: Kinaema模型通过隐式潜在记忆处理视觉观察流，实现机器人在大场景中的自定位和导航，无需显式存储观察历史，具有计算效率优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在连续操作中利用先前观察信息进行高效定位和导航的问题，特别是处理大规模场景中的长期记忆需求。

Method: 提出Kinaema模型，使用Transformer以循环方式更新隐式潜在记忆，压缩传感器读数历史为紧凑表示，支持查询图像的相对位置预测。

Result: 模型在Mem-Nav任务中表现出色，能够维持有用的场景表示，导航到episode开始前观察到的目标位置，计算效率优于基于观察历史注意力的传统Transformer。

Conclusion: 隐式潜在记忆方法为机器人长期空间感知提供了有效解决方案，在保持计算效率的同时实现了准确的位置预测和导航能力。

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶方法在领域偏移（如天气和光照变化）下的鲁棒性问题，不依赖额外数据。

Method: 集成视觉基础模型与基于扩散的规划方法，在CARLA仿真环境中训练，并以零样本方式迁移到对抗性环境。

Result: 在所有测试的分布外场景中，停车成功率均超过90%，消融研究证实网络架构和算法设计显著提升了跨域性能。

Conclusion: 在从真实世界停车场重建的3D高斯泼溅环境中测试显示出有前景的仿真到真实迁移能力。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到适当的希尔伯特空间构建随机特征，使用KLE分解将特征分解为可计算的不可约分量，通过特征值分解进行分类

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域实现了最先进的突破

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER在何时优于现有方法、其失效模式和其他局限性

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，通过将原型和编码器分别优化来消除原型崩溃，提高原型多样性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型崩溃问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样性和信息性目标的核心目的。现有方法通常通过过参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 提出完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器分别优化。具体来说，将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格的过程独立于编码器的损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化，产生了一致多样的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，提供了一种更有效和原则性的自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Motivation: 深度视觉模型在工业应用（如自主导航）中已成熟，但数据收集和标注成本高昂。特别是在关键应用中，训练数据需要覆盖所有可能条件（包括罕见场景）。生成合成图像是一种有吸引力的解决方案，可以廉价且可靠地覆盖所有条件和环境，前提是能缓解合成到真实的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEIcoder是一种生物信息驱动的解码方法，通过利用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，在小数据集上实现从初级视觉皮层单细胞活动重建视觉刺激的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据往往稀缺，高通量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战，需要克服数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出MEIcoder方法，整合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，特别针对小数据集和少神经元记录场景优化。

Result: 在仅1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练数据点的情况下，能够重建高保真自然图像，并创建了包含16万样本的统一基准数据集。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速、无需微调的LLM适配方法，通过选择性矩阵降维和少量样本评估，显著减少搜索时间并提升下游任务准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然有效但搜索成本过高，需要逐层全数据集前向传播，不适用于快速部署

Method: 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别关键层，允许矩阵行聚类到多个子空间分别分解，仅用100个样本评估梯度和准确率

Result: 方法将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，搜索时间大幅减少，实现了快速稳健的LLM适配

Conclusion: 结合关键层选择、多子空间分解和少量样本评估，实现了无需微调的快速LLM下游任务适配

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

*Mahtab Movaheddrad,Laurence Palmer,C. -C. Jay Kuo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GUSL-Dehaze是一种轻量级的图像去雾方法，将物理模型与绿色学习框架结合，避免了深度学习，采用U形架构和特征工程来减少参数数量并保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的图像去雾方法计算成本高、参数规模大，不适合资源受限设备，需要一种轻量、透明的替代方案。

Method: 使用改进的暗通道先验进行初始去雾，然后通过U形架构进行绿色学习，包括无监督表示学习和特征工程技术（RFT和LNT），最后通过透明监督学习获得去雾图像。

Result: GUSL-Dehaze显著减少了参数数量，同时保持数学可解释性，性能与最先进的深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限设备提供了一种有效的图像去雾解决方案，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Motivation: 解决早期现代宗教图像分类的挑战，传统图像和关键词搜索方法精度有限，需要更准确的分类工具来支持艺术史和数字人文研究

Method: 利用LLM生成包含视觉和文本元素的完整页面描述，通过混合向量搜索匹配Iconclass代码，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术

Result: 在五个和四个分类级别上分别达到87%和92%的精确度，显著优于传统图像和关键词搜索方法

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM和RAG技术在艺术史和数字人文研究中的巨大潜力，为大规模早期现代视觉档案分析提供了强大工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

### [98] [AI Pose Analysis and Kinematic Profiling of Range-of-Motion Variations in Resistance Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20012)
*Adam Diamant*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于AI的姿态估计流程，用于精确量化抗阻训练中的运动学特征。通过分析280个视频记录，发现局部幅度训练（pROM）与全幅度训练（fROM）在运动范围、执行动态和一致性方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于AI的方法来精确量化抗阻训练中的运动学特征，比较局部幅度训练和全幅度训练在执行动态上的差异，为抗阻训练处方的改进提供科学依据。

Method: 使用Wolf等人（2025）的视频数据，处理280个记录提取关节角度轨迹。通过滤波和平滑处理，计算每组的运动范围、节奏和向心/离心阶段持续时间等指标。应用随机效应元分析模型来考虑参与者和练习间的变异性。

Result: pROM重复动作的运动范围更小，总持续时间更短，特别是在离心阶段。方差分析显示参与者个体差异是变异的主要驱动因素。新指标%ROM显示局部幅度训练在不同练习中保持相对一致。

Conclusion: 局部幅度训练不仅在全幅度上不同于全幅度训练，在执行动态和一致性方面也存在差异。基于AI的方法具有推进研究和改进抗阻训练处方的潜力。

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.
