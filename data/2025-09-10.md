### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应具有鲁棒性的细胞形态学基础表征，能够在无需微调的情况下有效泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型仍是关键障碍。

Method: 提出CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文令牌设计，支持有效的分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基础模型的重要进展，可实现更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比纯视觉方法提升精度0.2个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在过度检测问题，特别是在外观相似的正常结构元素情况下表现有限

Method: 基于领域规则构建多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer整合多层特征图（第7、16、19层）和合成音频表示，实现音频与图像的融合

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验评估显示，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和总体准确率提升0.2个百分点，学生t检验证实了平均准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能够有效提升铁路缺陷检测的精度和准确性，解决了单模态方法的局限性

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重正交分解获得类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来识别分布外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用，因此需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方案。

Method: 使用分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间，将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示，通过计算子空间内的特征重构误差来确定OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理方法，解决了数据隐私场景下的OOD检测问题，性能优越且无需训练数据。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可将任何基础模型引导至新的数据分布，无需标签和额外超参数，仅需1000张图像即可显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，可用数据集通常很小，限制了大规模预训练SSL方法的适用性，且预训练模型通常只发布骨干权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息。

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，采用非常简单的目标函数，无需标签，引入的超参数不超过监督微调，适用于不同数据模态和骨干网络选择。

Result: 该方法在各种数据模态和骨干网络选择上表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP成功填补了基础模型适应新目标域的空白，提供了一种简单有效的持续预训练解决方案。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法存在对抗攻击脆弱性问题，特别是在非IID设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距，导致下游任务误分类。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为"信标"生成全局对齐的视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，且在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务评估开源VLM，并提出了创新的BlockWeaver算法来处理OCR输出比较问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，特别是社交媒体内容分析等复杂业务场景，需要建立更贴近企业部署要求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法处理无序OCR输出比较，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行综合评估。

Result: 在领先开源VLM（Qwen、MIMO、InternVL）与专有基线的对比评估中，ViLD提供了首个基于行业实践的任务驱动能力评估，为企业部署提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功建立了学术研究与实际企业需求之间的桥梁，为开源VLM在企业环境中的有效部署提供了实用的评估标准和解决方案。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一种自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著提升医学影像AI模型的泛化能力和校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了纯图像网络在不同机构间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部信息作为标签，使用三种方法联合建模：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换，获得协议感知的临床鲁棒图像表示。

Result: 在126万项研究（7个医疗系统，31台扫描仪，3个厂商）上验证，在肺栓塞CT分诊、脑胶质瘤MRI分级和心胸比异常检测任务中，AUROC提升0.041-0.058，校准性能改善25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome方法能有效减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统部署，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包含去标识化和偏倚审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在干净文本上表现良好，但在字符分割、融合、遮挡等扰动下识别能力显著下降，显示出与人类文字识别韧性存在差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究先进视觉语言模型是否具备人类对文字破碎、融合、部分遮挡等扰动的识别韧性

Method: 构建两个心理物理学启发的基准测试（中文象形文字和英文拼音文字），通过拼接、重组和叠加字形来生成对模型"可见但不可读"但对人类仍可读的刺激

Result: 当代VLMs在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生不相关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而缺乏组合性先验

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁需要编码符号分割、组合和跨脚本绑定的架构和训练策略，为多模态系统在教育、可访问性、文化遗产和安全等领域的部署划定了具体挑战

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在频域进行特征级学习的动态心脏MRI重建方法，通过时间融合策略合成k空间数据，在低数据条件下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像的动态和复杂特性导致高质量k空间数据稀缺，限制了动态心脏MRI的鲁棒重建

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，采用时间融合策略集成跨时间帧的k空间数据来优化生成轨迹

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法有望缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估模型能否在语义和感知差异大的类别间泛化属性知识，发现当训练和测试集相关性降低时性能急剧下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型是否能够跨不同类别抽象和应用属性知识，解决现有研究局限于相似领域的问题

Method: 引入基于LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类别分区的多种训练测试集划分策略，逐步减少相关性

Result: 性能随着训练测试集相关性降低而急剧下降，聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性之间取得最佳平衡

Conclusion: 当前模型表示存在局限性，对划分策略敏感，为未来属性推理基准构建提供重要见解

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种人机协同的定量评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的3D模型质量，通过多种相似性和复杂性指标来比较生成模型与真实CAD参考模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能够处理多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但评估几何和结构保真度的稳健方法仍然不足，需要开发系统化的评估框架来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型等应用。

Method: 提出综合评估指标套件（体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度、拓扑复杂性），以L型支架为案例，系统比较四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树、代码级修正提示）下的LLM性能。

Result: 研究发现语义丰富度越高生成保真度越好，代码级提示在所有指标上都实现了完美重建。定量评估方法相比传统定性方法能显著加快向真实模型的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和完善各种CAD应用的生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术内存消耗高，限制了在边缘设备上的应用，现有压缩方法主要关注存储压缩而忽略了渲染内存的关键瓶颈

Method: 用轻量级任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示，并提出统一的软剪枝框架将基元数量和瓣数剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题

Result: 相比现有方法实现了50%的静态VRAM减少和40%的渲染VRAM减少，同时保持相当的渲染质量

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数配置，在显著降低内存使用的同时保持了渲染性能，为解决3DGS在边缘设备上的应用提供了有效方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的正则化损失，强制样本符合标准高斯分布，便于在文本到图像模型的潜在空间中进行优化。结合空间域的矩正则化和频谱域的功率谱正则化，为下游任务提供统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种更全面、高效的正则化方法来促进潜在空间样本的标准高斯分布，以支持文本到图像模型的下游优化任务。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准高斯变量，定义复合损失函数：空间域使用矩正则化，频谱域使用功率谱正则化。通过随机排列输入确保排列不变性。

Result: 新正则化方法优于现有高斯性正则化，有效防止奖励破解，加速收敛。在生成建模中成功应用于文本到图像模型的测试时奖励对齐，提升美学质量和文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 提出的复合正则化框架统一了现有方法，提供更高效的高斯性约束，在文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化中表现出色，为下游任务提供了有效的正则化工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Motivation: 基础模型如SAM存在大量不透明的调优参数，需要大量手动优化，限制了在实时流数据分析中的使用

Method: 构建基于物理成像系统特性的奖励函数（如颗粒尺寸分布、几何形状等），通过奖励驱动的优化框架来微调SAM模型

Conclusion: 奖励函数优化方法有效提升了基础模型在显微镜图像分割中的性能，实现了更精确的细胞结构、材料界面和纳米尺度特征分析

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational

### [17] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，对13个商业大型多模态模型的性别偏见进行大规模分析，发现模型不仅复制还放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在明显的默认男性偏见，但不同模型差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型可能在生成图像时延续训练数据中的有害社会偏见，先前研究存在方法学限制，无法进行大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，在13个商业LMM中生成人物图像，涵盖刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业，使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张图像进行性别表征评分。

Result: LMM系统性放大职业性别刻板印象（男性在男性刻板职业中占93.0%，女性刻板职业中仅22.5%）；存在强烈默认男性偏见（非刻板职业中男性占68.3%）；不同模型偏见程度差异显著（46.7%-73.3%）。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果而是设计选择的结果，最佳模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，强调需要标准化自动化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 提出基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，解决多视图重建中全局注意力层的二次复杂度瓶颈，实现4倍推理加速且性能相当


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）存在全局注意力层的二次复杂度瓶颈，限制了在大规模图像集上的可扩展性

Method: 分析全局注意力矩阵发现注意力集中在少量跨视图几何匹配的patch交互上，受大语言模型启发，使用高度优化的块稀疏核替代密集全局注意力操作

Result: 推理速度提升4倍，任务性能相当，无需重新训练主干网络，支持VGGT和π³模型及大规模图像集

Conclusion: 块稀疏注意力机制是解决多视图重建中注意力计算效率问题的有效方案，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的VIO攻击检测与恢复机制，通过训练学习正常运动时序规律来检测运行时偏差并恢复姿态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，微小的姿态欺骗攻击可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。

Method: 在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复机制以恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示相比无防御基线，轨迹和姿态误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，提高系统安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究面部增强技术在改善感知质量的同时，是否会对深度伪造检测器的性能产生负面影响，并探讨其作为反取证工具的潜力。

Method: 系统评估传统图像处理方法和基于GAN的增强技术对深度伪造检测器的影响，包括Naïve、空间和频域检测方法，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验显示基础增强滤镜可将检测准确率降低64.63%，GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞，攻击成功率高达75.12%。

Conclusion: 面部增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，突显了需要更强大和自适应的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量人工标注数据，但在现实应用中，新类别可能随时出现。现有方法主要关注半监督学习，而本文探索完全无监督的新类发现方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并整合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示，提升图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet等数据集上，无论聚类数量已知还是未知，都实现了最先进的单模态聚类和新类发现结果。

Conclusion: 证明了完全无监督方法在新类发现任务中的有效性，为开放世界场景下的图像分类提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示、双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本提示，在乳腺超声分割中实现了最先进的性能，特别改善了小病灶的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对可靠测量和定量分析很重要，但小病灶或低对比度病灶由于边界模糊和斑点噪声而难以准确分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索往往会产生粗糙的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，包含全局路径（基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整体图像语义）和局部路径（U-Net强调精确边界）。使用从结构化元数据自动生成的文本提示来描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语，无需手动标注。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到Dice系数0.8765和IoU 0.8149的最优性能，超越六个强基线模型。小病灶改善最明显，减少了漏检区域和虚假激活。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补作用。

Conclusion: 将全局语义与局部精度相结合的双提示双分支多模态设计能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，并提高对小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Result: 达到98.0%准确率和98.1%灵敏度，显著优于传统方法和ProGAN基线

Conclusion: 验证了先进生成模型与可解释特征融合的协同效应，为高精度医学诊断工具开发提供了有效方案

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，通过视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集文本提示，实现多模态模型中视觉理解和生成的重新对齐，显著提升生成和编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖的图像-文本对标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百个词描述简单图像也存在信息缺失问题。

Method: 引入重建对齐(RecA)方法，利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为密集文本提示，通过自监督重建损失优化模型重构输入图像，实现理解和生成的重新对齐。

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升图像生成性能，编辑基准ImgEdit(3.38→3.75)和GEdit(6.94→7.25)也有明显改进，超越更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: RecA作为一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种多模态架构，包括自回归、掩码自回归和基于扩散的模型，能够一致提升生成和编辑保真度。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态融合互补性、小目标建模易受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合，减少冗余信息影响

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测任务上表现优异，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，通过线性复杂度的Mamba架构实现了高性能检测

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 现有图卷积网络在骨架动作识别中虽然有效，但在区分模糊动作时存在局限性，对学习到的拓扑和空间特征表示不足。

Method: 结合高斯滤波器优化骨架拓扑图表示，并集成门控循环单元到GCN框架中，增强骨架点间的信息传播能力。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中，G^3CN显著提升了动作识别性能，特别是在模糊样本上表现突出。

Conclusion: G^3CN方法通过拓扑优化和门控机制有效提升了图卷积网络对模糊动作的区分能力，具有很好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL方法，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征以保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，并使用递归双向交叉注意力

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的多模态交互机制，提升了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计性能，代码将公开发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Result: 大量定量和定性实验证明LGAA在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型中表现优异，模块化设计支持灵活集成多个扩散先验，知识保留方案实现高效收敛。

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质建模，在数据效率和高性能方面表现出色，代码和预训练权重将公开。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

*Taiying Peng,Jiacheng Hua,Miao Liu,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型在自我中心视频问答中的表现，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，而自我中心视频通过统一坐标系直接捕捉用户关注点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会。

Method: 构建EgoGazeVQA基准，包含由MLLMs生成并经人工标注的注视相关QA对；开发注视引导的意图提示方法，整合空间、时间和意图相关线索。

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升性能；注视估计精度影响提示效果，注视相关微调实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心场景中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值，EgoGazeVQA基准填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLEAM是一个跨视角地理定位框架，包含GLEAM-C多模态对齐模型和GLEAM-X可解释推理任务，统一了无人机图像、街景地图、全景视图和地面照片与卫星图像的匹配，并通过MLLM实现可解释的地理定位分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CVGL方法局限于单一视图或模态，且缺乏解释性的问题。传统方法仅预测图像是否对应，无法解释匹配依据。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：GLEAM-C通过优化实现将多视图多模态数据与卫星图像对齐；GLEAM-X利用多模态大语言模型进行可解释推理，并使用GPT-4o和Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro构建双语基准数据集。

Conclusion: GLEAM框架将多模态多视图对齐与可解释对应分析相结合，统一了准确的跨视图匹配与可解释推理，推动了地理定位的透明度和可扩展性发展。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个新颖的深度学习框架，通过交叉维度监督和多尺度特征融合网络，实现视网膜层感知的血管重建，显著提升OCT到OCTA转换的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建精细血管细节，影响可靠诊断。

Method: 提出XOCT框架，集成交叉维度监督(CDS)模块和多尺度特征融合(MSFF)网络。CDS利用2D分层投影作为监督信号，MSFF通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略增强血管描绘。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上的实验表明，XOCT在en-face投影方面有显著改进，这对于视网膜病理的临床评估至关重要。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的后处理偏置缓解方法，通过在三个基准数据集上的实验证明，该方法能显著减少子群体差异，最高可将人口统计均等性提升97.37%，且准确率损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中常依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的后处理模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，研究了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏，在CUB-200-2011（姿态偏置）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏置）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏置）三个基准数据集上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘能显著减少子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计均等性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10上提升30.28%，CelebA上提升97.37%。这些增益在准确率损失最小的情况下实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL提供了一个实用高效的视频内容创建和编辑解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的视频背景替换。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Method: 将图像分割成非重叠补丁，独立分类每个补丁，然后聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可可视化每个补丁的诊断贡献。

present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image

independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将隐式神经表示与扩散模型结合，有效弥合了矢量图形与扩散模型之间的领域差距，实现了高质量的矢量图形动画自动生成

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了室内导航的性能，增强了视障人士的可访问性和独立性。

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在真实感视图合成方面表现出色，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，实现准确完整的表面重建仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出DiGS框架，将符号距离场(SDF)学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯关联可学习SDF值，并设计几何引导的网格增长策略在多尺度层次下自适应分布高斯。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS持续提高了重建准确性和完整性，同时保持了高渲染保真度。

Conclusion: DiGS通过整合SDF学习到3DGS中，有效解决了表面重建的挑战，实现了几何一致性和高质量重建的统一。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感图像非定向对抗攻击的新方法，通过局部混合和logits优化来解决现有方法破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失的问题，在多个数据集上显著提升了黑盒攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在遥感应用中容易受到对抗攻击，现有混合策略要么全局混合图像要么直接交换区域，这会破坏全局语义特征并误导对抗样本优化，同时交叉熵损失会导致迭代更新中的梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出了基于局部混合和logits优化的框架：1）局部混合策略生成多样且语义一致的输入；2）将目标攻击中的logit损失适应到非定向场景；3）应用扰动平滑损失抑制高频噪声。

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在6个替代模型上优于12种最先进方法，其中在MTARSI上使用ResNet作为替代模型时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提高了17.28%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部混合保持语义一致性，使用logits优化避免梯度消失，结合扰动平滑增强可转移性，为提升对抗样本的跨模型迁移能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法依赖2D框标注但存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督3D检测方法

Method: 提出MVAT框架：使用时序多视图聚合物体点云构建完整3D表示；采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态物体；学生网络从单视图预测伪标签；引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与2D标注一致性

Conclusion: MVAT通过有效利用时序多视图信息和蒸馏学习，成功实现了无需3D标注的高质量3D检测，为弱监督3D感知提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture

### [41] [Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530)
*Kiet T. Nguyen,Chanhuyk Lee,Donggyun Kim,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够在仅用30个标注样本的情况下适应新的空间控制任务，并在多种扩散模型架构上实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应能力有限且训练成本高，需要一种更通用的少样本控制方法。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小量任务特定参数的更新来实现泛化。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上的实验表明，UFC仅用30个标注样本就能实现与空间条件一致的细粒度控制，使用0.1%的训练数据即可达到与全监督基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本控制适配器，可应用于不同的扩散模型架构（UNet和DiT），在少样本设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Hounsfield Unit的掩码策略来改进3D医学图像中的MIM方法，通过关注内脏器官强度分布，排除无诊断意义的非组织区域，在多个数据集上显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MIM方法在3D医学图像计算中使用随机掩码，忽视了解剖对象的密度特征，无法充分利用医学图像中的诊断相关信息。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit测量值实现基于HU的前景掩码策略，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等缺乏诊断意义的非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学影像数据集上验证，分割质量和Dice分数均有显著提升（BTCV:84.64%、Flare22:92.43%、MM-WHS:90.67%、Amos22:88.64%、BraTS:78.55%）。

Conclusion: 领域特定的MIM方法对于医学图像表示学习具有重要意义，为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Motivation: 文档图像蕴含丰富知识，语音查询具有便携性和灵活性，但此前没有研究探索在视觉文档图像上进行语音问答的知识库问答任务。

Method: 采用完全无文本的端到端流水线，集成布局感知重排序机制来优化检索，直接解释语音、检索相关视觉知识并生成答案。

Result: 实验显示在效率和准确性方面都有显著提升，并发布了首个双语语音-文档RAG数据集（中英文语音查询与多模态文档内容配对）。

Conclusion: TextlessRAG框架为语音驱动的文档图像问答提供了有效解决方案，推动了该研究方向的发展，数据集和流水线将开源供研究使用。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

TL;DR: 提出一种从单张无姿态图像快速合成高斯全头模型的框架，无需耗时GAN反演和测试时优化，通过前向传播实现快速重建和渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖耗时的GAN反演和测试时优化，无法实现快速的头模型重建和渲染，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用大规模合成数据集训练，提出从粗到细的高斯头生成管道，通过FLAME模型稀疏点与图像特征交互进行特征提取和粗重建，然后细化实现高保真重建；采用双分支框架聚合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架相比现有工作具有更好的效果，能够实现快速且高质量的头模型重建。

Conclusion: 该框架通过前向传播方式实现了从单张图像快速重建高斯全头模型，在效率和重建质量方面均优于现有方法，为实时头模型合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: 提出CGAT架构用于3D形状识别，通过图注意力机制和可视化解释来提高深度学习模型在关键应用中的可信度和可解释性，在牙齿发育阶段分类任务中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学等关键领域的应用受到黑盒特性的限制，需要可解释的模型来建立信任和问责机制，特别是在3D形状识别任务中。

Method: 使用Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，结合图注意力卷积和注意力机制可视化（attention rollout），评估局部平均曲率和质心距离等节点特征。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离的特征组合获得0.76加权F1分数，产生更全面的注意力可视化，带有指向全局CLS节点的有向边模型产生更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强模型可信度并促进专家验证，虽然基于牙科数据演示，但可广泛应用于基于图的分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: 时间图像取证技术需要更可靠的验证方法，可解释AI对于验证技术可靠性至关重要，提出了更现实的取证设置来改进该领域的研究。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估容易受到非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰，研究发现即使轻微扰动也能显著改变偏见分数，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有性别偏见评估基准中存在非性别特征与性别之间的虚假相关性，质疑这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，量化它们对偏见评估的影响

Result: 即使最小扰动（如掩码10%物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见分数：生成式VLMs指标变化达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估往往反映模型对虚假特征而非性别偏见的响应，建议同时报告偏见指标和特征敏感性测量以提高评估可靠性

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型未能充分利用患者元数据，缺乏临床诊断知识整合，在3D医学影像上效果有限，且需要大量计算资源

Method: 1) 将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2) 添加预测MMSE评分的辅助标记提供额外监督；3) 对图像和文本模态应用轻量级提示微调

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个AD数据集上实现了最先进性能，优于使用10,000张图像微调的现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用元数据和临床知识，以数据高效的方式成功将3D CT模型适配到MRI，在AD诊断中表现出色

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法对大量标注数据的依赖问题，以及缺乏可解释性的表征学习问题。

Method: 自监督跨编码器框架，通过对比学习约束静态表征捕获稳定解剖特征，通过输入梯度正则化引导动态表征反映时间变化，可用于下游分类任务的微调。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标注数据依赖和可解释性问题，具有优秀的泛化性能，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在潜在扩散模型中面临频率完整性损失导致的检测性能下降问题，以及对裁剪攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法，通过强制Hermitian对称保持频率完整性；引入中心感知嵌入策略确保裁剪后信息保留；改进现有语义水印方案的频域结构。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，检测准确率最高同时保持优异的图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)，消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: SFW是平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的有效框架，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Result: 在两个高度不同的挑战性任务上实现最先进性能：多帧红外小目标检测和空间目标检测

Conclusion: 该方法展示了有效性和泛化能力，无需对目标特征做过多假设即可实现鲁棒的小目标检测

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持较低计算成本的同时，显著提升了配准精度和效率，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现优异但易受对抗样本攻击，标准对抗训练未能显式处理类间特征重叠这一关键问题。

Method: 识别每个对抗样本的最近类间邻居，在特征空间中移除这些邻居的投影以增强特征可分性，并通过理论证明logits校正可降低Lipschitz常数和Rademacher复杂度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN等标准基准测试中表现出色，在鲁棒性和清洁准确率方面均取得显著成果。

Conclusion: 显式处理类间特征邻近性对于增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法充分捕捉不同语义区域的统计特性差异。

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个语义区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，编码解码延迟极小，并支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码。

Conclusion: SEEC通过语义分割指导的多熵模型方法有效提升了无损图像压缩性能，在保持高效率的同时支持灵活的ROI编码。

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的多模态网络XSRD-net，结合影像和临床数据，用于卒中复发检测和复发时间预测，取得较好性能并发现心脏疾病与颈动脉的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中复发率高达5-25%，复发死亡率达40%，亟需早期识别高风险患者以制定适当治疗计划。

Method: 收集2010-2024年卒中患者的3D颅内CTA影像数据、心脏病史、年龄和性别，训练单模态和多模态深度学习网络进行二元复发检测（任务1）和无复发生存时间预测及分类（任务2）。

Result: 任务1的表格数据AUC达0.84；任务2的多模态模型c-index为0.68，AUC为0.71，视觉和表格模态贡献比为0.68:0.32。可解释性分析显示心脏病（表格）和颈动脉（视觉）与复发检测和RFS时间预测相关。

Conclusion: 多模态方法在卒中复发预测中表现良好，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉病变的关联，这一重要发现将通过持续数据收集和模型重训练进一步验证。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯泼溅技术，提出多阶段毛发重建方法，从多视角图像重建发丝级几何，并通过新颖评估指标衡量拓扑准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模对毛发重建需求增长，现有方法忽视发丝连通性和拓扑结构，需要更准确的重建方法

Method: 多阶段管道：先用可微分高斯光栅化器重建细节几何，再通过合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下优化生长

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，能稳健处理多种发型，重建效率高（通常1小时内完成）

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展3DGS框架实现发丝级重建，提出的拓扑评估指标填补了现有评估空白

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

TL;DR: RayGaussX是RayGauss的加速版本，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化和新的致密化标准，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时提高了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染，需要开发加速方案。

Method: 在RayGauss基础上引入体积渲染加速策略（空域跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化减少误报交点，以及新的致密化标准改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速、50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的加速效果，适用于更大场景的实时渲染应用。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学MR成像中扫描时间与图像质量之间的平衡问题，避免放射科医生单独分析低分辨率扫描的耗时和不准确问题

Method: 使用多视角神经网络进行自监督训练，引入稀疏坐标损失函数，结合患者无关的离线阶段和患者特定的在线阶段

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上评估，相比最先进的自监督超分辨率方法，在不同上采样尺度下获得相当或更好的性能，患者特定重建速度提升高达10倍

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MR成像中的分辨率-时间权衡问题，为医学图像分析提供了快速且高质量的解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知精炼，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射技术虽然能创建高质量3D场景表示，但在修复遮挡或编辑导致的缺失区域时仍面临模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的挑战。

Method: 结合两种关键思想：(1)联合深度和对象监督确保修复的高斯点在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)一致性感知精炼方案选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越现有NeRF和3DGS修复方法，训练时间减少24.5%，能提供更清晰的细节、更少伪影和更好的视角一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性精炼，有效解决了3DGS场景修复的关键问题，实现了高质量和高效率的修复效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D分割方法存在表示不对齐问题：LLM处理高级语义token而点云只有密集几何结构，限制了输入输出性能

Method: 提出Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合语义和几何信息进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了LLM与3D点云表示不对齐问题，实现了鲁棒的3D理解

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Result: 在标准图像描述基准上相对改进53%，VQA任务准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，效率损失可忽略

Conclusion: D-LEAF通过细粒度注意力分析有效抑制MLLM幻觉，提供了一种任务无关的动态修正方案

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级相关性，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Result: 在最大规模数据集CBCT-IOS3.8K上验证，达到最先进性能，DSC指标显著提升，具有良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个有效的多模态牙齿分割预训练框架，为数字牙科提供了准确可靠的分割解决方案

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 针对消费级硬件上的目标检测性能瓶颈问题，提出了两阶段自适应推理算法，在RTX 4060等资源受限设备上实现1.85倍加速，仅损失5.51% mAP精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标检测模型的基准测试性能与实际在消费级硬件上的表现存在显著差距，高性能指标通常在桌面级GPU上获得，而在资源受限系统上存在系统级瓶颈

Method: 提出两阶段自适应推理算法：首先进行快速低分辨率检测，仅在检测置信度低时才升级到高分辨率模型。采用模型无关方法，无需架构修改，比较了架构早退和分辨率自适应路由策略

Result: 在5000张COCO数据集图像上测试，相比PyTorch早退基线实现1.85倍加速，mAP精度损失仅为5.51%

Conclusion: 通过将重点从纯模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，为在消费级设备上部署高性能实时AI提供了实用且可复现的解决方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于引导扩散模型的解码器，可以生成特征与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，用于分析深度神经网络的特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒问题，通过生成特征匹配的图像来揭示图像中哪些属性被编码到特定特征中。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化估计图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与用户指定特征高度相似，并揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络特征编码提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual-TableQA，一个大规模开放领域的多模态数据集，专门用于评估和增强对复杂表格数据的视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在表格图像上的视觉推理基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在限制，需要更全面的数据集来推动视觉语言模型的发展。

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的自动生成流水线，使用多个推理LLM协作完成生成、验证和启发等不同角色，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤实现多模型协作数据生成。

Result: 构建了包含2.5k个丰富结构的LaTeX渲染表格和6k个推理密集型QA对的数据集，成本低于100美元。微调模型在外部基准测试中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越多个专有模型。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA为表格视觉推理提供了高质量的数据集资源，证明了合成数据生成方法的有效性，为相关研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3是一个大型多模态模型系统，通过扩展工具交互实现深度多轮推理（可达数十步），在视觉搜索任务中达到最先进性能，解决了现有方法推理模式单调和交互轮次有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源方法在视觉问题上存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，无法胜任需要试错探索的困难任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理模式轨迹、提出超轮次掩码策略避免强化学习中惩罚超轮次响应。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互上限训练后，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，能够有效解决挑战性视觉搜索问题。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过深度多轮推理和多样化推理模式，成功解决了现有方法在复杂视觉任务中的局限性，展示了强大的视觉搜索能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen：通过粗到精对齐和文本引导域随机化，实现单张参考图像下的未知物体6D位姿估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张参考图像估计未知物体6D位姿的挑战：3D模型稀缺、单视角重建缺乏度量尺度、生成模型与真实图像间的域差距

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块联合优化尺度和位姿，结合多视角特征匹配和渲染-比较优化；使用文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，实现合成数据有效微调

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准上达到最先进性能，远超先前方法；真实机器人手验证了灵巧抓取的稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视角3D生成支持可靠的一次性6D位姿估计，在实际操作中具有实用性

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL方法通过将多模态大语言模型的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，来提升视觉中心任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是仅使用文本监督导致视觉细节丢失

Method: 提出VIRAL正则化策略，将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型的表示进行对齐，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识

Result: 在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中所有任务上都取得了一致性改进

Conclusion: 这种简单的对齐方法为在MLLMs训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决高密度库存条件下食品检测的挑战，包括物品重叠、遮挡视图和不同角度拍摄导致的识别和计数不准确问题，旨在减少食物浪费并优化家庭消费。

Method: 系统分为三个核心模块：数据预处理、目标检测与管理、基于Web的可视化。采用改进的focal loss变体，通过温度缩放实现自适应类别误差校准，解决模型预测过度自信和信心不足的问题。

Result: 稳健的功能性校准显著提高了在不同光照条件和可扩展性挑战下的检测可靠性，实现了更准确的食品识别和计数。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种实用、以用户为中心的现代食品管理方法，通过减少浪费和更明智的消费推动了可持续生活目标的实现。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

TL;DR: SVGauge是首个针对文本到SVG生成的人类对齐参考评估指标，结合视觉保真度和语义一致性评估，在SVG评估中比现有指标更符合人类判断


<details>

Motivation: 现有的图像评估指标（如FID、LPIPS、CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号性和矢量特性评估需求

Method: SVGauge联合测量：1）通过提取SigLIP图像嵌入并利用PCA和白化进行域对齐的视觉保真度；2）通过比较BLIP-2生成的SVG描述与原始提示在SBERT和TF-IDF组合空间中的语义一致性

Result: 在SHE基准测试中，SVGauge与人类判断的相关性最高，比现有指标更准确地重现了八个零样本LLM生成器的系统级排名

Conclusion: 结果强调了矢量特定评估的必要性，并为未来文本到SVG生成模型的基准测试提供了实用工具

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有神经辐射度方法主要依赖位置特征编码，在捕捉高频、强视角依赖的辐射分布方面存在明显局限性

Method: 使用预滤波多分辨率哈希网格精确近似光泽BSDF波瓣，通过连续空间聚合将视角依赖反射特性直接嵌入编码过程

Result: 在各种光泽度条件下实时生成高质量无噪渲染，相比基线方法具有更高的保真度和真实感

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升网络建模高频反射分布的能力，还能有效处理从高光到低光等各种光泽度表面，同时保持架构紧凑高效

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning

pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

Conclusion: 核化自监督学习目标是连接经典核方法与现代表示学习的有前景方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Alexandrovna Studenikina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCond是一种基于PCGrad原理的高效梯度冲突解决方法，通过梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，在保持优化质量的同时实现两倍计算加速，并在多个数据集和模型架构上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题严重，现有方法如PCGrad、CAGrad和GradNorm计算成本高，限制了其在大模型和transformer中的应用。

Method: 提出Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，支持随机模式实现计算加速。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈部CT扫描数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上都表现出优越性能，实现了更低的L1和SSIM损失，并成功应用于从紧凑模型到大型架构的各种模型。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，与现代优化器兼容，具有很高的实用价值。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

TL;DR: 结合EfficientNet深度学习模型与数字孪生系统的新型框架，用于心脏骤停的早期检测和分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏骤停是全球重大健康问题，早期识别和管理对改善患者预后至关重要

Method: 使用EfficientNet深度学习模型学习心血管图像特征，同时通过IoT设备数据构建个性化数字孪生心血管系统模型

Result: 实验表明系统具有高准确性的预测能力和高效性

Conclusion: 深度学习与数字孪生技术的结合为心脏疾病预测提供了主动化和个体化的新途径

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DepthVision是一个多模态场景理解框架，通过将稀疏LiDAR点云合成为RGB图像，并与真实RGB数据动态融合，在视觉输入退化时提升机器人操作的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉输入退化或不足时机器人操作可靠性问题，特别是在黑暗、运动模糊等传感器退化情况下。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络（GAN）和细化网络从稀疏LiDAR点云合成RGB图像，通过亮度感知模态适应（LAMA）根据环境光照条件动态融合合成视图和真实RGB数据。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的评估显示，在低光照条件下性能显著提升，相比仅使用RGB的基线方法有实质性改进，同时保持与冻结视觉语言模型的兼容性。

Conclusion: LiDAR引导的RGB合成方法在现实环境中实现鲁棒机器人操作方面具有巨大潜力，无需对下游视觉语言模型进行微调即可补偿传感器退化。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于SSD-Mamba2的视觉驱动跨模态强化学习框架，用于运动控制，相比现有方法在计算效率、安全性和样本效率方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端强化学习运动控制方法存在计算-内存权衡不佳、长时程信用分配困难以及二次计算成本高等问题，需要更高效的融合框架

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2选择性状态空间骨干网络，将本体感知状态和外感知观察编码为紧凑token，通过堆叠层进行融合，采用课程学习和状态中心奖励函数

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，该方法在回报、安全性（碰撞和跌倒）和样本效率方面均超越现有最优基线，收敛速度更快

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为可扩展、有前瞻性和高效的端到端运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干网络

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

TL;DR: 深度学习MRI重建算法DeepFoqus-Accelerate可实现四倍加速的脑部MRI扫描，在保持诊断质量的同时减少75%扫描时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习MRI重建算法在四倍加速扫描下是否能保持诊断质量，提高MRI工作流程效率

Method: 使用公共和前瞻性临床数据，对相位编码欠采样的2D/3D T1、T2和FLAIR序列进行重建，与标准护理(SOC)对比，由神经放射科医生和MRI技师进行5点Likert量表评估，并使用SSIM、PSNR和HaarPSI进行定量相似性分析

Result: 所有AI重建扫描评分均≥3分(最低可接受)，95%评分≥4分；平均SSIM为0.95±0.03，PSNR>41.0 dB，HaarPSI>0.94；罕见伪影不影响诊断解释

Conclusion: DeepFoqus-Accelerate算法能够实现稳健的四倍脑部MRI加速，在保持诊断图像质量的同时显著提高工作流程效率

Abstract: This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动视网膜层分割耗时且存在变异性，传统深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，需要开发既准确又透明的自动化分割方法以支持临床决策。

Method: 改进SegNet架构（修改池化策略增强噪声OCT图像特征提取），采用交叉熵和Dice损失的混合损失函数处理薄层不平衡问题，集成Grad-CAM提供可视化解释。

Result: 验证准确率95.77%，Dice系数0.9446，Jaccard指数0.8951，在大多数视网膜层表现稳健，Grad-CAM可视化显示与解剖学相关区域一致。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合架构改进、定制损失函数和可解释AI，在准确性和可解释性之间架起桥梁，具有标准化OCT分析、提升诊断效率和增强临床信任的潜力。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Motivation: 生成式AI产生的深度伪造音频严重威胁语音生物识别应用，现有检测方法容易受到反取证攻击的影响，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 在五个深度伪造基准数据集上对SoTA音频深度伪造检测方法进行广泛评估，分为原始音频和频谱图两类方法，测试多种统计修改和优化攻击。

Result: 分析揭示了ADD方法在不同反取证攻击下的漏洞，为理解现有检测方法的局限性和优势提供了深入见解。

Conclusion: 研究不仅暴露了检测方法的脆弱性，还为设计更鲁棒的实时语音生物识别检测器提供了指导，有助于开发适应性防御策略应对不断进化的反取证技术。

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Method: 使用ESC-50数据集（2000个标注环境音频），采用端到端深度学习流程，比较梅尔频谱图、MFCC、循环节奏图、STFT色谱图、CQT色谱图和CENS色谱图等多种特征

Result: 梅尔频谱图和MFCC在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等多分类指标上表现显著优于其他特征

Conclusion: 对于基于深度CNN的音频分类任务，梅尔频谱图和MFCC是最有效的输入特征选择

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.
