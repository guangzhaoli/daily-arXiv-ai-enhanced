### [2] [AMMKD: Adaptive Multimodal Multi-teacher Distillation for Lightweight Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00039)
*Yuqi Li,Chuanguang Yang,Junhao Dong,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Zeyu Dong,Hansheng Zeng,Zhulin An,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD框架通过多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，实现了轻量高效的图像-文本检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备上部署受限，因其模型大且计算复杂。

Method: 结合多模态特征融合、多教师蒸馏和自适应优化，预训练CLIP教师模型，并设计动态权重方案。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: AMMKD有效且灵活，适用于轻量级检索任务。

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的二维可持续性评估系统，通过两个定量指标（FMS和ASC）平衡深度学习模型训练的性能与能耗，并在多模态任务中验证其普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型训练中的高碳排放问题，平衡算法性能与能源消耗。

Method: 提出可持续谐波均值（FMS）和可持续性曲线下面积（ASC）两个指标，构建性能-能耗曲线。

Result: 在多模态任务中验证了指标系统的普适性，为跨任务算法评估提供量化依据。

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

### [5] [MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00056)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态输入模态MESTI和网络MEGANet，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态难以捕捉微表情的细微动态，导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入MESTI作为输入模态，结合MEGANet的梯度注意力块提取特征。

Result: MESTI和MEGANet组合在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: MESTI和MEGANet为微表情识别提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一种生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的模型，通过离散扩散语言模型生成空间连贯的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构因内存占用和类别不平衡而困难。

Method: 将体素视为标记，使用离散扩散语言模型生成3D体素结构。

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集上生成真实且连贯的结构，即使数据稀疏度超过98%。

Conclusion: 离散扩散是3D稀疏体素生成建模的有前景框架。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SGLC的新框架，用于高分辨率图像去雾，结合全局和局部特征，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去雾模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因缺乏全局与局部特征的结合。

Method: SGLC框架包含全局特征生成器（GFG）和局部特征增强器（LFE），结合Uformer架构。

Result: 实验显示SGLC在高分辨率数据集上PSNR显著提升。

Conclusion: SGLC模型无关，可增强任何去雾网络，提升高分辨率图像的视觉保真度。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种大规模自监督异常检测模型，用于肾脏毒理学病理学，旨在降低药物安全评估的成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物临床前开发中，肾脏异常检测需要检查大量正常切片以发现细微变化，过程耗时且昂贵。

Method: 利用UNI基础模型提取特征，结合自监督方法进行异常检测。

Result: 自监督方法在特征上表现优于随机，AUC为0.62，阴性预测值为89%。

Conclusion: 该模型有望用于排除正常切片，降低药物开发成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）在标准自然图像上表现优异，但在复杂环境和变形物体场景中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入了一个专门设计的垃圾分类数据集，并提出了一种深入的评估方法。

Result: 研究发现VLLMs在复杂环境中的鲁棒性仍需进一步提升。

Conclusion: 论文强调了改进VLLMs在复杂环境中性能的重要性，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过生成视觉查询来改进文本到图像检索的方法，结合了生成模型和视觉模型，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉与语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间上存在模态差距，限制了检索性能。

Method: 采用两步法：1）用扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询；2）用视觉模型估计图像间相似性，并通过聚合网络融合多模态查询结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合生成模型和视觉模型，有效缩小了模态差距，提升了文本到图像检索的性能。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的生物特征信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但会无意中泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别等），缺乏公开的数据集或基准来评估和解决这一问题。

Method: 引入PRISM基准评估MLLMs在拒绝生物特征相关查询和避免隐含泄露方面的能力，并构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统移除生物特征信息来保护隐私。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs存在广泛的生物特征泄露问题，而基于Safe-LLaVA微调的模型显著减少了泄露。

Conclusion: PRISM和Safe-LLaVA为隐私对齐的MLLM开发和评估设立了新标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME是一种新型跨模态对齐方法，通过自我中心的世界模型增强深度学习模型在未知环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在动态、开放集任务中时空推理和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含跨模态对齐、动态认知地图和指令导航推理三个关键组件。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE上，准确率和探索效率提升1%-3%。

Conclusion: VEME通过几何感知的时空经验嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，结合超声图像和临床数据，提高叶状肿瘤的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶状肿瘤在术前难以分类，常导致不必要的手术切除，需提高诊断准确性。

Method: 开发了双分支神经网络，融合超声图像和患者元数据，采用类感知采样和分层交叉验证。

Result: 多模态方法优于单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18表现最佳，AUC-ROC分别为0.9427和0.9349。

Conclusion: 多模态AI可作为非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要活检，改善临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FHT2SP的快速且高精度的Hough变换算法，结合了Brady的超像素概念，实现了接近最优的计算复杂度和恒定误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的快速Hough变换算法（如FHT2DT）在计算效率上表现良好，但精度随图像尺寸增大而降低；而高精度算法则计算成本过高。因此，需要一种兼具高效和高精度的算法。

Method: FHT2SP算法扩展了Brady的超像素概念，将其应用于任意形状的图像，并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中。通过选择合适的超像素尺寸，实现了接近最优的计算复杂度和恒定误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，FHT2SP算法在计算复杂度上接近最优（O(wh ln³ w)），且误差独立于图像尺寸，可通过参数控制。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法在计算效率和精度之间取得了平衡，为Hough变换的应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal

*Liang Gong,Tommy,Wang,Sara Chaker,Yanchen Dong,Fouad Bousetouane,Brenden Morton,Mark Mendez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言引导的生成视觉系统，用于制造业中的残余轮廓检测，旨在实现CAD级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异和不受控成像条件限制，传统边缘检测和手工流程效果有限。

Method: 系统分为三阶段：数据采集与预处理、条件GAN生成轮廓、通过视觉语言建模进行多模态轮廓细化。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提高了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手动追踪。GPT-image-1在标准化条件下表现优于Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 研究表明，VLM引导的生成工作流有望突破传统流程限制，推动工业计算机视觉发展。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言感知信息最大化（LIMO）损失方法，用于改进基于CLIP的转导式少样本学习，通过结合互信息、KL散度和交叉熵损失，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前转导式少样本学习在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中的应用尚处于早期阶段，且缺乏针对VLMs的定制方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出LIMO损失，结合了视觉输入与文本类描述之间的互信息、KL散度惩罚和标准交叉熵损失，并探索了参数高效微调（PEFT）策略。

Result: LIMO在转导式少样本CLIP方法中表现优异，大幅超越现有方法，并在归纳方法中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LIMO展示了在转导式少样本学习中调整模型参数的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

TL;DR: MorphGen通过整合组织病理学图像、增强和核分割掩码，在监督对比学习框架中学习对领域变化具有鲁棒性的癌症表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学中的领域泛化受限于不同机构间组织制备、染色和成像条件的异质性，而病理学家依赖领域不变的形态学特征进行诊断。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，通过对齐图像和核掩码的潜在表征，优先考虑核和形态学异型性等诊断特征，并结合随机权重平均（SWA）增强鲁棒性。

Result: MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类，并展示了对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MorphGen不仅实现了领域外泛化，还解决了数字病理学中深度学习系统的关键脆弱性。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种视觉令牌剪枝策略，通过互信息最大化保留跨模态对齐和模态内多样性，显著减少计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理视觉和文本令牌时计算和内存成本高，现有剪枝方法效率低且冗余。

Method: 分析视觉和文本令牌的冗余差异，提出基于互信息的视觉令牌剪枝策略，并通过贪婪算法最大化嵌入空间中的成对距离。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上，令牌减少88.9%，推理速度提升56.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为多模态模型的轻量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注融合性能提升，忽视了实时融合设备的适用性。

Method: 设计了低阶近似编码和高层联合上下文场景编码的查找表结构，并提出高效的LUT蒸馏策略。

Result: 方法效率极高，耗时仅为当前轻量级SOTA算法的十分之一，且在低功耗移动设备上表现优异。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的优越性、可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在单域泛化（SDG）中通常忽略目标部署环境的文本描述资源，导致模型在分布变化下表现不佳。

Method: 提出了STAR方法，包括目标锚定子空间、谱投影和视觉语言蒸馏，以及特征空间Mixup技术。

Result: 在多个图像分类和物体检测基准测试中，STAR表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用文本元数据可以显著增强模型在数据受限情况下的泛化能力，为在未见数据的目标环境中部署鲁棒模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）去噪是后续任务的关键预处理步骤，但如何有效利用其低秩特性并保留图像细节仍具挑战性。

Method: ILRNet通过将秩最小化模块（RMM）嵌入U-Net架构，在特征域中利用小波变换和奇异值阈值处理低秩特性，并通过迭代细化过程逐步增强去噪效果。

Result: 实验表明，ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ILRNet通过结合模型驱动和数据驱动方法，有效解决了HSI去噪问题，并在细节保留和性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM在多功能手术视频理解中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示，性能不佳且可能损害视觉基础性能，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: SPO-VLM分为两阶段：第一阶段计算自适应层特定转向向量；第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化细化转向向量。

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM在增强安全性的同时保持了良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过两阶段结构平衡效率与效果，为VLM防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NoiseCutMix的新数据增强方法，结合了CutMix和扩散模型的优势，生成自然且高分辨率的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如CutMix在结合多类图像时会产生不自然的边界，因此需要一种更自然的数据增强方法。

Method: 通过部分结合扩散模型中两个不同类别的估计噪声，实现自然且高分辨率的图像生成。

Result: 在分类实验中验证了NoiseCutMix的有效性，优于传统方法和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix是一种有效的多类数据增强方法，能够生成自然的图像。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

TL;DR: 提出两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法（UDAKD和FSKD），利用2D图像模型辅助3D LiDAR点云分割，减少对3D标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量标注的3D点云数据，成本高且耗时；而2D图像数据更易获取且规模大。

Method: 通过跨模态知识蒸馏，利用2D-3D对应关系，将2D网络输出与3D网络对齐，无需3D标注。使用自校准卷积处理3D点云。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，性能优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著减少了对3D标注的需求，同时提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Motivation: 叙事分析中，研究人员和参与者需要处理大量文本数据，负担沉重。论文旨在提出一种更高效、友好的叙事制作和表示方法。

Method: 提出了NAME范式，开发了角色定位和形状模块以生成合理图像，并设计了一套评估指标来衡量生成角色的感知质量和叙事一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NAME在少量数据下显著降低了FID分数（如从195降至152），并在新指标上优于基线（3.62 vs. 2.66）。

Conclusion: NAME通过图像化叙事分析，显著提升了效率和质量，为叙事研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁的视角变化和部分遮挡导致现有方法难以准确定位对象，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出分层注意力引导（TAG）和增强训练（EgoACT），结合类令牌和主成分得分图优化定位，并通过数据增强提升多样性。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上显著优于基线方法，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL通过分层和增强策略有效解决了自我中心视频中的对象定位挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

### [34] [Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395)
*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双约束扩散模型（DCDM），用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，显著减少可训练参数数量，提高重建灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建可减少患者辐射暴露和检查时间，但可能导致噪声增加和图像细节减少，影响图像质量。

Method: DCDM包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束（NTC）和编码连接约束（ENC）。NTC利用核范数近似矩阵秩最小化，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中，从低剂量图像中提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示。ENC利用这些特征表示编码和控制预训练扩散模型，最终在像素空间获得重建PET图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子（DRF）上优于现有方法，并能很好地推广到未知DRF场景，甚至在1%全剂量的超低剂量下仍表现优异。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，提高了重建灵活性，适用于不同剂量水平的PET重建，且在超低剂量下仍能保持高质量图像重建。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对全景视频修复的深度学习模型DAOVI，解决了传统方法在处理全景视频时的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频的广视角常导致不需要的物体出现，现有方法未解决其投影失真问题。

Method: DAOVI引入考虑测地距离的模块和深度感知特征传播模块，处理几何失真。

Result: 实验表明，DAOVI在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI有效解决了全景视频修复中的失真问题，提升了修复效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，验证了所提策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过额外监督信号和增强策略，显著提升了人体化身的重建质量。

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可显著加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层减少编码阶段的令牌和压缩解码阶段的KV缓存来提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在推理过程中效率较低，尤其是在处理长序列时，需要一种无需额外训练即可加速的方法。

Method: LightVLM将推理分为编码和解码两阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔令牌合并减少令牌数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩减少延迟。

Result: 实验显示，LightVLM在保留35%图像令牌时性能不变，3%时仍保持98%性能，网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率，使其在生成长序列时速度更快，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Motivation: 现有方法（如注意力机制和Transformer）在计算病理学中要么忽略上下文关系，要么计算成本高且易过拟合。状态空间模型虽计算效率高，但打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。

Method: 提出SemaMIL，通过语义重排序（SR）聚类和排列语义相似的补丁，并结合语义引导检索状态空间模块（SRSM）优化全局建模。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上，SemaMIL以更少的计算量和参数实现了最先进的准确率。

Conclusion: SemaMIL在保持高效计算的同时，显著提升了多实例学习在计算病理学中的性能。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Result: 在五个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证了EOIR的有效性，实现了更优的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。

Conclusion: EOIR在保持精度的同时提供了更高的效率和平滑度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench是一个全面的视频多模态奖励模型（MRM）评估基准，覆盖感知、知识、推理和安全四个维度，包含1,563个高质量标注样本，评估了28种MRM模型，揭示了关键发现。

Motivation: 现有视频领域的MRM评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，亟需一个更全面的基准来推动MRM的发展。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建了1,563个高质量标注样本，涵盖1,482个独特视频和1,559个问题，并对28种MRM模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o的总体准确率仅为57.0%，开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究发现RL训练的MRM不一定具有更强的跨模态泛化能力，且输入视频帧数对不同类型MRM有不同影响。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域的MRM评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时空交错视频哈希（STVH）技术，用于解决复杂场景下视频数据中群体活动的快速检索问题，并进一步提出了多焦点版本（M-STVH）以同时关注活动语义和对象视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频数据在复杂场景中的爆炸性增长，快速检索群体活动成为一个紧迫问题，现有方法无法在活动粒度上进行检索。

Method: 通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉时空演化特征；M-STVH通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，STVH和M-STVH均能取得优异结果。

Conclusion: STVH和M-STVH技术有效解决了群体活动检索问题，并在多焦点需求场景下表现出色。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST是一种基于令牌驱动的双流框架，用于解决超声图像风格差异问题，通过选择合适的目标令牌和优化下游任务性能，显著提升了图像翻译质量和下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声图像风格差异导致下游任务性能下降，现有UI2I方法未明确过滤相关风格特征，可能导致翻译图像与下游任务需求不匹配。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，包含令牌驱动模块（TR）从数据和模型视角选择目标令牌，并通过行为镜像损失优化，同时在源编码器中注入辅助提示以匹配下游任务需求。

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能上均优于现有UI2I方法。

Conclusion: TRUST通过保留源内容并转移目标域共同风格，有效解决了风格差异问题，提升了图像翻译和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Black-Box Distillation (B2D)方法，通过ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC)动态选择最优尺度，解决了黑盒模型训练本地模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIaaS的普及使得预训练模型通过API被广泛使用，但黑盒模型的权重、训练数据和logits不可访问，导致现有领域适应方法不适用。

Method: 提出B2D设置，利用DINOv2注意力图动态选择最优尺度，通过熵评分识别信息丰富的尺度进行伪标签蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，ATGC在仅使用one-hot API预测的情况下，在多个数据集上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: ATGC有效解决了黑盒模型训练本地模型的问题，为AIaaS环境下的模型适应提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言引导的解缠框架（LBD），用于解决类增量语义分割中的语义纠缠问题，通过预训练视觉语言模型的先验语义指导特征解缠，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量语义分割（CISS）中，现有方法在增量过程中因语义错位和动态数据演化导致原型-特征纠缠和背景-增量纠缠，引入噪声和错误。

Method: 提出LBD框架，利用预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的先验语义，通过语言引导的原型解缠和流形互背景解缠，实现特征自主解缠。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k数据集上，特别是在多步场景中，取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，并通过软提示调整和编码器适应进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一种模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，用于人脑成像，通过创新的训练策略解决了未校准模态（如MRI）的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型方法在未校准模态（如MRI）中泛化能力不足，限制了其在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出“轻度到重度”的受试者内生成和“真实-合成”混合训练策略，使模型对图像外观变化具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上验证了BrainFM在五种基础脑成像任务中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BrainFM是一种通用且强大的脑成像基础模型，适用于多种任务和输入模态。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)的方法，通过跨注意力机制整合全局场景上下文与局部特征，显著提升了细粒度目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有挑战性的视觉领域（如车辆损伤评估）中，细粒度目标检测对专家来说也颇具难度。尽管DiffusionDet通过条件去噪扩散取得了进展，但其性能仍受限于局部特征条件化。

Method: CAF利用跨注意力机制，通过一个独立的编码器捕获全局场景上下文，并将其与局部提案特征直接整合，使每个对象提案能够关注全面的环境信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在CarDD基准测试中优于现有技术，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测设立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: CAF框架通过整合全局上下文信息，显著提升了生成式检测范式的性能，为细粒度目标检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自然图像领域表现良好，但在遥感图像分割中因类别多样性和领域差距而受限。

Method: 通过全局-局部解耦模块（GLD）和上下文感知裁剪策略，实现视觉与文本特征在局部和全局层面的对齐，支持开放词汇语义分割和参考表达分割。

Result: DGL-RSIS框架在无需训练的情况下，实现了遥感图像中准确且可解释的视觉语言对齐。

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS为遥感图像分割提供了一种高效且无需训练的方法，解决了领域差距和类别多样性问题。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，需及时检测以应对气候变化。传统方法依赖预处理步骤，新方法旨在简化流程并提高效率。

Method: 使用未正交校正数据（UnorthoDOS）训练ML模型，与传统正交校正数据方法对比，并评估性能。

Result: ML模型在未正交校正数据上表现与传统方法相当，正交校正数据训练的模型优于基线（mag1c）。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了甲烷检测流程，性能不逊于传统方法，为快速响应系统提供了支持。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，AP25和PCP指标显著提升。

Conclusion: MV-SSM在多视图3D姿态估计中具有强泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

Motivation: MLLMs在复杂语义理解上表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基本视觉任务中表现不佳，主要原因是单一视觉编码器的设计牺牲了细粒度信息捕捉能力。

Method: 提出FtZ框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，将语义强大的锚编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器结合。

Conclusion: 异构专家编码器的组合是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的有效途径，为下一代AI系统设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计缺乏可靠的真实数据，现有方法依赖合成数据或自监督学习，存在域差距或违反光度假设。

Method: 引入STM策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知方向进行初始化，并施加主方向正则化。

Result: 在四种真实天气条件下的基准测试中，STM优于现有PEFT方法、全微调方法，甚至超越基于合成数据训练的深度基础模型。

Conclusion: STM在保持预训练模型泛化能力的同时，实现了灵活的天气通用深度估计，为几何中心任务提供了新的PEFT解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

TL;DR: LLaVA-Critic-R1挑战传统，将批评模型直接用于生成任务，通过强化学习优化生成模型，同时在批评和生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言建模中，批评模型仅用于评估输出，而非生成响应。本研究挑战这一惯例，探索批评模型在生成任务中的潜力。

Method: 将偏好标记的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，对基础生成模型进行强化学习，训练出LLaVA-Critic-R1。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1在26个视觉推理和理解基准中表现优异，平均提升5.7%，并进一步扩展为LLaVA-Critic-R1+，在MMMU上达到71.9的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，批评模型的强化学习可以产生统一模型，在评估和生成任务中均表现出色，为多模态系统的自我改进提供了简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,

*Qingyu Wang,Xue Jiang,Guozheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的跨状态融合网络（CSFMamba），用于遥感图像分类，结合CNN和Mamba的优势，降低计算负担并提升特征融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）在建模长距离依赖时计算复杂度高，Mamba虽能降低计算负担，但无法直接进行特征融合。

Method: 设计了预处理模块和跨状态模块，结合CNN提取多层特征，利用Mamba算子实现多模态特征融合。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018数据集上，该方法在降低训练负担的同时，性能优于Transformer。

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络有效结合了Mamba的低计算负担和CNN的特征提取能力，提升了多模态遥感图像分类性能。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨架数据的时空结构特性，传统方法主要依赖图卷积网络（GCNs），但Transformer和掩码预训练框架为表示学习提供了新思路。

Method: 提出CascadeFormer，包含掩码预训练阶段学习通用骨架表示，以及级联微调阶段优化动作分类。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（Penn Action、N-UCLA和NTU RGB+D 60）上取得了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: CascadeFormer为骨架动作识别提供了新方法，并开源代码和模型以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

### [60] [Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00700)
*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估视觉语言模型（VLM）投影层泛化能力的基准，发现其在未见类别上保留了79%至88%的性能，并揭示了投影层的工作机制类似于键值记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管投影层在VLM架构中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未被系统评估。

Method: 通过将目标检测数据集转化为提示格式，并设计训练/测试集以分离可见和未见概念，构建了一个评估投影层泛化的基准。

Result: 实验表明，投影层在未见类别上保留了79%至88%的性能，且其工作机制类似于键值记忆。

Conclusion: 该研究为对齐泛化提供了新的评估框架，并展示了在有限对齐数据下高效训练VLM的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征图偏度的公平性算法，用于减少皮肤病变分类中的肤色偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤病变分类中取得了显著进展，但肤色偏见可能影响诊断结果，公平性难以保证。

Method: 通过计算VGG网络和Vision Transformer的特征图偏度，减少与肤色相关的冗余通道，专注于病变区域。

Result: 该方法降低了计算成本，减少了偏见，且不依赖传统统计方法，同时可能减小模型大小。

Conclusion: 该算法在保持公平性的同时更具实用性，适用于实际医疗应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### [62] [Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749)
*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过因果特征解释揭示视觉SAE特征的真实含义，避免仅依赖激活位置的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过最高激活的patch解释SAE特征，但自注意力机制导致激活patch可能并非因果驱动因素。

Method: 提出CaFE方法，利用有效感受野（ERF）和输入归因方法，识别因果驱动特征激活的patch。

Result: CaFE比传统方法更准确地恢复或抑制特征激活，揭示隐藏的上下文依赖关系。

Conclusion: CaFE提供更忠实和语义精确的特征解释，强调仅依赖激活位置的潜在风险。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多阶段检索框架，结合了密集文章检索、事件感知语言模型重排序和高效图像收集，用于解决基于自由描述的事件图像检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言检索方法在处理抽象事件、隐含因果关系或复杂叙述时表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段检索框架，结合Qwen3进行文章搜索、Qwen3-Reranker进行上下文对齐、Qwen2-VL进行图像评分，并使用RRF融合多配置输出。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的Track 2私有测试集上取得了top-1成绩。

Conclusion: 结合语言推理和多模态检索的方法在复杂图像理解任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法难以捕捉跨模态语义，且医疗数据有限，需要一种高效的多任务框架来提升临床环境中的多模态理解能力。

Method: 采用CLIP ViT-B/16主干网络，结合低秩适应、多级CLS令牌聚合和球形特征插值，并引入类别特定的自然语言提示进行联合训练。

Result: 在ACM MM'25挑战中，分类准确率和F1-score达95%，图像和文本检索的Recall@1分别为0.93和0.92，MRR分数为0.97和0.96。

Conclusion: 该框架在低资源临床环境中表现出色，通过多组件协同提升了多模态医疗理解的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的普及增加了版权保护的需求，现有方法依赖昂贵的微调，效率低下。

Method: 引入GaussianBridge将非结构化3D高斯转换为Splatter Image格式，支持直接神经处理嵌入任意消息；设计了Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual热图预测策略保证视觉质量；开发了基于密集分割的提取机制确保鲁棒性。

Result: 实现了高效的水印嵌入和提取，即使水印对象在渲染视图中占据极小区域也能可靠恢复消息。

Conclusion: 该框架为3DGS模型提供了高效、通用的版权保护解决方案。

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决检测变换器在人类-物体交互（HOI）检测中的“有毒兄弟”偏差的方法，通过两种新的去偏学习目标显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现“有毒兄弟”偏差会干扰交互解码器的学习，导致相似但不同的HOI三元组在输入和输出端相互竞争，降低精度。

Method: 提出了两种去偏学习目标：“对比后校准”和“合并后拆分”，分别针对输入和输出视角。前者通过位置先验重构错误三元组，后者学习共享特征并细化组内差异。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上显著优于基线（+9.18% mAP）和现有最佳方法（+3.59% mAP）。

Conclusion: 通过解决“有毒兄弟”偏差，论文提出的方法有效提升了HOI检测的精度和性能。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Motivation: 现有运动捕捉数据局限于单人操作有限物体，缺乏大规模多样化人机交互数据集。

Method: 提出自动运动提取流程，从视频中收集3D人类运动和文本描述，构建InterPose数据集。

Result: InterPose包含73.8K序列，显著提升了现有方法的性能，并开发了基于LLM的零样本动画代理。

Conclusion: InterPose填补了人机交互数据集的空白，为复杂场景中的运动生成提供了新工具。

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的安全人脸检索框架，解决了传统同态加密效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸检索系统通常外包给第三方，存在隐私风险，而同态加密效率不足。

Method: 采用可取消乘积量化（Cancelable PQ）的两阶段框架，包括高效索引模块和细粒度密文检索模块。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法在效果、效率和安全性之间的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全人脸检索提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成生物学上合理的脑信号，为视觉假体的脑编码阶段提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景理解，忽略了真实驾驶场景中的时间维度，限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 提出OmniReason-Data数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，结合稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，通过时空知识蒸馏捕获时空因果推理模式。

Result: 在开环规划任务和视觉问答基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架为复杂动态环境中的自动驾驶提供了可解释且时间感知的新能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次检索框架在知识密集型视觉问答中难以获取足够的外部知识，限制了MLLMs的表现。

Method: MI-RAG通过迭代推理记录动态生成多查询，跨模态检索视觉和文本知识，并逐步更新推理记录。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确性。

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答提供了一种可扩展的组合推理方法。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited

particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应对比度调整模块（ACAM），用于提升胎儿超声标准平面分类的准确性，通过多视角融合和内容感知适应能力显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿超声标准平面分类在可靠产前诊断中至关重要，但面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性等挑战。

Method: 设计了一个浅层纹理敏感网络，预测临床可行的对比度参数，并通过可微分映射生成多视角增强图像，融合到下游分类器中。

Result: 在多中心数据集上验证，轻量级模型准确率提升2.02%，传统模型提升1.29%，先进模型提升1.15%。

Conclusion: ACAM通过内容感知适应能力和多视角融合，有效提升了模型对图像质量变化的鲁棒性，为医学图像分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度的对抗攻击方法SDM，通过重构优化目标并引入三层优化框架，显著提升了攻击性能和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性需要高效的对抗攻击方法。

Method: 重构优化目标为最大化非真实标签概率上界与真实标签概率的差异，提出SDM方法，采用三层优化框架（循环-阶段-步骤），并引入DPDR损失函数。

Result: SDM在攻击性能和成本效益上优于现有SOTA方法，并能结合对抗训练提升防御效果。

Conclusion: SDM是一种高效且成本效益高的对抗攻击方法，适用于模型鲁棒性评估和防御增强。

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Gabor滤波器和模糊U-Net-ViT模型的新方法，用于提高纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂纹理和噪声环境下检测缺陷时表现不佳，需要一种结合局部和全局特征的方法。

Method: 结合U-Net的局部特征训练和ViT的全局处理能力，使用高斯滤波损失函数和SP掩码增强训练，后处理中应用Gabor滤波器。

Result: 在多个数据集上平均AUC达到0.939，消融实验验证了滤波器尺寸和噪声概率对性能的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂纹理和噪声环境下表现出色，为表面缺陷检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景重建在AR/VR等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法因运动模糊导致位姿估计误差累积，影响重建效果。

Method: 将相机和物体运动建模为3D高斯的SE(3)仿射变换，提出三阶段训练策略，交替优化位姿和高斯属性。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实场景中，方法在重建质量和位姿估计上优于现有动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 统一优化框架有效解决了运动模糊导致的位姿误差问题，提升了动态场景重建的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Motivation: 现有的分割方法通常依赖复杂的解码器或多尺度融合，导致参数和计算成本高。SegDINO旨在通过轻量级设计解决这一问题。

Method: SegDINO从预训练的DINOv3编码器中提取多级特征，对齐分辨率和通道宽度，并使用轻量级MLP头直接预测分割掩码。

Conclusion: SegDINO通过轻量级设计有效减少了参数和计算成本，同时保持了高性能，为分割任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Motivation: 大气干扰和雾霾显著降低卫星图像的清晰度，影响信息提取的准确性。

Method: 采用SwinRRDB模块结合全局和局部特征学习，并引入复合损失函数（L2损失、引导损失和分水岭损失）。

Result: 在RICE和SateHaze1K数据集上表现优异，PSNR达33.24 dB，SSIM为0.967。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减轻了卫星图像中的大气干扰，具有广泛的遥感应用潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单图像新视角合成中难以保持长距离或闭环轨迹的一致性和正确对齐，因此需要一种新方法来确保全局一致性。

Method: 通过分解任务为360度场景外推和视角插值，利用全景扩散模型学习场景先验，并通过预训练的视频扩散模型生成一致的新视角。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成一致视图的效果优于现有方法，尤其在闭环场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解任务和利用扩散模型，显著提升了新视角合成的全局一致性和灵活性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前量化感知训练（QAT）方法主要关注提升量化模型在分布内（I.D）数据上的性能，而忽视了在分布外（OOD）数据上的性能下降问题。本文通过实验验证了QAT会导致OOD泛化性能显著下降，并提出了一种面向平坦性的QAT方法FQAT，通过层冻结机制和自适应算法解决梯度冲突和层间干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法在OOD数据上的性能下降问题未被充分研究，本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出FQAT方法，包括层冻结机制和基于梯度紊乱度量的自适应冻结算法，以优化QAT的平坦性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明FQAT在I.D和OOD任务上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FQAT通过平坦性优化有效提升了量化模型的OOD泛化性能，为QAT研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI筛查方法依赖轮廓数据，忽略了临床相关的姿态不对称性，而姿态数据虽直观但缺乏大规模标注数据集且易受噪声影响。

Method: 提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双表征框架（DRF），结合连续骨架图和离散姿态不对称向量（PAV），并引入PAV引导注意力模块（PGA）。

Result: DRF在实验中表现优异，可视化验证了模型能有效利用临床不对称性线索。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双表征和临床先验提升了脊柱侧弯筛查的准确性和可解释性，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Motivation: CLIP的成功表明提示调优可以实现跨模态语义对齐，但冗余或弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加计算成本。

Method: Spotlighter从样本和语义角度评估每个视觉token的激活，保留高分token用于下游预测，并通过语义记忆库和两级排名机制优化选择。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升11.19%，并实现额外0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter是一种高效且可扩展的提示调优基线方法。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Result: 在AIM 2025挑战赛中取得第一名，并在基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DarkVRAI为低光视频去噪设定了新标准。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Motivation: 现有固定压缩比的策略忽略了视频片段语义密度的差异，导致信息丰富的片段表示不足或静态片段计算冗余。

Method: 利用轻量级语言模型生成软描述令牌，基于语义密度感知监督动态调整压缩比。

Result: 实验显示FLOPs减少49%，性能保持竞争力，并能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比。

Conclusion: LangDC有效平衡了计算效率和视频理解性能，模拟了人类动态描述视觉信息的方式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Motivation: 3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但在多光谱数据上的简单优化会导致重建效果不佳，因为几何结构在不同光谱下表现不一致。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1) 独立优化各波段；2) 先优化RGB几何结构，再复制并优化其他波段；3) 联合优化所有波段。

Conclusion: 建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色分量中，并揭示了优化过程中引入光谱波段的关键权衡。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 雨天驾驶增加了事故风险，了解驾驶员在雨天如何调整视觉行为对设计驾驶员监控系统和辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 通过两步聚类方法分析眼动数据，结合马尔可夫转移矩阵和注视时间、视线高度等指标，比较晴天和雨天条件下的驾驶行为。

Result: 雨天驾驶时，驾驶员更频繁地查看仪表盘，注视时间更长，视线高度更高，表明认知负荷增加。

Conclusion: 研究结果为恶劣天气下的视觉注意力模式提供了重要见解，有助于设计更强大的驾驶员辅助系统。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral
species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their
success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5
frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large
collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this
area.

*Zixin Zhu,Kevin Duarte,Mamshad Nayeem Rizve,Chengyuan Xu,Ratheesh Kalarot,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSlider 是一种基于滑块的文本到图像生成方法，通过解耦多个属性并引入新的损失函数，实现了对多个属性的独立和可靠控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本到图像生成中，即使使用详细的文本提示，对属性（如年龄或微笑）的细粒度控制仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常单独训练每个属性的适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠，导致干扰。

Method: CompSlider 通过生成条件先验来控制多个属性，同时引入解耦和结构损失函数，以保持图像的结构一致性。

Result: CompSlider 在多个属性上表现出色，并能扩展到视频生成，同时减少了训练和推理的计算负担。

Conclusion: CompSlider 提供了一种高效且通用的方法，用于在文本到图像和视频生成中实现多属性的独立控制。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对玻璃污染物的图像恢复方法，通过真实配对数据和自监督辅助学习任务，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖合成数据或仅针对雨滴，难以应对现实中多种污染物（如泥水、灰尘等）的挑战。

Method: 使用真实配对图像训练，结合一次性测试时自适应机制和自监督辅助学习任务。

Result: 在定量和定性上优于现有方法，尤其对未见过的污染物效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效恢复多种污染物污染的玻璃图像，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实病理图像常因制备伪影、染色变异和成像限制而质量下降，现有方法缺乏通用性，无法应对多样化的低级别视觉挑战。

Method: 采用对比预训练编码器学习可迁移、染色不变的特征表示，结合统一的条件扩散过程，通过文本提示动态适应特定任务。

Conclusion: LPFM为病理图像的低级别增强提供了通用且高效的解决方案，显著提升了图像质量和任务适应性。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但现有CNN和Transformer模型分别存在感受野有限和计算成本高的问题。Mamba因其线性复杂度处理长序列的能力成为有潜力的替代方案。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块（HSFA）分离学习高低频特征，以及视觉状态空间模块（VSSM）和Hilbert曲线扫描技术，优化Mamba框架。

Result: 实验表明，SpectMamba在多种医学图像检测任务中达到最先进性能，兼具高效性和准确性。

Conclusion: SpectMamba通过结合频率和空间特征，有效解决了医学图像检测中的全局上下文捕捉和计算效率问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向稀疏注意力（BSA）框架，显著提升了视频DiT模型的训练和推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频DiT模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算瓶颈，尤其是高分辨率和长视频场景。全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高。

Method: 通过动态稀疏化查询（Query）和键值对（Key-Value），优化计算效率。具体包括基于语义相似度的查询稀疏化和动态统计阈值保留关键KV块。

Result: BSA显著加速了DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，且生成质量不降反升。

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算瓶颈，为高效生成高质量视频提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE是一种端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，显著提升了姿态估计的准确性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频姿态估计方法中时空维度分离、依赖复杂后处理以及推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个时空Transformer组件（STPE、STDME、STPD）和实例一致性机制。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上表现优于多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升300%。

Conclusion: VEPE通过端到端设计和时空上下文利用，实现了高效且准确的视频姿态估计。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Result: 在基准数据集上，PVINet表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理和特征交互，显著提升了点云重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的频率启发的上下文解耦生成（FICGen）范式，用于解决在退化场景中布局到图像生成的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在退化场景中，布局到图像生成存在生成保真度低和与用户提供布局对齐性差的问题，主要归因于“上下文幻觉困境”。

Method: FICGen通过双查询机制和频率重采样器提取上下文频率原型，并利用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率知识转移和上下文解耦，有效提升了退化场景中的布局到图像生成性能。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，难以灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的图像区域，限制了特征表示的效果。

Method: GPSToken利用2D高斯参数化动态建模图像区域的位置和形状，结合纹理特征，并通过熵驱动算法分区图像，使用专用Transformer优化高斯参数。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过解耦空间布局和纹理特征，实现了高效的两阶段生成，并在性能上达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，而忽略了标记数据中的潜在噪声和未标记像素的异质性价值。MetaSSL旨在通过挖掘损失函数中的丰富信息来提升学习效果。

Method: MetaSSL通过将未标记数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），并为每个区域分配不同的权重，设计了一种空间异质性损失函数。该方法还通过自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并将异质性损失应用于标记图像以应对标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，MetaSSL与现有半监督学习方法结合后，在不同数据集上显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一种即插即用的通用框架，能够有效提升半监督学习在医学图像分割中的性能，同时应对标注噪声和未标记数据的异质性。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Result: 实验表明MVTrajecter优于现有方法，验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过多时间戳信息和注意力机制，显著提升了多视角行人跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 发现这些编码器在识别关键帧方面能力有限，影响模型对文本查询的处理。

Conclusion: 开发更好的关键帧识别技术可能是提升视频多模态大语言模型效率的必要步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind框架通过联合建模神经动态和语义特征，显著提升了从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的准确性和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决动态一致性和复杂语义上下文方面存在不足，主要受限于EEG的低空间分辨率、神经记录与视频动态的时间不匹配以及语义信息利用不足。

Method: DynaMind包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器（RSM）、时间感知动态对齐器（TDA）和双引导视频重建器（DGVR），分别负责提取多模态语义特征、生成动态潜在序列以保持时间一致性，以及最终重建高保真视频。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上，DynaMind在视频和帧级别准确率分别提升了12.5和10.3个百分点，像素级质量显著提高（SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%）。

Conclusion: DynaMind在神经动态与高保真视觉语义之间架起了桥梁，标志着该领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化图像生成中，保持主体保真度和避免跨主体属性泄漏是主要挑战。

Method: 提出FocusDPO框架，基于动态语义对应和图像复杂度自适应识别焦点区域，并在训练中逐步调整焦点区域。

Result: 在单主体和多主体个性化图像合成基准测试中取得最优结果，有效减少属性泄漏并保持主体保真度。

Conclusion: FocusDPO推动了可控多主体图像合成的前沿发展。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SegAssess的新型深度学习框架，通过全景质量映射（PQM）实现像素级的无监督分割质量评估（SQA），解决了现有方法在评估粒度、完整性和可迁移性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的无监督SQA方法存在评估粒度粗、评估不完整和可迁移性差的问题，亟需一种更全面的解决方案。

Method: SegAssess将SQA任务重新定义为四类全景分割问题，利用改进的Segment Anything Model（SAM）架构，通过交叉注意力整合输入掩码作为提示，并引入边缘引导压缩（EGC）分支和增强混合采样（AMS）训练策略。

Result: 在32个数据集上的实验表明，SegAssess实现了最先进的性能，并展现出卓越的零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM提供了一种稳健且可迁移的无监督SQA解决方案，显著提升了分割质量评估的全面性和跨域适用性。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Motivation: 解决森林监测中缺乏高分辨率树高预测模型训练数据的问题。

Method: 提出一个编码器-解码器框架，利用多时相多光谱图像和时间差异预测树高。

Result: U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上表现最佳，误差为11.78%，优于ResNet-50和仅用RGB的实验。

Conclusion: PrediTree数据集和提出的框架为树高预测提供了有效工具，数据和处理代码已公开。

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing

Motivation: 解决多3D形状间的点对对应问题，现有方法仅从单一形状学习嵌入，缺乏对形状集合整体流形结构的捕捉。

Method: 利用形状图注意力网络捕捉形状集合的流形结构，构建共享潜在空间，并通过空间和谱域表示对应关系，引入循环一致性损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了更一致和准确的形状对应。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过共享潜在空间和多级一致性，显著提升了非刚性多形状匹配的性能。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Result: 实验结果表明，使用新数据预训练可以提升开放词汇SGG模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 新指标和数据生成方法为开放词汇SGG提供了更公平的评估和更高效的训练途径。

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Motivation: 当前方法在连续切片中存在空间错位问题，严重影响病理学原位解释，需要更准确的虚拟染色模式。

Method: PRINTER结合原型驱动的染色模式转移、循环注册-合成框架GapBridge以及变形感知对抗学习策略，实现H&E和IHC染色模式的精确对齐。

Result: 实验表明PRINTER在保留H&E染色细节和虚拟染色保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRINTER为虚拟染色提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学的发展。

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Motivation: 高质量标注数据对训练准确文档转换模型至关重要，但手动标注成本高且耗时，现有自动标注模型在复杂场景下准确性不足。

Method: 第一阶段生成大规模多样化合成数据，第二阶段通过自改进方法将模型从合成数据适应到真实文档，通过迭代提升模型和数据质量。

Result: 训练的POINTS-Reader模型超越了许多现有公开和专有模型，性能优越。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了文档转换模型的性能和数据质量，适用于多样化文档格式。

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过闭环反馈和多智能体协作，有效提升了HSI的性能和真实性。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 双视角交叉重建范式显著提升了点云自监督学习的难度和效果，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

Result: 在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的OpenEvents V1数据集上，ReCap以0.54666的总分排名第二，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: ReCap成功地将视觉感知与现实世界知识结合，为高要求领域的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Result: 在大规模SARDet-100K数据集上的实验结果表明，优化后的模型优于现有SAR检测方法，实现了更高的检测精度和更低的计算开销。

Conclusion: 本文为利用NAS解决实际问题提供了新视角，展示了NAS在SAR目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达传感器在恶劣光照和天气条件下比摄像头更鲁棒，但现有雷达目标检测模型效率不足。

Method: 采用多表示输入（热图和灰度图），设计适配器分支、交换模块和主辅助融合模块，结合神经架构搜索优化模型。

Conclusion: 模型在精度和效率上取得平衡，为雷达目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的跨域少样本分割方法FSS-TIs，通过优化ODE参数探索域无关特征表示空间，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域少样本分割方法通常设计多个独立模块，但这些模块的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 提出FSS-TIs方法，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的频谱之间存在ODE关系，通过迭代变换和随机扰动优化ODE参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，FSS-TIs在跨域少样本分割任务中优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换实现了结构简洁且高效的跨域少样本分割，具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化LiDAR超分辨率和语义分割的端到端框架，显著降低了高分辨率LiDAR的成本需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本高昂，限制了大规模部署；低分辨率LiDAR（如16通道）产生的稀疏点云降低了分割精度。

Method: 采用联合优化的端到端框架，结合语义线索的超分辨率模块和新设计的SR损失函数，轻量级架构兼容分割网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分割性能上接近使用高成本64通道LiDAR数据的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法以低成本实现了高分辨率LiDAR的性能，为自动驾驶提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一种基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过学习体素级分布提高校准性和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中的模糊性需要模型能够捕捉完整的条件分布，而非单一估计。

Method: PGRD将离散标签嵌入连续空间，利用先验预测器提供逐步指导，并通过残差学习加速收敛。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD在Dice分数和NLL/ECE指标上优于其他基线模型，且采样步骤更少。

Conclusion: PGRD在医学图像分割中表现出色，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉技术在处理社交媒体和智能手机图像的地理定位时面临挑战，因此需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 利用SigLIP编码器构建向量数据库，通过检索增强生成技术结合多模态大语言模型处理查询图像。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（IM2GPS、IM2GPS3k和YFCC4k）上实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为地理定位提供了一种无需训练的新路径，展示了检索增强生成在多模态大语言模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Motivation: 传统土壤分析方法效率低，不适合实时决策，AgroSense旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0、Vision Transformer和多种机器学习模型（如XGBoost、TabNet）进行多模态数据分析。

Result: 模型准确率98%，RMSE和MAE分别为0.32和0.27，多模态耦合效果显著。

Conclusion: AgroSense为精准农业提供了实用、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: M3Ret提出了一种统一的视觉编码器，用于多模态医学图像检索，无需特定模态定制，并在零样本检索任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法因针对不同模态使用独立架构和训练策略而碎片化，限制了统一表示的发展。

Method: 利用包含2D、3D和视频数据的混合模态数据集，结合生成式（MAE）和对比式（SimDINO）自监督学习范式训练M3Ret。

Result: M3Ret在零样本图像检索任务中超越现有基线模型，并展现出对未见模态（如MRI）的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M3Ret为多模态医学图像理解的自监督学习基础模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺和调优成本高的问题，提升身份保持文本到视频生成的质量和效率。

Method: 通过Face Aware Prompt Enhancement、Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement和ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement三步优化输入和生成过程。

Result: 在自动和人工评估中表现优异，赢得ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛第一名。

Conclusion: TPIGE框架在身份保持文本到视频生成中实现了高性能和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform

three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: PRVR任务中存在查询歧义和视频部分相关性等数据不确定性问题，导致现有方法易受干扰视频影响。

Result: 实验表明，RAL在不同检索骨干网络上均有效提升了性能。

Conclusion: RAL为PRVR任务提供了一种鲁棒的对齐学习解决方案，能够有效应对数据不确定性。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而坐标函数能更好地保留几何信息并支持形态学操作。

Method: 使用神经占用场预测3D点是否在肋骨内，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取肋骨的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 连续坐标基础的3D场景表示在几何操作中优于体素表示，代码将公开。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

TL;DR: NSD框架通过并行交叉注意力机制和PSRL模块，实现了图像编辑中的语义控制和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注生成内容的语义控制，忽略了风格一致性的重要性。

Method: NSD采用扩散模型，结合文本和风格信息的并行处理，并引入PSRL模块进行细粒度风格表示学习。

Result: 实验表明NSD在语义控制和风格一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: NSD为图像编辑提供了一种兼顾语义和风格一致性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the

*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO是一种轻量级、多尺度的感知度量标准，用于全参考图像质量评估（FR-IQA），通过伪MOS监督训练，无需大规模人工标注数据，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以扩展。MILO旨在通过伪MOS监督和视觉掩蔽效应，提供高效且准确的图像质量评估工具。

Method: MILO使用伪MOS监督训练，结合多种质量度量标准生成分数，并利用空间掩蔽和课程学习策略优化生成任务。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中表现优异，适用于实时应用，并在图像和潜在域中作为感知损失函数显著提升任务性能。

Conclusion: MILO不仅是一种先进的图像质量度量标准，还能作为生成流程中的实用工具，提升感知优化效率。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖率上升使得自动化卡路里追踪成为重要工具，但现有方法存在局限性，如仅提供固定卡路里输出、难以识别多种食物、图像缩放和归一化问题，以及主要关注西方饮食。

Method: 构建孟加拉街头食品数据集，改进YOLOv8模型进行分类和分割，结合机器学习回归模型进行卡路里估算。

Result: 系统在卡路里估算中表现出色，MAE为6.94，RMSE为11.03，R^2得分为96.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于现实世界中的食品卡路里计算。

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为InfoScale的信息中心框架，用于解决扩散模型在生成不同分辨率图像时的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成不同分辨率图像时性能下降，主要原因是信息量差异导致的信息转换问题。

Method: 通过三个模块解决关键问题：渐进频率补偿模块（补偿高频信息）、自适应信息聚合模块（调整信息平衡）和噪声适应模块（重新分配初始噪声信息）。

Result: 实验证明InfoScale在生成不同分辨率图像时有效。

Conclusion: InfoScale是一种即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了扩散模型在可变尺度图像生成中的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Motivation: 解决CNN感受野有限和ViT计算成本高的问题，提出一种兼顾全局上下文和计算效率的架构。

Method: 在分层卷积主干中集成轻量级SSM门控机制，动态调制特征图并选择性强调关键面部特征。

Conclusion: 验证了CNN与选择性SSM结合的潜力，为视觉理解任务提供了新的架构范式。

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉头发细节，提升重建质量。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice是一种新的点云处理方法，通过将3D点云切片为2D数据，结合Slice Interaction Network，实现了高精度和快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有体素和柱状方法在精度和速度上的不足。

Method: 将3D点云切片为2D数据，并引入Slice Interaction Network保持垂直关系。

Result: 在Waymo、nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上表现出色，速度和参数效率显著提升。

Conclusion: PointSlice在3D目标检测中实现了高精度和快速推理的平衡。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

Motivation: 快速准确的3D形状生成在机器人、AR/VR和数字内容创作中至关重要，但现有方法依赖迭代去噪或潜在解码器，效率较低。

Method: 结合TrigFlow连续噪声调度和基于Chamfer距离的几何损失，避免了昂贵的Jacobian-vector乘积，支持高效的一到两步推理。

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D是一个可扩展的3D形状生成框架，具有高效和高保真度的特点。

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: nnUNet框架虽然能自动调整大部分超参数，但忽略了网络内部超参数的优化，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过引入自适应的卷积模块，动态调整卷积核大小，并将其集成到MSA2-Net的多尺度卷积桥（MSConvBridge）和多尺度融合解码器（MSADecoder）中，以捕捉全局和局部特征。

Result: MSA2-Net在多个数据集（Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir、ISIC2017）上表现出色，Dice系数分别达到86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net通过自适应卷积模块显著提升了医学图像分割的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: V$^2$Drop是一种高效的令牌压缩方法，适用于LVLM加速，并能与高效算子结合进一步降低GPU内存使用。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Result: 在CT-RATE基准上AUROC提高了7%，并在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集上表现出意外的零样本性能。

Conclusion: Uniferum通过整合异构注释和身体分割，为3D医学成像中临床可靠、数据高效的视觉语言模型设定了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: HIFU治疗需要实时监测，但超声引导中的干扰问题影响了治疗效果和安全性。

Method: 采用VQ-VAE和潜在扩散模型，通过编码-去噪-解码流程去除超声图像中的HIFU干扰。

Result: 在体外实验中，HIFU-ILDiff的SSIM和PSNR显著优于Notch Filter，且处理速度更快。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪，提升HIFU治疗的临床精度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一种无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，通过轻量级对称双视图关联模型（STA）作为前端，显著降低复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SLAM系统对相机内参的依赖问题，使其适用于多样化的相机配置。

Method: 采用轻量级STA模型作为前端，同时估计相机位姿和局部点图；后端设计Sim(3)位姿图结合闭环检测以消除漂移。

Result: 实验表明，ViSTA-SLAM在相机跟踪和稠密3D重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM通过创新的前端和后端设计，实现了高效且通用的视觉SLAM系统。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit提出了一种统一的视频编辑框架，通过对象失真控制信号和保留模块，实现了高效、高保真的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频编辑方法需要针对不同任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型复杂且训练资源需求高。

Method: 提出O-DisCo-Edit框架，结合对象失真控制信号和“复制形式”保留模块，统一处理多种编辑任务。

Result: 实验和人工评估表明，O-DisCo-Edit在多种视频编辑任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit通过统一框架解决了视频编辑中的控制信号多样性问题，提升了编辑效率和效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务深度学习模型在导管插入手术中结合触觉和视觉感知数据的需求，现有方法依赖CNN架构，存在局限性。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器结构的Vision Transformer模型，处理双视角X射线图像序列，通过共享分割头和回归头实现多任务。

Result: 在合成X射线图像上进行了广泛实验，模型在导管分割和力估计任务上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为导管分割和力估计任务设定了新的技术标杆，展示了Transformer在医学图像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Panel-of-Peers的新框架，通过模拟同行评审系统，利用多个LVLMs的集体输出来提升模型性能，无需大量人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且质量受限；机器生成的数据质量不足；自监督数据易产生幻觉。

Method: 采用Panel-of-Peers学习框架，模拟人类协作学习，通过多个LVLMs的迭代自我改进过程生成、评估和优化输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，平均得分从48%提高到57%。

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers框架是一种可扩展的替代方案，能够有效提升模型性能，减少对人工标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型的调度器而非模型权重，实现了模型尺寸的4倍减少，同时保持全精度准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高，且后训练量化方法依赖全精度校准，限制了其应用。

Method: Q-Sched通过调整少步采样轨迹和引入JAQ损失（结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标）来实现量化。

Result: Q-Sched在FP16 4步潜在一致性模型和8步阶段一致性模型上分别实现了15.5%和16.6%的FID改进。

Conclusion: Q-Sched证明了量化和少步蒸馏在高保真生成中的互补性，并通过大规模用户研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2简化了架构和损失设计，提高了训练效率，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过简化架构和损失设计，提升训练效率，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 移除了文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式训练的标题损失。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍，内存消耗降低1.8倍，性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级、纯生成式范式对未来多模态基础模型的视觉编码器开发具有吸引力。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Result: 在岩石尺寸分类数据集上评估，相比三个基线模型，CNSCA显著提升了细粒度分类能力。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的引入显著提升了模型在自然纹理（如岩石）细粒度分类任务中的性能。

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床元数据的两阶段扩散框架，用于解决有限角度计算机断层扫描（LACT）重建中的伪影问题，显著提高了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度计算机断层扫描（LACT）在心脏成像中具有时间分辨率高和辐射剂量低的优势，但投影截断会导致严重伪影。为了解决LACT重建的病态问题，需要一种新的方法。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段通过基于变压器的扩散模型，仅依赖临床元数据生成粗略解剖先验；第二阶段结合元数据和粗略先验生成高保真图像。在采样步骤中通过ADMM模块强制物理数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，引入元数据显著提高了重建保真度，尤其在严重角度截断情况下。方法在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在提高重建质量和效率方面具有双重作用，支持将其整合到未来的元数据引导医学成像框架中。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

Conclusion: BIB和MBIB方法能够有效学习长尾数据中的表示，保留标签相关信息，显著提升了长尾视觉识别的性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制生成图像中的光照是一个复杂任务，现有方法通常依赖于大量特定领域的数据集，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中标记交互的相似性，训练一个轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，并通过Classifier Guidance将所需光照融入生成过程。

Result: 在质量和控制方面表现出最先进的性能，同时在参数和数据效率上优于其他领先方法。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了通过利用基础知识可以实际且通用地控制图像光照。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Conclusion: LGDiST的完整架构显著优于其孤立组件，上下文基因、潜在空间和邻居条件是其关键创新。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式目标检测训练在可扩展性、适应性和隐私保护方面存在不足，而联邦学习虽然具有协作性和隐私保护优势，但在实际CAV部署中面临计算需求和环境多样性的挑战。

Method: 论文采用YOLOv5、YOLOv8、YOLOv11和Deformable DETR等先进检测器，在KITTI、BDD100K和nuScenes数据集上评估检测精度、计算成本和资源使用情况。

Result: 研究分析了不同分辨率、批量大小、天气和光照条件下检测精度与计算资源之间的权衡，为CAV中FL的稳健部署提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为CAV中联邦学习目标检测的实际部署提供了系统级评估框架，强调了环境鲁棒性和资源效率的重要性。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D数据的高维性和标注稀缺性限制了深度学习模型的直接训练，传统方法在非结构化环境中表现不佳。

Method: 结合几何先验（如深度信息、表面法线）与深度学习，开发几何感知模型。

Result: 提出的方法在相机姿态估计、点云配准、深度预测和3D重建等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 几何深度学习方法在3D视觉任务中具有潜力，适用于文化遗产保护和VR/AR等应用。

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Motivation: 传统方法耗时且现代计算机视觉方法需要大量标注数据，限制了灾后快速部署。

Method: 研究提出了两种管道（VLM和VLM+LLM），通过多视角分析评估火灾损失。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Conclusion: 首次将可解释性引入地理定位，提升了模型性能和决策透明度。

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在定量指标和感知质量上均表现出竞争力，验证了高斯泼溅在2D图像处理中的新应用方向。

Conclusion: 本文展示了高斯泼溅技术在图像修复中的潜力，通过连续渲染和语义对齐实现了高质量的修复效果，为2D图像处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Conclusion: MOSAIC为复杂多主体合成应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Method: 引入VARIN技术，利用LAI方法生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现图像重建和编辑。

Result: VARIN能根据提示有效编辑图像，同时保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN是一种实用的图像编辑方法，适用于VAR模型。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，优于更大的模型。

Conclusion: 明确将设计责任分配给理解模块对图像编辑有显著好处。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

### [175] [Palette Aligned Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02000)
*Elad Aharoni,Noy Porat,Dani Lischinski,Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter是一种新方法，用于在文本到图像扩散模型中根据用户指定的调色板生成图像。通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图并引入两个控制参数，解决了调色板条件生成中的模糊性和不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流中广泛使用，但用于图像生成时会引入模糊性和不稳定性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个控制参数，并设计负直方图机制以抑制不希望的色调。

Result: 方法在定性、定量和用户研究中均优于现有方法，实现了强调色板一致性和高图像质量。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过灵活的控制机制和负直方图设计，显著提升了调色板条件图像生成的稳定性和语义一致性。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

### [176] [Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant Behavior in Low-Resource Care Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02018)
*Stanley Mugisha,Rashid Kisitu,Francis Komakech,Excellence Favor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的非侵入式自动监测系统，用于实时检测早产儿的行为状态，具有高准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡的主要原因，尤其在资源匮乏地区，现有监测方法依赖人工或侵入式传感器，存在误差和不实用性。

Method: 采用量化MobileNet模型部署在树莓派上，实现实时行为状态检测，并优化了视觉管道和安全物联网通信。

Result: 系统在公开数据集上达到91.8%的睡眠检测准确率和97.7%的哭闹/正常分类准确率，模型大小减少68%。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型（如MobileNet）是构建可扩展、低成本且临床可操作的NICU监测系统的最可行方案。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of
vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard
negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple
yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned
representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S
and Swin-T architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT)系统的安全漏洞，提出了VEIL对抗框架，揭示了其在设计和逻辑上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言-视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和安全性尚未充分研究。论文旨在揭示RMOT系统的对抗性漏洞。

Method: 通过设计逻辑分析，识别了RMOT系统的对抗性漏洞，并提出了VEIL框架，通过数字和物理扰动破坏其跟踪逻辑。

Result: 实验表明，VEIL能有效破坏RMOT系统的跟踪逻辑，导致跟踪ID切换和终止。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在关键大规模应用中设计安全感知的RMOT系统的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在视觉Transformer中利用合成数据增强自监督学习的方法，提出了Syn2Co框架，结合生成模型和合成硬负样本，评估了合成数据对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何减少对大量真实数据和精心设计的硬负样本的依赖，通过合成数据提升自监督学习的多样性和挑战性。

Method: 提出了Syn2Co框架，结合生成模型生成合成数据以增强样本多样性，并在表示空间中生成合成硬负样本。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据在自监督学习中具有一定潜力，但也存在局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以增强自监督学习的鲁棒性和可迁移性，但其效果和适用范围仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

### [180] [ContextFusion and Bootstrap: An Effective Approach to Improve Slot Attention-Based Object-Centric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02032)
*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的slot attention方法，通过ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch解决现有方法缺乏高级语义信息和编码器微调能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有slot attention方法依赖低层次特征且无法灵活微调编码器，限制了对象轮廓和语义的理解。

Method: 引入ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景语义信息，以及Bootstrap Branch实现特征自适应机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了现有slot attention的局限性，提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本描述引导的合成数据增强方法，用于改进行人属性识别（PAR），特别是在处理代表性不足的属性时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于训练数据集中某些属性的代表性不足，导致识别性能受限。

Method: 通过定义协议识别弱识别属性，利用扩散模型生成合成行人图像，并设计策略将合成样本无缝融入训练数据。

Result: 在多个PAR数据集上，该方法不仅提升了对代表性不足属性的识别，还提高了整体模型性能，且无需改变模型架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进行人属性识别提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于零样本泛化场景。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别性逻辑异常检测方法，通过显式建模对象组成图的分布，显著提升了逻辑异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）时表现不佳，主要依赖于预训练特征或手工描述符，导致空间和语义信息丢失。

Method: SALAD引入了一个新的组成分支来建模对象组成图的分布，并提出了一种无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组成图提取方法。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上，SALAD达到了96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SALAD通过有效建模组成图分布，显著提升了逻辑异常检测的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

TL;DR: NOOUGAT是一种新型多目标跟踪器，通过统一的GNN框架和ALT层，解决了在线和离线跟踪的局限性，实现了灵活的时间范围处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线和离线多目标跟踪方法在时间灵活性上存在局限，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 采用统一的GNN框架处理非重叠子片段，并通过ALT层融合，支持从帧级到批处理的不同场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在线模式下AssA显著提升。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT首次实现了任意时间范围的多目标跟踪，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全向场景理解在多个应用中至关重要，但现有方法忽略了跨帧关联的全景图像，因此需要新的数据集和方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了CFpano数据集，包含2700多张图像和8000多个问答对，并基于MLLM开发了GRPO优化的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项选择和开放式VQA任务中均达到最优性能，整体性能提升5.37%。

Conclusion: CFpano和提出的方法为全景场景理解建立了新基准，验证了GRPO的有效性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Motivation: 当前VLM模型在空间关系理解方面表现不足，需要一个新的基准测试来评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 通过构建全新的真实世界图像-文本对，测试模型对相对空间关系和物体顺序的理解能力，并进行解耦分析。

Result: 实验显示开源和商业VLM模型在空间关系理解上表现不佳，而推理模型表现较好，性能瓶颈在于空间推理而非物体定位。

Conclusion: RocketScience基准测试揭示了VLM模型在空间关系理解上的不足，并提供了开源数据集和评估代码以促进研究。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过特征相关性挖掘有效提升了人群计数的准确性，尤其在多视角和多姿态场景中。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Motivation: 遥感图像中的OOD检测面临数据稀缺、多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移的挑战，现有方法不适用。

Method: 提出RS-OOD框架，结合空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制和自训练循环，实现少样本OOD检测。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且能高效适应少量标注数据。

Conclusion: RS-OOD展示了空间-语义集成在遥感OOD检测中的关键价值。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Conclusion: SynthGenNet通过多源合成数据和自监督策略，有效解决了复杂城市环境中的域泛化问题，减少了目标数据标注依赖。

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Motivation: 现有方法通过微调或手工设计的损失函数优化空间推理，效果有限且不够灵活。

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架，训练轻量级分类器从交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，并将其作为学习损失函数。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev和SD2.1基准上，空间准确性分别从0.20提升到0.61和从0.07提升到0.54。

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer不仅显著提升了空间准确性，还能泛化到多种关系，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有代理研究主要关注GUI或实体场景，但复杂任务需要代理在两种环境中交替交互，而混合训练会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出分层异构MoE，分离深层参数以消除冲突，共享浅层参数以利用协同；统一动作空间并收集大规模数据。

Result: OmniActor在GUI和实体任务中均优于单一数据训练的代理，尤其在GUI任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: OmniActor通过结构设计和数据优化，成功解决了多模态代理在混合环境中的挑战，为通用代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数分类任务中标签噪声问题严重，影响模型性能，需要一种有效的方法来校正噪声。

Method: 提出ORDAC方法，利用标签分布学习（LDL）动态调整标签分布的均值和标准差，校正噪声标签。

Result: 在Adience和Diabetic Retinopathy数据集上，ORDAC显著降低了误差并提高了召回率。

Conclusion: 自适应标签校正策略能有效提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Method: 通过MulSeT基准测试，在单视图、多视图和视频三种场景下评估MLLMs的空间推理能力，并从数据和架构角度分析性能瓶颈。

Result: 数据方面，空间理解的性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，但上限较低；架构方面，空间理解更依赖视觉编码器的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以提升性能，未来需通过架构优化（如推理注入）改进空间理解能力。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏跨模态和跨机构的通用性。视觉基础模型（FMs）虽强大，但在医学图像分割中仍面临性能不足和领域差距问题。

Method: 通过重新设计ViT架构并引入多尺度标记聚合，结合在CT-3M数据集上的多阶段DINOv3预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征。

Conclusion: MedDINOv3展示了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough

achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all

Result: 在六个公开数据集上验证，GSD-Net在噪声标注下表现最优，提升显著。

Conclusion: GSD-Net有效提升模型对噪声标注的鲁棒性，适用于实际医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的协作蒸馏与自学习框架，用于红外与可见光图像融合，显著提升了轻量级模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近期有进展，但如何用轻量级模型实现高质量图像融合仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过强化学习驱动的协作蒸馏与自学习框架，学生模型不仅从教师模型学习，还能通过自学习增强能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了学生模型的性能，并优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为轻量级图像融合提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

### [204] [Towards High-Fidelity, Identity-Preserving Real-Time Makeup Transfer: Decoupling Style Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02445)
*Lydia Kin Ching Chau,Zhi Yu,Ruo Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时虚拟化妆试用的新框架，通过两步分解（透明化妆掩模提取和基于图形的掩模渲染）实现高保真、身份保持的化妆转移，并具有强时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以分离半透明化妆品与肤色及其他身份特征，导致身份偏移和时间不一致，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将化妆转移分解为透明化妆掩模提取和基于图形的掩模渲染两步，并通过伪真实数据训练提取模型，辅以专门训练目标增强透明度和颜色保真度。

Result: 在多样姿态、表情和肤色下实现鲁棒的化妆转移，保持时间平滑性，实验表明在细节捕捉、时间稳定性和身份完整性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有技术的局限性，为实时化妆试用提供了高效且身份保持的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiverScope是一个高分辨率数据集，用于监测河流和地表水动态，显著提高了河流宽度估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测河流和地表水在精细时空尺度上的动态对气候系统、生态系统和可持续发展至关重要，但现有卫星数据难以捕捉狭窄或泥沙丰富的河流。

Method: 通过计算机科学与水文学专家的合作，开发了包含1,145张高分辨率图像的数据集，并结合Sentinel-2、SWOT和SWORD数据进行多传感器评估。

Result: RiverScope在河流宽度估计中实现了7.2米的中位误差，显著优于现有卫星方法，并通过多种深度学习架构和训练策略验证了其性能。

Conclusion: RiverScope为精细尺度和多传感器水文建模提供了宝贵资源，支持气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaoyu Li,Xiaodong Cun,Guangzhi Wang,Lingen Li,Ying Shan,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成模型的自动化视频合成方法，通过Diffusion Transformer（DiT）实现动态元素的交互式注入，显著提升了视频合成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频合成流程依赖人工和专家协作，成本高且周期长，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计了基于DiT的管道，包括背景保留分支、DiT融合块和新型位置嵌入（ERoPE），并构建了VideoComp数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 生成式视频合成通过自动化显著提升了视频合成的效率和质量，为视频创作提供了新工具。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeRA是一个高效的两阶段文本到3D头像生成框架，优于之前的SDS和大型3D生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到3D头像生成模型效率低、优化慢的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先蒸馏解码器构建结构化潜在空间，再训练文本控制的潜在扩散模型。

Result: 实验证明TeRA在主观和客观评估中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TeRA通过消除迭代优化和结构化表示，实现了高效且可定制的3D头像生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

### [208] [Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488)
*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的位置编码方法AFPE，针对医学图像的各向异性特点，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法（如SPE和IFPE）在医学图像处理中存在局限性，无法有效处理各向异性和复杂形状。

Method: 提出Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE)，结合各向异性、类别和领域特定的空间依赖性。

Result: AFPE在多项任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其是在各向异性数据中表现突出。

Conclusion: 在医学图像处理中，选择适合数据和各向异性的位置编码方法至关重要。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型计算量大，难以在实时或资源受限环境中应用，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 集成预训练的2D CNN（如ResNet50、EfficientNet、ViT）与LSTM网络，并通过空间注意力机制增强。

Result: 在UCF101数据集子集上达到93.34%的准确率，优于现有HAR系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为健身动作识别提供了可扩展且实时可行的解决方案，适用于健康监测等领域。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合模态联邦学习框架（MDM-MixMFL），用于解决非集中式混合模态MRI图像分割中的模态和数据异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要基于集中式多模态范式，不适用于非集中式混合模态场景，存在模态和数据异质性问题。

Method: 通过模态解耦策略和模态记忆机制，将模态信息分解为模态专属和共享部分，并动态更新共享模态原型。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL框架能够稳定适应异构数据和模态的联邦学习，提升MRI图像分割性能。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR是一种无监督多目标发现方法，通过运动分割和自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR的扩展，无需人工监督即可生成高质量伪标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖监督生成伪标签训练OCL模型，限制了无监督多目标发现的潜力。

Method: 利用无监督光流进行运动分割，生成高质量伪标签，并训练槽停用模块区分前景和背景。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有全无监督方法。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR通过简单设计实现了高效的无监督多目标发现。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉基础模型在处理长序列图像输入时存在推理效率低下的问题，尤其是VGGT模型中的token崩溃现象限制了其扩展性。

Method: 提出FastVGGT，首次在3D领域应用token合并技术，设计了针对3D架构和任务的独特token分区策略，减少冗余计算。

Result: 在多个3D几何基准测试中，FastVGGT在1000张输入图像下实现了4倍加速，同时减少了长序列场景中的误差累积。

Conclusion: token合并是一种可扩展3D视觉系统的有效解决方案，FastVGGT展示了其在提升效率和保持重建能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Result: 通过文本和图像数据验证了方法的有效性，提供了理解时间数据的新视角。

Conclusion: Chronotome为探索时间数据的语义和美学变化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are
difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address
this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based
projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of
embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for
interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image
data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and
semantics of temporal datasets.

Result: 该方法在多种光照、肤色和运动条件下表现准确，并能提供丰富的输入元数据。

Conclusion: 该技术为皮肤输入提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案，有望推动相关应用发展。

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

TL;DR: FlashAdventure是一个包含34款Flash冒险游戏的基准测试，旨在评估GUI代理完成完整故事情节的能力，并解决观察-行为差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，且很少评估代理完成完整故事情节的能力，因此需要一个新的测试平台。

Method: 提出了FlashAdventure基准测试、CUA-as-a-Judge自动评估器和COAST代理框架，后者利用长期线索记忆来规划任务。

Result: 实验表明当前GUI代理在完整故事情节上表现不佳，而COAST通过解决观察-行为差距提高了里程碑完成率。

Conclusion: 尽管COAST有所改进，但人类与最佳代理之间仍存在显著差距，需进一步研究缩小这一差距。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ARLT方法存在任务特定代码库的碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性差的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: VerlTool通过上游对齐VeRL、统一工具管理、异步执行和多模态支持，提供了一个模块化框架。

Result: 在6个ARLT领域（如数学推理、知识问答等）中表现优异，速度提升近2倍，且开发开销显著降低。

Conclusion: VerlTool为工具增强的RL研究提供了可扩展的基础，支持快速工具集成和统一训练基础设施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人系统在复杂指令、长期任务规划和自然交互中的挑战，Robix旨在提供一个端到端的解决方案。

Method: 采用三阶段训练策略：持续预训练、监督微调和强化学习，结合链式思维推理。

Result: Robix在交互任务执行中优于开源和商业基线（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix通过统一的视觉-语言架构，显著提升了机器人的推理、规划和交互能力。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

*Mridul Kumar,Yevgeny Rakita*

TL;DR: 通过无监督机器学习分析4D-STEM数据，揭示了Ge-Sb-Te合金中纳米尺度的成分和结构异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以解析相变材料（PCMs）中纳米尺度的成分和结构变化，因此需要新方法来研究其功能特性。

Method: 使用PCA降维，结合t-SNE、UMAP和k-means聚类，通过轮廓评分优化聚类分析。

Result: 识别出四个具有不同成分和结构特征的簇，证实了PCMs中的局部异质性。

Conclusion: 聚类分析为关联PCMs中的化学和结构特征提供了有力框架，有助于深入理解其内在异质性。

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those
associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of
a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different
visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble
models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The
findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic
screening of PD.

Result: PyramidAI将处理数据量减少至多2.65倍，分析时间从一小时缩短至几分钟。

Conclusion: PyramidAI为大规模图像分析提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of

All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired

that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Motivation: 理解铰接物体的3D运动对机器人场景理解、移动操作和运动规划至关重要，但现有方法在无约束环境中表现不佳。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪和因子图优化，直接从RGB-D视频中估计铰接部分轨迹和轴。

Result: 在Arti4D数据集上，ArtiPoint表现优于多种经典和基于学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint在无约束环境中表现出色，同时发布了Arti4D数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上展示了最先进的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R$^2$显著提升了自动驾驶系统的推理和自反思能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Motivation: 现代机器人操作主要依赖2D视觉观察，但泛化能力较差。人类依赖3D几何信息（如距离、大小和形状）与物体交互，因此希望通过深度摄像头赋予机器人类似感知能力。

Method: 开发了CDMs插件，结合RGB图像和原始深度信号，输出去噪后的精确深度。通过模拟深度摄像头的噪声模式，生成高质量配对数据。

Result: CDMs在深度预测上达到接近模拟级别的精度，显著缩小了模拟与现实的差距。实验显示，基于模拟深度训练的策略无需额外噪声或微调即可无缝迁移到现实机器人任务。

Conclusion: CDMs成功提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，为未来利用模拟数据和3D信息的机器人策略研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的扩散模型加速框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，显著提高了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现优异，但计算成本高，现有加速方法受限于采样轨迹效率。

Method: 提出A-FloPS框架，将采样轨迹重新参数化为流匹配形式，并引入自适应速度分解。

Result: 在极低函数评估次数下，A-FloPS在图像生成质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: A-FloPS是高质量、低延迟生成建模的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Result: 后处理方法（如阈值调整）在故障检测中F1分数提升最高（15.3%），生成式AI在故障识别中性能提升最大（24.2%）。

Conclusion: 不同场景下最优方法不同：故障检测推荐后处理，故障识别推荐生成式AI；低延迟需求时过采样方法更优，无延迟限制时元学习最佳。

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

<details>

Motivation: STE忽略了离散化误差，导致低比特量化时精度下降。PEGE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PEGE采用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，逐步量化权重和激活值，并同时优化任务损失和量化误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，PEGE优于现有方法，低比特模型甚至可媲美全精度模型。

Conclusion: PEGE为量化训练提供了统一且通用的框架，显著提升了低比特量化的性能。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Result: 在1428家中国中小企业的数据集上，IMST准确率达88.9%，优于基准模型。

Conclusion: IMST在准确性、可解释性和计算效率上均优于传统模型。

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Conclusion: AMCR为生成模型的安全部署提供了实用解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

Result: 显著减少平均遗忘，提高准确性，同时降低内存使用和运行时间。

Conclusion: FoRo为预训练模型的持续学习提供了高效且有效的解决方案，适用于多媒体应用。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: BM-CL为公平且有效的机器学习系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上潜在空间分配不均，导致尾部类别生成效果差。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，使用每类Student's t联合先验和γ-幂散度优化目标，并推导了类别平衡的潜在混合分布。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE的FID分数更低，尤其在严重类别不平衡时表现更优。

Conclusion: Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提高了生成公平性和多样性，尤其在极端不平衡情况下优于高斯基VAE。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向全身CT中病变的准确分割对疾病进展和治疗反应监测至关重要，但现有方法在跨时间跟踪个体病变方面存在局限。

Method: 扩展了LongiSeg框架，引入可提示功能，并通过大规模合成纵向CT数据集进行预训练。

Result: 预训练显著提升了纵向上下文的利用能力，Dice分数提高了6点。

Conclusion: 结合纵向上下文和交互式提示的病变跟踪方法有效且鲁棒。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

### [248] [Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00866)
*Yizhe Zhang,Qiang Chen,Tao Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Omnimodels vs. specialist models in medical image segmentation show task-dependent performance, with omnimodels excelling in robustness on hard cases but not universally replacing specialists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if general-purpose omnimodels can match specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains like medical image segmentation.

Method: Comparative study of zero-shot performance of an omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro) vs. specialist models on polyp, retinal vessel, and breast tumor segmentation tasks, focusing on easy and hard cases.

Result: Omnimodels outperform specialists on hard cases for polyp and breast tumor segmentation but lag in retinal vessel segmentation. They show higher sensitivity to subtle features.

Conclusion: Omnimodels are not yet universal replacements but offer complementary strengths, especially for robustness on challenging cases.

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Motivation: 现有乳腺癌风险预测模型性能有限且未整合DBT影像，亟需改进。

Method: 使用Meta AI DINOv2图像编码器提取特征，结合累积风险层，训练风险预测模型。

Result: 在测试集上，模型5年内预测的AUROC为0.80。

Conclusion: DBT结合深度学习在乳腺癌风险评估中潜力巨大，可作为传统工具的补充。

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Conclusion: 融合列线图优于独立模型和人工评估，有望优化乳腺影像决策。

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型加速方法未充分利用说话头生成任务中的时空冗余性，导致推理速度慢。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升推理速度，同时保持视频质量。

Conclusion: 该任务特定框架有效解决了扩散式说话头模型的推理效率问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Conclusion: 通过直接在3D扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，结合多种技术手段，该方法显著提升了3D编辑的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Conclusion: LatentEdit提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了实时部署效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: RealMat通过结合合成数据和真实照片，成功提升了生成材料的真实感。

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Conclusion: GRMM通过结合残差学习和高质量数据集，实现了高保真度和实时性能，为3D人脸建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.
