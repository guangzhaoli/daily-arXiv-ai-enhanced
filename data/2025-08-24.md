### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种替代Soft-argmax的训练目标，基于经典的结构化预测框架，在面部关键点检测任务中实现了更快的收敛和竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视长期使用的Soft-argmax方法，探索是否可以通过其他方式实现高性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标。

Result: 在三个面部关键点基准测试（WFLW、COFW和300W）上实现了最先进的性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好/竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 结构化预测框架是Soft-argmax的有效替代方案，能够提升训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将图卷积网络（GCNs）与Voronoi图结合的新方法，用于提升图像分类的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络（CNNs）在处理复杂数据结构和关系时存在局限性，而GCNs能够更好地建模关系数据。通过结合Voronoi图，可以进一步优化图像的表征。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构，其中像素或区域作为顶点，并通过Delaunay三角剖分优化图的表征。结合GCNs和Voronoi图进行图像分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法在预处理效率和分类准确性上均显著优于现有技术，尤其是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为图像分类提供了新视角，还拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一种单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，无需额外数据即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要一个更简单的、仅使用RGB图像的替代方案。

Method: YOPO通过轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，扩展了transformer检测器。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，YOPO实现了79.6%的IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越了之前的RGB-only方法。

Conclusion: YOPO展示了无需额外数据即可统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计的可行性，并取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的训练框架（Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework），用于同时检测物理和数字伪造攻击，显著降低了系统复杂性和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别系统容易受到物理和数字伪造攻击，传统方法需要分别处理这两种攻击，增加了系统复杂性和延迟。

Method: 采用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对，学习模态无关的活体检测特征。

Result: 在第六届人脸反欺骗挑战赛的统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率（ACER）为2.10%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量高效（4.46 GFLOPs，训练时间小于1小时），适合实际部署。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒方法，通过仅3-20步采样生成高质量对抗图像，攻击效果显著且速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成对抗图像时计算资源消耗大、图像质量低的问题。

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，结合选择性RGB通道策略（红色通道用注意力图，绿色和蓝色通道用GradCAM引导扰动）。

Result: 在ImageNet上，对ResNet、MNASNet和ShuffleNet的攻击成功率分别为70.6%、80.8%和97.8%，生成速度快10倍。

Conclusion: TAIGen是一种高效且攻击效果显著的对抗图像生成方法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ 是一种可逆展开网络，结合生成细化，用于隐蔽视觉感知（CVP），通过多阶段网络和扩散模型解决不确定性，提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 CVP 方法多局限于掩码域，RGB 域潜力未充分挖掘，RUN++ 旨在通过可逆建模和扩散模型解决这一问题。

Method: RUN++ 将 CVP 任务建模为优化问题，展开为多阶段网络，包含 CORE、CARE 和 FINE 模块，分别处理掩码域、RGB 域和细化不确定区域。

Result: RUN++ 显著减少误报和漏报，通过扩散模型高效细化不确定区域，提升分割精度。

Conclusion: RUN++ 提供了一种新的 CVP 系统范式，结合可逆建模和扩散模型，适用于实际场景中的退化问题。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率引导的非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性轨迹的rectified flow模型可能迫使生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，结合曲率正则化技术学习平滑非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO数据集上实现SOTA性能，尤其在语义一致性指标（BLEU等）上表现突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模能有效增强模型遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一种自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排名和质量对齐实现高质量嵌入，无需依赖主观标签或参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无参考图像质量评估中数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，提高泛化性能。

Method: 结合排名和对比学习，引入高阶排名损失和嵌入距离损失，通过结构化文本提示增强表示。

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上表现出色，HiRQA-S变体实现实时推理（3.5 ms/图像）。

Conclusion: HiRQA在性能、泛化能力和可扩展性方面达到SOTA水平。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在多视图3D重建中应对系统中断，保证重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘环境的动态性和操作挑战可能导致相机操作中断，进而影响重建质量，需要一种可靠的管理策略。

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的方法，结合遗传算法优化相机选择，以应对时空相关的中断。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公开和定制数据集上优于传统基线策略，能有效保证重建质量。

Conclusion: 提出的策略在多视图3D重建中能可靠应对系统中断，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

TL;DR: XDR-LVLM是一种结合视觉语言大模型的可解释性糖尿病视网膜病变诊断框架，通过自然语言解释提升临床透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变诊断中缺乏透明度和可解释性的问题。

Method: 整合医学视觉编码器、LVLM核心，采用多任务提示工程和多阶段微调，生成包含病变特征和诊断解释的综合报告。

Result: 在DDR数据集上表现优异，疾病诊断平衡准确率84.55%，F1分数79.92%，概念检测结果也领先。

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM通过提供可解释的诊断报告，有效弥合自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出MeSS方法，通过改进图像扩散模型生成高质量、风格一致的户外场景，解决了城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理，限制了其在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 使用级联外绘ControlNets生成几何一致的稀疏视图；2) 通过AGInpaint传播更密集的中间视图；3) 使用GCAlign模块消除视觉不一致性。同时，通过3D高斯泼溅重建场景。

Result: 方法在几何对齐和生成质量上优于现有方法，支持多样化的风格渲染。

Conclusion: MeSS方法有效提升了城市网格模型的纹理质量，适用于虚拟导航和自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline
is publicly available at: https://github.com/ddrrnn123/DyMorph-B2I.

Motivation: 通过低成本且易于部署的行车记录仪视频输入，提高交通事故预测的准确性，从而提升道路安全。

Method: 结合更好的时空特征，并通过循环网络聚合这些特征，改进现有的图神经网络方法。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM是一种新型的3D生成模型，通过整合多模态数据（如RGB、RGBD和点云）来提升3D资产的纹理和几何细节生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，忽略了多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的多样性。

Method: TriMM采用协作多模态编码整合不同模态特征，并引入2D和3D辅助监督提升鲁棒性，最后使用三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。

Result: 实验表明，TriMM在小规模训练数据下仍能实现与大规模数据集训练的模型相媲美的性能，并能扩展到其他多模态数据集。

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，显著提升了3D生成的质量和多样性，为多模态3D建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向中心的原型对比聚类框架，通过软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块解决类间冲突和原型漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过原型对比解决类间冲突问题，但硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差。

Method: 采用软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块，前者通过样本属于聚类中心的概率加权计算原型，后者对齐样本的不同变换和邻域。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了类间冲突和原型漂移问题，提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双高度无人机协作视觉与语言导航任务（DuAl-VLN），并构建了HaL-13k数据集和AeroDuo框架，以提升无人机在复杂环境中的导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无人机轨迹长且机动性复杂，传统视觉与语言导航任务难以实现可靠性能，需要多粒度视角和可管理的运动空间。

Method: 通过高、低空无人机协作，分别负责环境推理和精确导航，构建HaL-13k数据集，并提出AeroDuo框架，结合多模态大语言模型和轻量级多阶段策略。

Result: HaL-13k数据集包含13,838条协作轨迹，AeroDuo框架通过协作实现了高效导航和目标定位。

Conclusion: DuAl-VLN任务和AeroDuo框架为无人机导航提供了新思路，显著提升了复杂环境下的导航性能。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，通过马尔可夫方式加速扩散模型的生成过程，同时保持与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但其顺序生成过程需要大量步骤，现有方法（如DDIM）通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步骤，但缺乏对原始扩散过程是否可以实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，绕过迭代生成过程中的多个中间去噪步骤，并证明该机制与标准扩散模型的训练目标一致。此外，将加速采样技术与DDIM结合，提出增强的生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的实验表明，该方法能以显著减少的采样步骤实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是预训练扩散模型的内在特性，通过马尔可夫方式加速采样是可行的，且与DDIM结合可进一步提升生成效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Motivation: 传统图像编码模式有限且依赖人工选择，对非专业用户不友好，因此需要一种更智能的解决方案。

Method: 提出多功能编码框架统一不同编码模式，设计交互式编码代理通过上下文学习理解用户需求，并建立IIC-bench基准测试。

Result: Comp-X 能高效理解编码需求，保持压缩性能，并展现出色的文本交互能力。

Conclusion: Comp-X 为图像压缩领域的人工通用智能（AGI）提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

TL;DR: RATopo提出了一种冗余分配策略，通过改进Transformer解码器结构，实现更丰富的车道拓扑监督，提升自动驾驶中的拓扑推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于一对一分配的检测结果进行监督，导致拓扑推理性能受限。

Method: 交换Transformer解码器的交叉注意力和自注意力层，保留冗余车道预测，并实例化多个并行交叉注意力块。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，RATopo显著提升了车道-车道和车道-交通元素的拓扑推理性能。

Conclusion: RATopo是一种模型无关的策略，可无缝集成到现有框架中，有效提升拓扑推理能力。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Conclusion: 多模态方法在专利分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频中的图像噪声和探头位置变化阻碍了先天性心脏病的检测，现有方法常忽略时间信息且缺乏预测校准。

Method: TPA利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过时间提取器捕捉心脏运动，并使用CVAESM模块量化不确定性。

Result: TPA在CHD诊断中达到85.40%的宏F1分数，并显著降低校准误差。

Conclusion: TPA通过整合时间建模和不确定性量化，显著提升了超声视频中先天性心脏病的分类性能。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 实验表明，方法在遮挡条件下仍保持高追踪性能，且实现传统摄像头方法难以达到的实时性。

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR数据集和算法为体育MOT领域提供了新解决方案，显著提升实时3D追踪能力。

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Motivation: 伪装目标检测（COD）因目标与背景高度相似而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖大量训练资源，而基础模型如SAM需高质量提示且需微调。

Method: RAG-SEG将COD分为两阶段：检索增强生成（RAG）生成粗掩码作为提示，再通过SAM分割（SEG）细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上，RAG-SEG性能与或优于现有方法，且仅需个人笔记本即可运行。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种高效、无需训练的COD解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Motivation: 由于文本到视频扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容，需要一种方法来防止其生成不良概念。

Method: VideoEraser采用选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗对抗噪声引导（ARNG）两阶段过程，作为即插即用模块集成到现有模型中。

Result: VideoEraser在四个任务中表现优异，平均减少46%的不良内容生成，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VideoEraser是一种高效、鲁棒且通用的解决方案，能够有效抑制文本到视频扩散模型中的不良内容生成。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous

require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实证研究揭示了Video-LLMs的内部机制，发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，某些中间层对问答任务影响显著，且时空建模更依赖语言引导检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注性能提升，而忽视了对Video-LLMs内部机制的理解，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体，并通过全局和细粒度设置进行分析。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，某些中间层是关键异常点，时空建模依赖语言引导检索。

Conclusion: 研究为Video-LLMs的机制提供了可解释性和效率优化的新视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和高计算成本，BioTune旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BioTune使用进化算法选择性地微调层，优化目标任务的模型性能。

Result: 在九个图像分类数据集上，BioTune在准确性和效率上优于或与现有方法（如AutoRGN和LoRA）相当。

Conclusion: BioTune通过选择性微调层减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，提升了迁移学习效率。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer 是一种用于 3D 高斯溅射（3DGS）压缩的新方法，显著提高了压缩效率并支持存档后的场景变化适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 3DGS 压缩方法仅适用于中等规模场景且缺乏对存档后场景变化的适应机制。

Method: 通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，并使用跨场景共享的固定码本，ICGS-Quantizer 提高了量化效率，并通过图像条件解码支持场景更新。

Result: ICGS-Quantizer 将存储需求降至千字节级，同时在压缩效率和场景变化适应性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer 为大规模 3D 场景压缩和长期存档提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 驾驶场景中快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景对3D场景重建提出了挑战，现有方法在解耦动态和静态组件时忽略了背景优化和几何关系，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用区域体素初始化方案分区场景，引入可变形神经高斯建模动态对象，并通过预训练模型的深度和法线先验监督框架。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上验证了DriveSplat在新视角合成中的先进性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过改进的动态-静态解耦和几何优化，显著提升了驾驶场景重建的质量和准确性。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 论文通过因果链建模和DIO模型揭示了深度学习在抽象推理中的挑战，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 短视频内容兴起，现有视频摘要技术难以捕捉全局时间依赖性和保持语义连贯性，且多通道特征融合易受噪声影响。

Method: 结合脉冲神经网络（SNN）设计关键帧提取器，引入动态聚合图推理器进行细粒度推理，并通过变分推断重建模块减少噪声和不确定性。

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpiVG通过脉冲神经网络和变分推理有效提升了视频摘要的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在视觉基础模型中表现强大，但在新数据集上需要大量超参数调优，且其超参数与下游任务性能的关系尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过分析线性MAE学习的特征，并扩展到非线性MAE，研究MAE如何适应数据集的空间相关性。

Result: 研究发现掩码比例和块大小可以选择捕捉短程和长程空间相关性的特征，且MAE表示能适应数据集的高阶统计特性。

Conclusion: 论文提供了关于如何选择MAE超参数的实用见解。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向信息传播和联合优化，显著提升了红外小目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42在检测微小缺陷方面表现出色，更适合实际应用，尽管收敛速度较慢。

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Method: 提出MATR模型，采用双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练技术，结合前景/背景分类和边界预测头。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上分别实现了13.1%和14.7%的R@1提升。

Conclusion: MATR在视频到视频时刻检索任务中表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法在极稀疏视角下显著优于现有技术，实现了高质量的3D场景重建和渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医学场景中具有实际部署潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新方法提升了多模态图像融合的效果，同时保持了低计算成本和紧凑网络。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于轨迹外推的整体框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过新颖的Road Surface Gaussian表示和Far Field Gaussians提升外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志中合成外推视图对自动驾驶车辆的场景模拟至关重要，但现有方法常导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: ExtraGS采用混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示和Far Field Gaussians，并结合基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架。

Result: 在多个数据集和生成先验上的实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了外推视图中的几何一致性和渲染质量问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

*Guotao Liang,Juncheng Hu,Ximing Xing,Jing Zhang,Qian Yu*

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程（运动初始化和运动细化）处理多对象交互和复杂运动，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限性，如单对象限制、时间不一致性和泛化能力差。GroupSketch旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化（语义分组和关键帧定义）；2）运动细化（基于组的位移网络GDN，结合文本到视频模型的先验和CCFE模块）。

Result: 实验表明，GroupSketch在多对象草图动画中生成高质量、时间一致的结果，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch通过创新方法解决了复杂草图动画的挑战，扩展了其实际应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet提出了一种用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度道路分割的网络，通过差分注意力、双流解码和多尺度膨胀策略提升窄道路提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 窄道路提取因宽度有限、拓扑断裂和遮挡而具有挑战性，现有模型难以处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度道路。

Method: D3FNet基于D-LinkNet，引入差分注意力膨胀提取模块（DADE）、双流解码融合机制（DDFM）和多尺度膨胀策略。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在IoU和召回率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: D3FNet通过注意力引导编码和双路径解码的协同作用，成为复杂场景中窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推断建模类条件特征分布，提升零样本鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时自适应方法依赖反向传播和缺乏类条件特征分布建模的问题。

Method: 将TTA重构为高斯概率推断任务，利用逐步更新的类均值和共享协方差矩阵，结合CLIP先验和历史知识库进行正则化。

Result: 在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能，具有高扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT无需源数据、梯度更新或完整目标数据，适用于在线和转导设置。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过自适应权重分配改善隐式神经表示（INR）中的高频细节捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决INR中神经网络频谱偏差问题，即难以捕捉高频细节（如锐利边缘和精细纹理）。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先通过邻居感知软掩码为局部变化大的像素分配更高权重，鼓励早期关注细节；随后过渡到全图像训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能一致提升重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补。

Conclusion: 首次在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SDP松弛）在解决点云配准问题时耗时过长，无法满足实时性需求。

Method: 采用线性时间凸松弛和承包商方法优化BnB算法。

Result: 在旋转轴已知的情况下，能够在半秒内完成100点3D点云配准，比现有SDP方法快两个数量级。

Conclusion: 新方法在保证全局最优性的同时大幅提升了计算效率，适用于高离群率场景。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT 是一种视频语言模型，通过引入三种创新设计，解决了现有视频LLM在时间感知上的不足，实现了更精细的时间推理和实体对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知上表现粗糙，如时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移。

Method: 1. 扩散时间潜在编码器（DTL）增强边界敏感性和时间一致性；2. 基于对象的表示显式绑定查询实体与视觉证据；3. 混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在 Charades STA、NExT GQA 和多个 VideoQA 基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT 通过创新设计显著提升了视频理解中的时间感知和实体对齐能力。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人类操作员的质量评级来改进树实例分割模型，性能提升了34%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据变化和精确标注成本高，传统的全监督方法在ALS数据中树实例分割效果不佳。

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法生成初始分割结果，人类操作员进行质量评级，训练评级模型并反馈给分割模型进行微调。

Result: 分割模型在正确识别树实例方面提升了34%，同时减少了非树实例的预测。

Conclusion: 方法在稀疏林区或复杂环境中对小树或灌木等物体的分割性能仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，因此研究无需模型信息的转移攻击方法。

Method: 通过计算提取特征的重要性，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN数据集上，CFG大幅优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: CFG通过关键特征引导提高了对抗点云的转移性，同时保证了不可感知性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD框架有效解决了跨模态知识迁移问题，显著提升了轻量级视觉模型的性能，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Motivation: 现有的LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素，而LoD3模型虽能解决这一问题，但其生成依赖手动建模，难以大规模应用。

Method: 通过分析真实与合成的冲突图（CMs）进行语义分割，并结合纹理模型的置信度融合，提高分割性能和3D重建精度。

Result: 实验表明，CM2LoD3在分割和重建建筑开口方面表现有效，结合纹理分割后性能提升61%。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LoD3模型的自动化重建，为高效、可扩展的3D城市建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多维度动态提示路由（MDPR）框架，用于解决预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）在类别不平衡场景下微调时的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在视觉任务中表现优异，但其微调过程容易受到类别不平衡的影响，导致偏差累积。现有方法引入大型语言模型（LLM）补充语义信息，但忽略了VLM预训练中的固有类别不平衡问题。

Method: MDPR框架构建了一个涵盖五个视觉语义维度的类别知识库，通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示并平衡细粒度语义，最终通过logits融合实现稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中，MDPR取得了与当前最优方法相当的结果。消融实验验证了语义库对尾部类别的有效性，且动态路由计算开销极小。

Conclusion: MDPR是一种灵活高效的VLM微调增强方法，适用于数据不平衡场景。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种用于流式视频理解的查询无关KV缓存内存机制，通过流式编码新视频帧并压缩KV缓存，实现了在内存受限的长视频场景中的高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不切实际。StreamMem旨在解决这一问题。

Method: StreamMem以流式方式编码新视频帧，利用视觉标记与通用查询标记之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，并保持固定大小的KV内存。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话提供了一种高效的解决方案，显著减少了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable

TL;DR: WorldWeaver是一个用于长视频生成的框架，通过联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，显著提升了时间一致性和运动动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致长序列中对象结构和运动的累积误差。

Method: 联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库，并采用分段噪声调度。

Result: 实验表明，WorldWeaver有效减少了时间漂移，提升了生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver在长视频生成中表现出色，解决了时间一致性和结构保持的挑战。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉基础模型在细粒度语义分割（如特定细胞亚型识别）中的不足，同时降低标注工作量。

Method: 采用全栈方法，包括分子驱动的标注、SAM适配器学习以及分子导向的校正学习（MOCL）来优化分割。

Result: 实验表明All-in-SAM显著提升了细胞分类性能，适应不同质量的标注数据。

Conclusion: 该方法减轻了标注负担，扩展了精准生物医学图像分析在资源有限环境中的应用，推动了医学诊断自动化。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Result: Waver在T2V和I2V排行榜上位列前三，优于现有开源模型，并与商业解决方案媲美。

Conclusion: Waver为高效训练高质量视频生成模型提供了技术支持，有望加速视频生成技术的进步。

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

<details>

Motivation: 现有的人体网格建模方法在捕捉多样姿势和形状的细节变化方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性不足和建模假设限制。

Method: ATLAS基于600k高分辨率扫描数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，并采用非线性姿态校正。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿势时表现更优，非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿势。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过解耦形状和骨骼基础，提供了更高的形状表达性和控制能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Conclusion: SceneGen为高质量3D内容生成提供了新解决方案，有望推动下游任务的实际应用。

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像编辑中存在全局去噪导致的不必要修改和指令遵循问题，而自回归模型通过序列化过程避免了这些问题。

Method: VAREdit将图像编辑重构为下一尺度预测问题，引入Scale-Aligned Reference（SAR）模块，通过尺度匹配的源图像特征指导目标特征生成。

Result: VAREdit在编辑准确性和效率上显著提升，GPT-Balance分数比领先的扩散方法高30%+，512×512编辑仅需1.2秒。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归框架和SAR模块，实现了高效且精确的图像编辑，优于现有扩散方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的群体推理方法，通过优化样本质量和多样性，解决了生成模型中独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 独立采样在生成模型中导致样本冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索，尤其是在需要多图像输出的应用中。

Method: 将群体推理建模为二次整数分配问题，通过图节点表示候选输出，优化质量和多样性，并采用渐进剪枝提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了群体多样性和质量，优于独立采样基线和其他推理算法。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种生成任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为连贯的群体而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Motivation: 现有视觉扩散模型因训练分辨率和计算资源限制，难以生成高质量的高分辨率图像或视频，且现有方法易产生重复模式。

Method: 提出CineScale，针对两种视频生成架构设计专用变体，支持高分辨率I2V和V2V合成。

Result: 实验验证了CineScale的优越性，支持8k图像生成和4k视频生成。

Conclusion: CineScale扩展了高分辨率视觉生成的能力，无需微调即可实现高质量生成。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过强化学习框架和奖励设计，显著提升了医学诊断的准确性和可解释性，为临床提供更可靠的初步诊断。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Result: 在真实机器人上验证了系统的实时控制性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险工业应用提供了成本低、安全且直观的解决方案。

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection

pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet

Motivation: 手术部位感染（SSI）是常见且高成本的医疗相关感染，但目前缺乏公开的手术伤口数据集和筛查工具。

Method: 提出SurgWound数据集和WoundQwen框架，包括三阶段学习：特征预测、诊断和报告生成。

Result: SurgWound包含697张手术伤口图像，WoundQwen能分析伤口特征并提供个性化护理建议。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理和及时干预提供了新工具，有望改善患者预后。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频流采用有损压缩和速率自适应技术，而新型神经形态事件传感器以异步像素采样记录视频，主要用于计算机视觉应用。目前研究主要集中在应用开发，忽略了数据传输这一关键问题。

Method: 调查了基于事件的视频系统现状，结合近期可扩展事件流工作，提出了一种基于Media Over QUIC协议草案的低延迟事件流格式。

Result: 提出了一种新的低延迟事件流格式，解决了事件传感器数据传输的技术问题。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了事件传感器数据传输领域的空白，为未来相关应用提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

Conclusion: 该方法无需配对数据，通过外部先验和残差学习显著提升了3D CT超分辨率重建效果。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision

significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,
trustworthy medical AI solutions.

TL;DR: DoSReMC是一种针对乳腺X光分类的批归一化适应框架，旨在提升跨域泛化能力，无需重新训练整个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在不同域数据上性能下降，限制了AI在临床中的安全公平部署。

Method: 通过仅微调批归一化和全连接层，保留预训练卷积滤波器，并结合对抗训练方案。

Result: 实验表明批归一化层是域依赖的主要来源，DoSReMC显著提升了跨域泛化性能。

Conclusion: DoSReMC为构建更稳健、可泛化的乳腺X光分类系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSIs）常受复杂噪声影响，现有深度展开方法缺乏收敛保证，而深度平衡（DEQ）模型能自然符合优化过程。

Method: 在DEQ框架下，结合2D和3D卷积稀疏表示，嵌入Transformer块利用非局部自相似性，并集成细节增强模块。

Result: 实验表明，DECSC方法在去噪性能上优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: DECSC框架有效统一了多种特征表示，提升了HSIs去噪的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，虚拟双能量减影图像的F1得分为85.59%，略低于真实图像的90.35%。

Conclusion: 虚拟双能量减影图像生成具有潜力，未来技术进步可能缩小与真实图像的差距，使其在临床中可行。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中，放射科医师之间的观察差异导致标签不确定性，尤其是在视觉解释主观性强的模态（如肺部超声）中。本文旨在通过捕捉放射科医师对标注区域的置信度，解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一种数据标注协议，记录放射科医师对每个标注区域的置信度，并在训练过程中利用这些置信度值。通过实验比较不同置信度阈值对模型性能的影响。

Result: 使用高置信度阈值（如60%）训练模型，显著提高了分割性能，并改善了临床关键任务（如S/F氧合比估计、分类和30天患者再入院预测）的表现。

Conclusion: 标签置信度是一个有价值的信号，合理利用可以显著提升AI在医学影像中的可靠性和临床实用性。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Motivation: 脑MRA图像中血管的精确分割对手术至关重要，但现有方法（如手动分割或Frangi滤波器）精度不足，且缺乏公开的标注数据集。

Method: HessNet是一种基于Hessian矩阵的轻量级神经网络，仅含6000参数，可在CPU上运行，适用于复杂结构（如管状结构）的分割。

Result: 在最小训练数据集上达到先进的分割精度，并基于IXI数据集创建了200张半手动标注的脑血管数据集。

Conclusion: HessNet提供高精度血管分割，减少专家标注负担，数据集已公开，有助于推动相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary

Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Method: 通过构建Side Effect Evaluation（SEE）评估基准，使用分层和组合提示来测试CETs的鲁棒性，并量化其对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄漏。

Conclusion: 结论是CETs存在显著局限性，未来需要更鲁棒的概念擦除方法。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了似然检测器在表示空间中的潜力，挑战了其在像素空间中表现不佳的观点。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Conclusion: Intern-S1通过算法、数据和训练系统的创新，填补了科学领域开源与闭源模型的差距，为AGI发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的生成对抗网络方法，用于从单次强度测量中重建相位和吸收信息，无需配对或模拟训练数据。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位恢复方法依赖特定近似或边界条件，且需要专家手动调整参数，限制了其适用性。

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

Conclusion: ADΔER表示法及其可视化工具为事件视频研究提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a
centralized repository at

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于图的ANNS已成为现代AI应用的主流方法，但现有研究多关注算法创新，忽视了内存布局对执行时间的显著影响。

Method: 通过图适配器将任意图拓扑转换为统一表示，并结合GPU优化的图遍历引擎，评估了多种重排序策略。

Result: 在保持搜索精度的前提下，GPU优化的重排序策略实现了高达15%的QPS提升。

Conclusion: 内存布局优化与现有算法创新正交，是提升性能的重要方向。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.
