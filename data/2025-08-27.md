### [1] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无需真实训练数据的水下3D物体检测方法，比较了基于物理模拟的合成数据训练神经网络和基于模板匹配的两种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D物体检测中训练数据稀缺和获取成本高的问题。

Method: 结合物理模拟生成合成数据训练神经网络，以及基于几何先验的模板匹配系统。

Result: 神经网络在模拟数据上表现优异（98% mAP），但在真实数据上下降至40%；模板匹配在真实数据上表现稳健（83% mAP）。

Conclusion: 挑战了深度学习在水下领域依赖大量数据的传统观念，为数据稀缺环境下的水下检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一种融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于高效、可解释的脑肿瘤MRI检测，显著提升了准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有脑肿瘤检测方法在通用性、计算效率、可解释性和透明度方面的不足。

Method: 采用MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流融合模型，结合GradCAM提供视觉解释，训练于6,020个MRI扫描的增强数据集。

Result: 训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835，比基线模型VGG19准确率提高3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一种高效、高性能且可解释的模型，有望成为临床实用的脑肿瘤检测工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态基础中存在系统性缺陷，尤其是在视觉参考下的事实回忆能力显著下降。通过内部状态探测，可以高精度识别不可靠响应，并提升选择性预测的覆盖率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在多模态基础中的表现，尤其是视觉与文本参考下的事实回忆能力差异，以揭示模型的内在缺陷。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较VLMs在文本和视觉参考下的表现，并利用内部状态探测技术识别不可靠响应。

Result: VLMs在视觉参考下的事实回忆能力下降50%，内部状态探测的准确率超过92%，选择性预测的覆盖率提升7.87%，错误率降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态基础中存在可检测的系统性缺陷，未来研究应关注如何改进视觉与知识的链接能力。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过优化语义逻辑和几何正则化显著提升了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏输入导致的辐射模糊和形状模糊是3D重建的主要挑战，需要更丰富的表示和正则化方法。

Method: 结合基于块的语义逻辑与符号距离场和辐射场进行联合优化，并引入几何基元掩码的正则化。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，稀疏重建方法的平均倒角距离显著降低（SparseNeuS减少44%，VolRecon减少20%），作为插件使用时误差降低69%（NeuS）和68%（Neuralangelo）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义增强和几何正则化有效解决了稀疏输入的重建问题，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法高效检测非法垃圾填埋场的方法，并在AerialWaste数据集上取得了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对环境和人类健康构成威胁，但手动检测效率低且资源消耗大，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet等轻量级模型训练，并通过集成和融合技术提升性能。

Result: 集成模型在AerialWaste数据集上实现了92.33%的准确率、92.67%的精确率等优异指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成技术可高效检测非法垃圾填埋场，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU框架通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，提升了多模态情感分析的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定结构依赖和语义不对齐问题，限制了性能。

Method: SSU动态构建模态特定图结构，引入语义锚点进行跨模态对齐，并采用多视图对比学习目标。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上，SSU实现了最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: SSU通过语义基础交互捕捉细微情感模式，具有高可解释性和性能优势。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速、姿势不变的框架，能从单张任意姿势的人脸图像生成3D高斯泼溅模型，速度快且保持身份特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D高斯泼溅模型时速度慢或无法保持身份特征，FastAvatar旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络设计，通过预测模板模型的残差实现快速拟合和身份保留。

Result: FastAvatar在重建质量和速度上显著优于现有方法，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar的高质量和快速性扩展了3D高斯泼溅模型在消费和交互系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种适用于人道主义和紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用生物特征模板保护（BTP）方案PolyProtect，验证了其在人脸和指纹识别中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道主义和紧急场景中，生物识别技术能提高效率，但也带来数据隐私风险，需要一种轻量级且安全的保护方案。

Method: 通过比较分析BTP方案，选择PolyProtect方法，并在真实数据集上评估其验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在人脸和指纹识别中表现良好，具备模块化和轻量计算的优势。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有前景的BTP方法，未来计划开源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 下一代视觉基础模型应引入动态关系图以增强推理能力，提升性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在需要显式推理实体、角色和时空关系的任务上存在局限性，而关系能力对细粒度任务至关重要。

Method: 通过轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块增强基础模型，动态构建关系图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了语义保真度、鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率，同时节省内存和硬件资源。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括动态图构建、多级关系推理、跨模态融合和结构化任务评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的数据集（LPLC数据集），用于解决自动车牌识别（ALPR）中低质量车牌（LP）的识别问题，并提出了分类任务基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低质量车牌识别是ALPR的主要挑战，现有方法如超分辨率（SR）未能完全解决这一问题。选择性图像预处理是优化模型性能和计算效率的关键。

Method: 引入包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌的数据集，采用细粒度标注策略，包括遮挡、四种可读性类别和字符标签。提出分类任务，使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种网络进行基准测试。

Result: 三种基线模型的F1分数均低于80%，表明任务难度大，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: LPLC数据集为低质量车牌识别研究提供了重要资源，实验结果强调了该领域的挑战性和未来研究的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专为皮肤病视觉问答设计的专家-通用框架，结合轻量级图像分类器和压缩的对话模型，显著提升诊断准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中潜力大，但存在诊断准确性不足和计算成本高的问题。

Method: CLARIFY结合专家（图像分类器）和通用（对话模型）组件，并通过知识图谱增强准确性。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，CLARIFY诊断准确性提升18%，计算资源需求降低20%。

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量、可信且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用范例。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合时空动态和语义上下文建模，无需训练时接触异常示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频中异常检测的挑战，因其不可预测和上下文依赖性。

Method: 混合架构结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP，使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，加入上下文门控机制。

Result: 系统能够泛化到复杂环境中未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理与语义上下文的空白。

Conclusion: 该框架在零样本异常检测中有效结合了时间推理和语义上下文，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at
https://github.com/NK-II/Context-Aware-ZeroShot-Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中表现不佳，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展。

Method: 通过跨模态标签转移，利用动态感知关联和歧义消除传播，将雷达数据生成的伪标签转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上，DoGFlow显著优于现有自监督方法，仅需10%标注数据即可达到90%全监督性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了自监督场景流估计的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一种基于卫星图像和粗略几何先验的3D建筑生成方法，解决了现有方法在缺乏几何指导或依赖高细节输入时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在仅依赖卫星图像时难以恢复准确建筑结构，或依赖高细节输入而无法从简单先验生成满意结果。

Method: 通过建模从插值噪声粗略先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活几何控制，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 开发了Skylines-50K数据集，包含50,000个独特风格化3D建筑资产，模型表现出色且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: SatSkylines在3D建筑生成中实现了高效几何控制，并通过大规模数据集支持详细模型生成。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检测游戏环境中可穿越空间过渡点（STP）的方法，并从中选择主STP（MSTP），通过两阶段深度学习流程实现，验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，玩家依赖视觉线索识别地图过渡点，这对自动地图生成和评估地图提示展示至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习流程：先用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，再用轻量级MSTP选择器结合局部和全局视觉特征进行排序。

Result: 实验表明，全网络微调在数据充足时表现更优，而仅使用适配器在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健。

Conclusion: 论文定义了新问题，提供了基线流程和数据集，为未来AI导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂影视制作中表现不足，需要更精细的角色互动和动态效果。

Method: 基于Wan构建的Wan-S2V模型，通过音频驱动实现角色动画。

Result: 实验表明，Wan-S2V在表现力和保真度上显著优于Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等现有模型。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V为电影级角色动画提供了更优解决方案，并适用于长视频生成和唇音同步编辑。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架（DeReF），通过随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，解决了现有方法在癌症生存分析中的固定融合和信息交互不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在癌症生存分析中面临固定融合方案导致模型依赖预定义特征组合，以及MoE融合中专家网络信息交互不足的挑战。

Method: DeReF框架包括随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，并结合区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和TCGA公共数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF通过增强特征组合多样性和信息交互，提升了癌症生存分析的性能。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个用于视频中去除物体及其副作用的框架，通过合成数据和扩散变换器实现高效去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理物体副作用（如阴影、反射等）时缺乏成对视频数据作为监督，ROSE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模成对数据集，并基于扩散变换器实现视频修复模型。

Result: ROSE在去除物体及其副作用方面表现优异，并能泛化到真实视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE通过系统性研究和合成数据解决了视频中物体副作用去除的挑战，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决视频字幕生成中运动与细节不平衡问题的方法，包括构建HMD-270K数据集和引入CSER优化策略，最终开发了OwlCap模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动与细节不平衡问题，导致字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：构建HMD-270K数据集，采用MDF和FGE两阶段流程；2) 优化层面：提出基于GRPO的CSER策略，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证提升字幕完整性。

Result: OwlCap模型在VDC和DREAM-1K基准测试中分别提升了4.2 Acc和4.6 F1。

Conclusion: HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型将公开发布，推动视频字幕生成研究的发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文拓片图像中的噪声和裂纹等退化因素限制了传统检测网络的有效性，需要一种新方法来增强特征提取。

Method: 利用甲骨文字体库数据集作为先验知识，通过聚类表示学习增强检测网络的特征提取，并设计专用损失函数优化特征表示。

Result: 在三种主流检测框架（Faster R-CNN、DETR和Sparse R-CNN）上实验，所有框架均表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚类表示学习和专用损失函数，有效提升了甲骨文拓片图像的检测性能，为数字考古提供了新思路。

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频率域SNR先验的Transformer方法（FAST和FAT），用于水下图像增强，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间域SNR先验方法在分离跨通道干扰和增强信息结构方面存在局限性。

Method: 在频率域使用SNR先验，结合FAST和FAT模块，通过U型架构整合RGB流和SNR引导分支。

Result: 在多个数据集上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，有效恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度。

Conclusion: 频率域SNR先验和Transformer结合的方法优于现有方法，为水下图像增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层时空分割网络（HSSN），通过结合局部细节建模和全局动态感知，提高超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割的准确性，从而改进射血分数（EF）估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在分割性能上表现良好，但在EF估计上效果不佳，因此需要一种能同时处理局部细节和全局动态的方法。

Method: 采用分层设计，低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像以保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系，并提出时空交叉扫描（STCS）模块以整合长程上下文。

Result: 通过平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免了局部误差累积或细节丢失的问题，有效减少了EF计算偏差。

Conclusion: HSSN网络在超声心动图视频中实现了更准确的EF估计，为心脏结构和功能评估提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域偏移导致模型性能下降，现有UDA方法依赖特征提取器微调，效率低且可解释性差。

Method: FPS框架冻结特征编码器，仅优化决策边界，利用预训练模型的特征空间几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）。

Result: FPS在多个公共基准测试中表现优异，适用于多模态大模型和多样化领域。

Conclusion: FPS为领域适应任务提供了一种简单、高效且通用的迁移学习范式。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上达到99.65%准确率，特征减少至7个，推理时间缩短。

Conclusion: 轻量级HAR系统适用于边缘设备，支持实时应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法满足复杂纹理和一致变形的需求。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives和Enhanced Deformation Model（EDM），分别通过动态锚点和可学习颜色参数增强颜色表达，以及结合时间感知基函数与时间无关变形来精确捕捉局部和全局变形。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和基准数据集（EndoNeRF、StereoMIS）上，ColorGS实现了PSNR 39.85（比现有3DGS方法高1.5）和SSIM 97.25%的优异性能，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS在手术场景重建中平衡了高保真与计算实用性，为术中导航和AR/VR应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 在不平衡数据集上训练神经网络时，模型倾向于偏向多数类，导致少数类的识别性能显著下降。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化技术，为每个类别分配特定的洪水水平，抑制多数类的过拟合，同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在图像分类任务中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统洪水正则化，提高了少数类的分类性能并实现了更好的整体泛化。

Conclusion: 类别的洪水正则化是一种有效的正则化方法，适用于不平衡数据集的训练。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Conclusion: ADM有效解决了平坦区域中的样本难度评估问题，结合CL与SAM提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [29] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了水下目标检测中性能差异的原因，重点关注扇贝类别的检测问题，提出了改进建议并公开了代码和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态系统监测至关重要，但存在图像质量差、类别分布不均和视觉特征独特等挑战，某些物种检测效果不佳的原因尚不明确。

Method: 通过操纵DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分为定位和分类两部分，使用YOLO11和TIDE分析扇贝类别的性能问题。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是主要问题；分类实验显示即使数据平衡，精度差距仍存在，表明特征内在挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回时使用平衡分布；改进低性能类别应聚焦于定位模块的算法优化。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 传统工业流程从2D工程图开始，但现有方法主要关注点云、网格或文本输入，忽略了这一关键步骤。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架，包括网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器Transformer架构和软目标分布损失函数。

Result: 创建了CAD-VGDrawing数据集，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Drawing2CAD填补了从2D工程图生成参数化CAD模型的空白，为工业设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于路由门控的跨模态特征融合方法，用于自适应调整音频和视觉特征的权重，以提升噪声环境下的音频-视觉语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致在噪声环境中的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用路由门控机制，基于令牌级声学损坏分数动态调整音频和视觉特征的权重，并通过门控跨注意力增强视觉线索。

Result: 在LRS3数据集上，相比AV-HuBERT，词错误率相对降低了16.51-42.67%。

Conclusion: 路由门控机制和门控跨注意力显著提升了模型在真实噪声环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的基准测试，将HOI检测重新定义为多答案多选题任务，以避免对有效预测的惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI基准测试与现代VLMs不兼容，且评估协议要求与标注类别完全匹配，导致有效预测被错误惩罚。

Method: 引入新的基准测试，将HOI检测改为多答案多选题任务，包括真实正选项和精心设计的负选项以减少歧义。

Result: 新基准测试首次实现了VLMs和HOI方法的直接比较，为HOI理解提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 新基准测试解决了现有评估协议的局限性，为HOI检测领域提供了更公平和全面的评估方式。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多选题生成方法主要关注文本选项，忽视了视觉选项，且高质量干扰项生成成本高、扩展性差。

Method: 提出CmOS框架，结合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块。

Result: 实验表明，CmOS在内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同学科和教育水平。

Conclusion: CmOS为多选题生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于需要视觉选项的教育场景。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Result: 首次实现无需真实地图的在线地图模型训练，并能利用大规模无标注数据进行半监督预训练。

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer为在线地图训练提供了高效且低成本的新方法。

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at
github.com/boschresearch/PseudoMapTrainer.

Conclusion: 研究为社区提供了严格基准、高效标注流程和系统评估，推动了废物检测领域的进展。

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 字体形状与印象标签之间存在紧密关系，但传统词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）无法有效捕捉这种关系。

Method: 构建印象标签的共现关系图，应用谱嵌入技术生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法优于BERT和CLIP，尤其在印象引导的字体生成任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为印象标签的嵌入提供了新思路，适用于字体生成和检索任务。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Motivation: 传统NFI依赖人工现场调查，耗时耗力。结合遥感和机器学习可以更高效地更新NFI数据，但现有方法主要依赖随机森林分类器和手工设计的特征，限制了分类精度。

Method: 研究利用Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5和SRTM卫星数据，通过Google Earth Engine提取时间序列数据，并微调预训练的遥感时间序列基础模型。

Conclusion: 深度学习特征在数据有限的任务中表现优异，结合公开卫星数据和预训练模型，可以显著提升NFI分类精度，补充现有森林资源调查流程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Result: 在八个医疗影像数据集上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅需3.6M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过多模态联合去偏和对齐，显著提升了医疗诊断的公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

*Zhehao Li,Chong Wang,Yi Chen,Yinghao Lu,Jiangbo Qian,Jiong Wang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双查询增强网络（DQEN），通过增强对象和交互查询，提升了基于DETR的HOI检测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DETR的HOI检测模型依赖随机初始化的查询，导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。

Method: 设计了对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，并引入交互语义融合模块和辅助预测单元。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: DQEN通过增强查询表示，显著提升了HOI检测的准确性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度神经网络的非线性决策边界难以理解，自动驾驶中的AI决策缺乏可解释性，影响了其广泛部署。

Method: 设计了损失函数以生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，从而提升模型的可解释性，并通过特征激活解释图像区域对控制命令的贡献。

Result: 在CARLA基准测试中，该方法不仅提高了可解释性，还减少了违规行为，实现了更高的路线完成率和更低的违规分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证可解释性的同时，超越了CARLA排行榜上的顶级方法，为自动驾驶提供了更安全、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务多关注表面识别，忽略事件的上下文和语义维度，EVENTA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于OpenEvents V1数据集，设置两个赛道：事件增强的图像检索与描述、基于事件的图像检索，45支团队参与。

Result: 通过公开和私有测试评估，前三名团队在ACM Multimedia 2025展示解决方案。

Conclusion: EVENTA为上下文感知、叙事驱动的多媒体AI奠定基础，适用于新闻、媒体分析等领域。

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析群体和单个行人在空间利用和行为模式上的差异，为行人模拟和空间设计验证提供基础。

Method: 通过分割行人轨迹为固定时间窗口，应用基于Transformer的配对分类模型，并结合空间和行为维度的综合指标框架。

Result: 研究建立了分类流程和数据集结构，为不同序列长度的分析奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 未来版本将进一步完善定量分析，以支持人群动力学研究中的行人模拟和空间设计验证。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Motivation: 解决大范围珊瑚礁监测中高分辨率分类的挑战，同时降低标注成本。

Result: 实现了珊瑚形态的大范围分割，并展示了新类别的灵活性。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的高分辨率珊瑚礁监测方法。

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了生成式AI在制图中的潜力，并提出了进一步技术改进和制图师新角色的方向。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将风格驱动和主题驱动生成视为对立任务，但两者本质都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组。

Method: 构建大规模三元组数据集，引入解耦学习方案（风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练），并结合风格奖励学习范式（SRL）。

Result: USO在开源模型中实现了主题一致性和风格相似性的最先进性能。

Conclusion: USO通过统一框架解决了风格与主题的对抗问题，并发布了首个联合评估基准USO-Bench。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估NeRF隐私保护的新协议，并开发了ppNeSF，一种基于分割监督的NeRF变体，以保护隐私的同时实现高精度视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在视觉定位中广泛应用，但其编码的精细场景细节可能泄露隐私信息，需解决隐私保护问题。

Method: 提出评估NeRF隐私保护的协议，并设计ppNeSF，通过分割监督训练，避免存储敏感细节。

Result: ppNeSF在保护隐私的同时，实现了高精度的视觉定位，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ppNeSF有效平衡了隐私保护与定位精度，为云服务中的视觉定位提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG improves Document VQA by selectively retrieving relevant segments, boosting accuracy without memory-heavy concatenation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Document VQA systems are memory-intensive, either concatenating all pages or using large models. RAG offers a more efficient alternative.

Method: Evaluated text-based and visual retrieval variants of RAG across multiple models and benchmarks (MP-DocVQA, DUDE, InfographicVQA).

Result: Text-based retrieval improved baseline by +22.5 ANLS; visual retrieval by +5.0 ANLS without OCR. Retrieval and reranking were key, while layout-guided chunking failed.

Conclusion: Careful evidence selection via RAG consistently enhances accuracy in Document VQA, proving its practical value.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Result: 评估显示VLMs存在显著偏见，表现最佳的模型GRAS Bias Score仅为2/100。

Conclusion: GRAS为评估和量化VLMs的偏见提供了重要工具，并揭示了VQA评估中的方法论问题。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中存在三个问题：非端到端、边缘特征判别性低、几何约束不足。

Method: 提出RoofSeg网络，采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，结合Edge-Aware Mask Module（EAMM）和自适应权重策略，增强边缘判别性和几何约束。

Result: RoofSeg在端到端分割中表现更优，边缘分割精度提升。

Conclusion: RoofSeg通过结合几何先验和自适应策略，显著提升了屋顶平面分割的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Motivation: 微塑料污染日益严重，对人体健康构成威胁，但目前缺乏高效的检测方法。

Method: 采用尼罗红染色荧光显微镜和卷积神经网络（CNN）进行微塑料的定位和计数。

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色荧光血液图像数据集上，MDN的准确率为92%，IoU为87.4%，F1分数为92.1%。

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测中表现出色，为未来应用于人体样本提供了可能性。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Motivation: 现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在PRVR领域尚未充分探索。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越先前模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统化架构改进CLIP，为PRVR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Conclusion: 几何表示学习可有效解决数据稀缺问题，提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力的评估效果。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在工业需求的高性能、效率和适应性方面表现不足，且难以适应多样化的数据标注场景。

Method: 基于SimpleNet，引入合成异常生成、增强分类头和改进学习过程，支持四种监督场景。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，推理时间低于10毫秒。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet在统一多样化监督范式的同时保持速度和可靠性，是解决实际制造挑战的重要进展。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过旋转不平衡质量块诱导周期性振动，以持续生成事件，并结合运动补偿管道，为下游感知任务提供干净的事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在静态或低运动场景中，固定安装的事件相机无法生成事件，限制了其应用。现有方法需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 采用旋转不平衡质量块诱导周期性振动，结合运动补偿管道去除注入的运动，生成干净的事件数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠恢复运动参数，并在图像重建和边缘检测方面优于无运动诱导的事件传感。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单硬件实现了持续事件生成，提升了事件相机在静态场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级UNet++结合拓扑感知损失的方法，用于历史文档的文本行分割，显著提高了数据效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高且专家知识稀缺，因此研究少样本学习方法以减少数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++模型和拓扑感知损失函数，通过小样本训练（仅三页标注数据）提高分割效果。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，识别准确率提升200%，行交并比提升75%，并在DIVA-HisDB任务中达到或超过基线检测任务的F-Measure分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在少样本条件下显著提升了历史文档文本行分割的性能，证明了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法增强单目3D视觉定位任务中文本嵌入的3D感知能力，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感，导致3D理解能力弱，影响定位性能。

Method: 提出3D文本增强（3DTE）和文本引导几何增强（TGE）模块，优化文本嵌入和几何特征。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得显著提升，远距离场景准确率提高11.94%。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [64] [Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167)
*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码方法（WEF-PE），用于改进视觉Transformer在图像任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法缺乏几何约束，无法有效利用图像的空间邻近性先验。

Method: 通过椭圆函数的自然复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用其双周期性和非线性几何特性编码空间距离关系。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，如ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100上达到63.78%的准确率，ViT-Base达到93.28%。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理改进了位置编码，增强了模型的几何归纳偏置和语义聚焦能力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的网格生成框架，通过分别处理顶点和面来减少冗余，显著提升生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因顶点重复使用导致序列过长和生成效率低下，需改进。

Method: 分别用自回归模型生成顶点和双向Transformer构建面，引入保真增强器和后处理框架。

Result: 生成速度提升8倍以上，网格质量更高。

Conclusion: 新框架在效率和生成质量上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在图像属性操作中参数冗余和灵活性不足的问题，提升多属性控制的效率和扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在属性操作上具有高准确性和扩展性，优于现有方法，并能应用于真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider为图像属性操作提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Motivation: 现有神经重建方法受限于静态环境和有限场景控制，而图像或视频扩散模型缺乏几何基础和因果性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 能够生成几何准确、纹理逼真的3D驾驶场景，支持基于地图布局的条件生成。

Conclusion: 该方法在可控性和几何一致性方面表现出色，适用于复杂驾驶场景的生成。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Motivation: 现有视频角色模型仅能生成物理上逼真的动画，但缺乏对情感、意图或上下文语义的捕捉。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成结构化文本条件，结合新型Multimodal DiT架构和Pseudo Last Frame设计。

Result: 在多项指标上表现领先，包括唇同步精度、视频质量、动作自然度和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成语义连贯且表现力强的动画，适用于复杂场景和多角色情况。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Motivation: 现有方法仅提供静态分析或需要手动初始化，缺乏连续的单颗粒轨迹分解，限制了CNT动态生长的表征。

Method: VFTrack结合手工或深度特征检测器和匹配器，实现CNT微柱生长的运动学分析。

Result: 使用13,540条手动标注轨迹验证，ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器组合表现最佳（F1分数0.78，α分数0.89）。

Conclusion: VFTrack通过分解运动向量，支持异质区域生长速率计算和CNT柱形态重建，推动纳米材料自动表征的发展。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分割模型在无提示分割任务上表现分散，需要统一架构来处理提示和无提示分割。

Method: 采用状态空间模型，固定空间状态，并行训练框架，实现高效长视频处理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，训练速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: AUSM为视频分割提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Result: Style4D在4D风格化中表现优异，生成细节丰富且时空一致的渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的重要资源。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过分解问题为两步：生成目标图像并优化网格对齐，引入自注意力重连机制（RSActrl）和关键点对应，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制调整3D资产姿态仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 使用图像生成器生成目标图像；2. 通过多视角姿态优化对齐网格；引入RSActrl机制和关键点对应。

Result: 在多样3D对象和自由文本提示下成功调整姿态，保持网格原始身份；用户研究中85%偏好该方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D通过语言控制有效调整3D姿态，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的方法，通过在3D潜在空间中进行精确和连贯的编辑，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D局部编辑在游戏产业和机器人交互中至关重要，但现有方法在保留未编辑区域和整体一致性方面存在挑战。

Method: VoxHammer通过预测反转轨迹并替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的连贯重建和编辑部分的整合。

Result: 实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VoxHammer为高质量编辑配对数据的合成提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

TL;DR: EMind是一个电磁信号基础模型，通过大规模预训练和独特模态特性，解决了电磁信号处理中的异构性、噪声和多任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号在动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域至关重要，但现有方法因信号异构性、噪声和任务多样性而受限。

Method: 构建了首个统一的大规模标准化电磁信号数据集，并设计了长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中表现出色，实现了从任务特定模型到统一框架的转变。

Conclusion: EMind为电磁信号处理提供了一个高效、通用的多任务学习框架。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文研究了光学透视增强现实（OST-AR）系统中目标透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知和系统可用性的影响，发现不透明目标和实时工具遮挡对精度和用户体验至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OST-AR系统（如HoloLens 2）在近距离任务（如手术）中深度感知和工具遮挡的挑战。

Method: 通过两个实验（深度匹配任务和模拟手术任务）比较不同目标透明度和工具可视化模式（虚拟工具、真实工具或无跟踪）的效果。

Result: 不透明目标显著降低深度误差；实时工具遮挡提供最高精度和可用性；高透明度目标略微损害深度感知。

Conclusion: 设计近距离AR系统时应优先考虑工具跟踪和遮挡处理，透明度的使用需谨慎权衡深度感知和工具可见性。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中病变分析因患者人口统计学、扫描仪厂商和专家标注的差异而高度可变，现有方法缺乏泛化能力且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 开发了一个协作框架，利用来自14个模拟医疗中心的2031项研究数据，采用FedAvg模型进行知识共享。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上表现优异（DSC为0.71±0.24），优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法，并展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在卒中病变分割中表现出色，尤其在分布外中心无需额外训练即可实现可靠性能。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接从传感器RAW数据恢复照片级真实图像的端到端扩散模型，解决了现有sRGB域扩散模型在高保真和真实生成之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型处理有损sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像的可访问性，导致性能不佳。RDDM直接在RAW域恢复图像，避免了传统两阶段ISP+IR流程的限制。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优潜在表示，以及可微分后色调处理（PTP）模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化。通过合成RAW LQ-HQ对进行大规模训练，并开发多拜耳（CMB）LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: RDDM在实验中优于现有sRGB扩散方法，生成更高保真且更少伪影的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域处理图像，显著提升了图像恢复的保真度和真实感。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Motivation: Transformer模型在分布内数据上表现良好，但在分布外数据上性能下降，需要一种方法来检测和增强其可靠性。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer编码器预训练，结合卷积解码器进行分割，并通过随机森林分类器检测分布外数据。

Result: RF-Deep在多个分布外数据集上表现优异，FPR95显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: RF-Deep是一种简单有效的方法，可提升癌症分割模型在分布内外数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为人工和生物神经系统的信息流提供了可推广且可解释的分析方法。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape
based on a quantum art theme.

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

*Weide Liu,Xiaoyang Zhong,Lu Wang,Jingwen Hou,Yuemei Luo,Jiebin Yan,Yuming Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多尺度特征提取和不确定性估计的无监督域自适应方法，用于时间序列数据，显著提升了目标域的性能和预测置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据中训练和测试数据集之间的分布偏移是一个常见挑战，现有方法在泛化和鲁棒性方面存在不足。

Method: 采用多尺度混合输入架构捕获不同尺度的特征，并引入基于证据学习的不确定性感知机制，通过Dirichlet先验促进目标预测和不确定性估计。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且具有更低的预期校准误差（ECE）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度特征和不确定性估计有效提升了无监督域自适应的性能，适用于时间序列数据。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合统计物理、编码理论和代数拓扑的统一框架，用于高效多类图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过物理启发的嵌入和拓扑引导的图设计，实现高维特征向量的高效压缩和分类。

Method: 将高维特征向量解释为稀疏MET-QC-LDPC图上的自旋，形成RBIM模型，并在Nishimori温度下操作，利用拓扑不变量优化图设计。

Result: 在ImageNet-10和ImageNet-100上分别达到98.7%和82.7%的准确率，压缩比达40倍。

Conclusion: 拓扑引导的图设计能够实现高效且高性能的物理启发嵌入。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT是一种高效的去偏框架，通过软掩码权重微调，仅需少量外部数据和少量微调轮次即可提升模型公平性，同时保持判别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在现实场景中可能表现出偏见，影响公平性和泛化能力，现有去偏方法通常需要原始训练数据和大量重新训练，且存在公平性与性能的权衡。

Method: SWiFT通过分析模型参数对偏见和预测性能的贡献，采用两步微调过程，对不同参数定义不同的梯度流。

Result: 在多个数据集和敏感属性上的实验表明，SWiFT能显著减少模型偏见，同时保持或提升诊断准确性，并表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够在提升模型公平性的同时保持其性能，适用于医疗等敏感领域。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conclusion: C-Flat和C-Flat++为持续学习提供了高效且兼容性强的解决方案，显著提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PAF-KIP的方法，用于解决开放集测试时适应（OSTTA）中的问题，通过主辅助过滤和知识集成预测提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集数据，传统方法依赖源模型过滤效果不佳，且适应模型不稳定导致误差累积。

Method: 提出主辅助过滤（PAF）验证数据，并设计知识集成预测（KIP）整合源模型、适应模型和EMA模型的互补知识。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证，PAF-KIP在封闭集准确率和开放集判别能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAF-KIP有效解决了OSTTA中的问题，提升了模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Motivation: 现有单次方法无法在单次生成中可控地混合多个运动，限制了动画师的可控性。

Result: 在多种动画风格和骨架结构上验证，生成合理、平滑且可控的运动混合。

Conclusion: 方法高效统一，为动画师提供了灵活可控的运动混合工具。

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff通过结合语义和建筑约束，实现了高质量且实用的3D室内场景合成。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Result: PanoHair能在5秒内生成干净的流形网格，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanoHair提供了一种高效、高质量的头发合成方案，适用于数字人创建。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其渲染速度较慢，限制了实际应用。

Method: 改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、预训练卷积神经网络用于填补空洞，以及将点建模为高斯分布。

Conclusion: 这些优化方法不仅适用于INPC，还能广泛应用于其他类似技术，显著提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在增加VLM输出长度时往往引入无关内容，影响隐蔽性，因此需要一种更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 提出一种复合损失函数，平衡语义保留、重复特殊标记诱导和抑制结束标记（EOS），并通过动态加权策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，Hidden Tail将输出长度提升至19.2倍，达到最大标记限制，同时保持隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升VLM对抗效率导向威胁的鲁棒性的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF

advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务通常具有非马尔可夫性，而现有视觉语言动作（VLA）模型往往忽略时间上下文，导致在长时程任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出MemoryVLA框架，结合工作记忆和长期记忆机制，通过预训练的VLM编码观察信息，并使用记忆库存储和检索相关细节，最终通过扩散动作专家生成动作序列。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中，MemoryVLA均优于现有基线，最高提升26%的成功率。

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制，有效解决了长时程机器人操作任务中的时间依赖性问题。

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:
