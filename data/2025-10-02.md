### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的光谱-空间解混融合模块（SSUF）和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱图像超分辨率重建性能，在保持光谱保真度的同时提高空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度，这限制了其性能表现。

Method: 提出了SSUF模块，结合光谱解混与光谱-空间特征提取，引导基于ResNet的卷积神经网络进行改进重建；同时设计了空间-光谱梯度损失函数，整合均方误差与空间和光谱梯度分量。

Result: 在三个公开遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在保持竞争力的同时降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数有效提升了高光谱超分辨率重建的性能，实现了空间分辨率和光谱完整性的平衡改进。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织的方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言和视觉模型的广泛应用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，但当前对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，现有解决方案往往只解决表面症状而非根本原因。

Method: 提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织的方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式，为开发更鲁棒的解决方案提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，该研究为开发现实世界生成式AI系统中更有效和可推广的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RobustVLA方法，针对视觉-语言-动作模型的多模态扰动问题，通过输出鲁棒性优化和输入鲁棒性增强，显著提升了模型在真实世界扰动下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要关注简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动。研究发现动作模态最为脆弱，且现有视觉鲁棒性方法无法提升其他模态的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 输出鲁棒性：采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声；2. 输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持任务语义一致的动作；3. 多臂赌博机框架自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在pi0骨干上提升12.6%，OpenVLA骨干上提升10.4%，推理速度提升50.6倍，混合扰动下提升10.4%。在FR5机器人上提升65.6%。

Conclusion: RobustVLA能有效应对多模态扰动，特别在真实机器人场景中表现优异，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC通过能力分析而非任务启发式方法，仅用5%数据即可超越全数据训练效果，将指令调优转变为可控的能力驱动过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视内在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降

Method: CADC框架：无监督发现内在能力→基于影响力估计数据归因→能力感知课程设计（平衡选择和分阶段排序）

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准上超越全数据训练

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，涵盖三个难度递增的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，且缺少跨语言任务，使用真实世界图像（每张图像通常只包含一种文化）使得测试相对容易。

Method: 构建基于漫画的跨文化基准测试C³B，包含三个难度递增的任务：基础视觉识别、文化冲突理解、文化内容生成。

Result: 对11个开源MLLMs进行评估，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战，鼓励未来研究提升MLLMs的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了六种最先进的文本到图像模型在医疗职业性别表示中的系统性偏见，发现所有模型都表现出职业刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意应用中如何嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是医疗职业中的性别刻板印象。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示词，为五种医院相关职业（心脏病专家、医院主任、护士、护理人员、外科医生）和五种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析六种开放权重模型的性别表示。

Result: 所有模型都系统性地将护士表现为女性，外科医生表现为男性；不同模型存在显著差异：Qwen-Image和SDXL强制执行男性主导，FLUX.1-dev在大多数角色中偏向女性；肖像修饰词进一步调节性别平衡。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见既是系统性的又是模型特定的，提示词措辞在塑造人口统计结果中起着关键作用，需要偏差感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复出提示词模板，攻击成本仅为现有基线的13%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型促进了提示词交易市场的繁荣，但提示词本身存在被窃取的安全风险，这种风险尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将模板窃取问题建模为序列决策问题，使用基于相似度的多反馈信号作为奖励函数，在提示词空间中进行有效探索。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得最优性能，攻击成本大幅降低，且能够有效泛化到不同图像风格来窃取未见过的提示词模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中存在的紧急安全威胁，为MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过反事实测试验证视觉语言模型生成的自然语言解释的忠实性，发现模型解释往往听起来合理但不反映真实因果因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的自然语言解释听起来有说服力，但可能与实际驱动预测的因果因素不匹配，这种合理性与忠实性的错位带来技术和治理风险。

Method: 引入EDCT验证流程：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上测试，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT方法能有效检测VLM解释的忠实性问题，为模型可解释性评估提供了自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型框架，通过分层解耦方法解决高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，显著提升视觉理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，传统观点认为是小物体识别问题，但本文发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰而非物体大小。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token识别关键信息；2）Layout-Preserving Decoupling从背景中分离目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到SOTA，Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别达到92.1%和91.6%的V*Bench得分，超越RL方法，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe证明背景干扰是MLLMs高分辨率图像理解的主要瓶颈，提出的训练免费框架能有效提升性能，为MLLMs的视觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过空间和频域双域协同处理，有效解决遥感图像分割中的语义边缘模糊问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息提升分割精度。

Method: 结合空间处理方法和频域分析：1）使用FFT提取全局频域信息增强灰度变化下的全局表征能力；2）利用Haar小波变换分解高低频特征，利用其对边缘信息的不同敏感性优化边界分割；3）实现空间粒度与频域边缘敏感性的双域协同。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个主流数据集上均达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过有效的双域信息融合，显著提升了边界区域和灰度过渡带的分割精度，为遥感图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

TL;DR: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务构建为下一个路径点预测问题，提出Max-V1单阶段端到端框架，在nuScenes数据集上实现SOTA性能，提升超过30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶系统通常采用模块化设计，存在误差累积问题。本文旨在通过将驾驶任务重新定义为语言建模问题，实现更直接、更高效的端到端轨迹规划

Method: 提出Max-V1框架，利用VLM的生成能力直接从前置摄像头输入进行端到端轨迹预测。采用基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，相比先前基线整体提升超过30%。在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能，展示了跨车辆鲁棒性和适应性

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了将自动驾驶重新概念化为语言建模问题的有效性，代码将在发表后提供

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的设计空间探索方法和框架，用于压缩卷积神经网络，解决了低秩分解技术面临的挑战，包括最优秩选择、设计空间大、微调时间长等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩分解技术在压缩深度神经网络时面临多个挑战：最优秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间过长，以及不同层类型和分解方法的兼容性有限。

Method: 1. 基于特征图相似性的新颖秩选择策略；2. 一次性微调过程；3. 集成6种不同的LRF技术（卷积层3种，全连接层3种）；4. 支持所有类型的卷积层和全连接层；5. 集成到TensorFlow 2.x中。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果，精度损失最小，优于多种最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端设计空间探索框架有效解决了低秩分解技术的多个挑战，通过组合多种LRF方法实现了更好的压缩效果，为不同场景下的LRF技术应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在One-Image Guides（结合文本、图像和符号的视觉格式）理解方面的评估不足，这种格式体现了人类感知和理解的特点。

Method: 开发了半自动标注流水线，多个智能代理协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人工构建图像-文本对，并评估了29个最先进的MLLMs。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B表现最佳，总体准确率为77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面存在明显弱点。多代理标注系统在图像描述生成方面优于所有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在准确解释复杂视觉-文本关系方面仍有困难，提出的多代理标注系统具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Motivation: 传统地理空间建模主要依赖领域预训练和监督微调，缺乏推理能力。Geo-R1旨在将地理空间建模从领域预训练/监督微调扩展到推理优先的后训练。

Method: 1. 脚手架阶段：通过监督微调在合成思维链示例上灌输"地理空间思维范式"，将视觉线索与地理先验连接。2. 提升阶段：使用基于GRPO的强化学习在弱监督跨视图配对代理上进行训练，提供可验证和可扩展的奖励信号。

Result: Geo-R1在各种地理空间推理基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Geo-R1成功扩展了地理空间建模的范围，实现了推理优先的后训练方法，为地理空间AI应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元指标（USN）的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，并引入Wasserstein距离损失来优化剪枝过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 提出的USN指标和基于USN的剪枝方法有效解决了神经网络过参数化问题，提高了模型对语义变换扰动的鲁棒性认证能力，同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Motivation: 高光谱异常检测面临复杂真实环境挑战和先验知识有限的限制，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出传输理论模型，将像素视为模板形变观测，在SCDT域使用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型，检测偏离模型的异常信号。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于传输理论的SCDT域建模方法为高光谱异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，在复杂环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了MOLM水印框架，通过LoRA适配器实现生成模型的参数扰动，解决了现有水印方法脆弱、易被移除和更新成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了对检测合成图像和溯源能力的担忧。现有水印方法对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且水印密钥更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的关键依赖扰动，提出基于路由的MOLM方法，使用二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，对失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和黑盒对抗攻击具有鲁棒的关键恢复能力。

Conclusion: MOLM框架避免了密钥特定的重新训练，实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知与未知类之间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知召回率下降和已知类准确率降低。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（通过最大化子模条件增益函数选择与已知对象显著不同的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标联合解耦已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类间的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上的已知类准确率分别提升2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法，有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和遗忘问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ExpDWT-VAE的创新方法，通过离散小波变换增强VAE的潜在空间表示，专门针对卫星图像设计，以改进潜在扩散模型在遥感应用中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多研究改进潜在扩散模型，但针对其内在潜在空间改进的研究仍然稀缺。特别是在遥感应用中，像素空间扩散的计算复杂度较高，而潜在扩散模型通过在变分自编码器构建的压缩潜在空间中操作来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出的ExpDWT-VAE方法采用双分支结构：一个分支通过卷积操作处理空间域输入，另一个分支通过2D Haar小波分解、卷积操作和逆DWT重构提取和处理频域特征。两个分支合并创建集成的空间-频率表示，然后通过卷积和对角高斯映射进一步细化为鲁棒的潜在表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个性能指标上都能有效增强潜在空间表示，使用TerraFly地图系统提供的新卫星图像数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ExpDWT-VAE通过引入频域特征处理，成功提升了VAE潜在空间表示的质量，为遥感图像处理中的潜在扩散模型提供了更有效的潜在空间基础。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想观测历史，忽略了第一人称视觉中的感知伪影（遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致训练假设与部署现实脱节，限制了模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将历史特征融入预测解码器。

Result: BiFlow实现最先进性能，minADE和minFDE平均降低10-15%，展现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EgoTraj-Bench基准和BiFlow模型为开发真正适应现实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Motivation: 准确解读胸部X光片是医学影像中的关键任务，需要探索自动化方法的有效性，特别是比较传统监督学习与新兴零样本方法的性能差异。

Method: 在两个诊断任务（肺炎检测和结核病检测）上对比监督CNN和BiomedCLIP VLM的性能，重点研究决策阈值校准对零样本VLM性能的影响。

Result: 校准后，BiomedCLIP在肺炎检测任务上F1分数达到0.8841（超过CNN的0.8803），在结核病检测任务上从0.4812提升到0.7684，接近CNN的0.7834。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于释放零样本VLMs的诊断潜力至关重要，使其能够匹配甚至超越高效的任务特定监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

Motivation: 当前自监督去噪方法存在两个问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及在拟合高频时网络会学习到噪声图像中的高频噪声

Method: 1. 频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2. 使用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核对高频噪声的学习能力；3. 提出频谱分离和低秩重建模块（SSR模块）分离噪声和高频细节

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制优化了自监督去噪性能，成功解决了高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Result: 在多种分布偏移（包括风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均有效，相比零样本和TTA基线有持续改进。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能够有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在域偏移下的性能，通过提议重叠和提示选择策略实现了稳定的改进。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个用于视觉符号组合推理的基准测试，通过移动火柴棒修正错误算式，结合视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在视觉和符号组合推理方面存在不足，需要建立更严格的测试基准来评估和推进模型能力。

Method: 构建包含140万生成实例的基准数据集，涵盖文本引导和纯视觉设置，系统考虑数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现显著局限性：闭源模型仅能处理简单情况，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进视觉和符号组合推理提供了严谨的测试平台，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种更实用的异常检测方法NAGL，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了真实场景中可用的异常样本包含的宝贵信息。

Method: NAGL框架包含两个关键组件：残差挖掘（RM）从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，异常特征学习（AFL）通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的GAD方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，实现了更准确高效的跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来改进稀疏线性系统求解中的迭代方法选择，相比传统图像选择方法速度提升5.86%-11.50%，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像选择方法中，特征提取技术可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择相同的方法而性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAF特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示的相对特征与对应数值的绝对特征，获得全面的矩阵表示以避免特征歧义。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止不同矩阵间的特征歧义，提高了选择准确性，释放了图像选择方法的潜力，实现了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散生成模型的手部姿态优化方法，通过利用大视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导被遮挡区域的手部姿态重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时的3D手部姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如affordance）解决模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，通过VLM推断的HOI文本描述来指导被遮挡区域的姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在严重遮挡情况下显著优于现有回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化方法。

Conclusion: affordance引导的生成先验能够有效提升被遮挡手部姿态估计的准确性和功能一致性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法通过压缩视觉token来提高多模态大模型效率，但忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动会增加模型学习难度，导致参数空间难以快速适应。

Method: 提出渐进式一致性蒸馏框架(EPIC)，将token压缩引入的特征空间扰动分解为token维度和层维度，分别设计token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导并遵循渐进学习轨迹。

Result: 大量实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进式一致性蒸馏成功解决了token压缩带来的训练难度问题，显著提升了多模态大模型的效率。

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图存在噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准化测试套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供实用指导，通过发布预处理、分割和评估流程促进标准化评估。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节引起的姿态模糊性，而现有的概率方法仅限于单阶段估计，无法进行细化。

Method: 采用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段是联合扩散模型，采样多样的3D关节假设；第二阶段是网格潜在扩散模型，在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，并有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合概率建模与级联细化，成功解决了3D手部姿态重建中的模糊性和不确定性建模问题，提升了重建精度。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上的大量实验表明，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在检测微小、遮挡害虫方面表现出显著改进，明显优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架通过针对林业遥感特点的专门优化，有效解决了小目标检测中的关键挑战，为复杂林业环境中的害虫检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统霉菌菌落计数方法依赖大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在探索是否必须进行大量标注才能解决新的视觉任务。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景。比较了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在任务特定指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO模型仅使用150张图像微调就能达到与大量训练的YoloV9模型相近的性能，使用25张图像时仍能在约70%样本上保持可靠性能。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能以传统方法所需数据的一小部分达到相同效果，为自动化微生物系统开发提供了更快迭代和更高性能上限的解决方案。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Motivation: 现有的MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务学习向多任务学习过渡时存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE框架中设计自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家共同归一化门控权重；通过增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中的广泛实验表明，ASE在不同配置下都能持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL方法中的知识共享和过渡效率问题，为多任务学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: 该工作为视频帧插值提供了更灵活和通用的解决方案，能够适应各种插值需求，在视频生成应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息直接集成到原始NeRF管道中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 1. 多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示；2. 动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成；3. 多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终视图；4. 支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移。

Conclusion: 该方法重新设计了NeRF管道专门用于风格化，通过创新的动态风格注入和多级特征处理，实现了优于现有方法的3D风格迁移效果。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型，结合语义模式匹配模块和迭代自问精炼机制，使用领域特定优化提示和递归验证过程。

Result: 在缺陷与非缺陷图像区分上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类平衡设置），在类不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共识的在线特征增强策略（COFA），通过交替使用前景和背景特征来提升视觉语言导航（VLN）代理的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉语言导航中，前景区域提供语义线索，背景区域包含空间连接信息，但这两者的重要性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用语义增强的地标识别来分离前景和背景作为候选增强特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略，让代理根据不同的指令和导航位置整合两阶段投票结果来选择特征偏好。

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上的实验表明，该在线前景-背景增强方法提升了基线的泛化能力，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过交替使用前景和背景特征，并结合共识驱动的在线增强策略，可以有效提升视觉语言导航代理的泛化能力和导航性能。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [43] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR是一种新的视觉识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知的建模分离，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，从而同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，分离对象中心和上下文感知的建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。该方法不需要微调即可工作。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在具有域内和域外背景的数据集上的性能，即使在ImageNet-1k等复杂场景中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: RCOR是第一个能够在不牺牲任何一方的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，证明了在复杂场景中定位先于识别的可行性。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来改进GAN训练，通过消除判别器中的条件输入来避免冗余捷径，促进纳什均衡，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN训练在实践中难以正确收敛且易出现模式崩溃，作者定量分析了GAN训练中的纳什均衡程度，发现判别器中输入条件会导致冗余捷径，阻碍有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督，促进纳什均衡。该方法与原始GAN理论兼容，可作为插件使用。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到了1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，实验证实了显著的性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: UCD方法通过改进判别器的设计，有效解决了GAN训练中的收敛问题和模式崩溃，为一步生成模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该工作开启了虚拟时尚摄影的新方向，通过数据集构建为生成更具艺术性和叙事性的时尚图像提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的深度伪造检测方法在建模复杂非线性伪造伪影方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效的检测算法。

Method: 使用KAN网络替代固定激活函数，引入Landmark-assisted Adaptive KAN (LAKAN)模块，利用面部关键点作为结构先验动态生成KAN内部参数，引导图像编码器关注关键伪造区域。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将几何先验与网络学习过程相结合，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法主要针对Stable Diffusion设计，在应用于新一代整流流变换器（如Flux）时效果有限，需要专门针对这类模型的攻击评估方法。

Method: 提出基于注意力定位现象的反向注意力优化策略，结合速度引导动态机制增强概念重新激活的鲁棒性，以及一致性保持目标维持全局布局和无关内容。

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估整流流变换器中概念擦除策略的鲁棒性建立了可靠的基准，填补了现有攻击评估方法的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

baselines on two benchmark datasets: it achieves an overall F1 score of 0.81 on

labels, with F1 of 0.99 on Otter and 0.97 on Favorite, while maintaining
competitive accuracy on predefined labels. These results demonstrate OTTER's
effectiveness in bridging closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary
flexibility for multi-modal tagging applications.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在薄云检测和训练样本质量方面存在不足，限制了云检测精度的进一步提升。

Method: 采用渐进式训练框架训练多尺度场景级云检测网络，结合多尺度概率图和云厚度图生成像素级云概率图，最后通过自适应阈值和距离加权优化获得二值云掩码。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的损失函数（流形特征距离，MFD）来解决一致性模型训练中的振荡切向问题，从而加速训练并提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性模型（CMs）虽然能够实现一步或两步的流或扩散采样，但通常需要长时间训练和大批量大小才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现，CMs在收敛附近的训练动态中，其切向（更新方向）是振荡的，即平行于数据流形而非朝向流形，这限制了训练效率。

Method: 提出了流形特征距离（MFD）损失函数，该损失能够提供流形对齐的切向，使更新方向朝向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent（AYT），通过优化切向方向来加速CM训练。

Result: AYT方法能够显著加速CM训练（数量级加速），甚至在LPIPS指标上超越基线方法。此外，该方法支持使用极小的批量大小进行训练，且不牺牲样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过引入MFD损失函数，AYT方法有效解决了CM训练中的振荡切向问题，实现了训练效率的显著提升和样本质量的改进，为快速生成模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督展开的鲁棒主成分分析（U2-rPCA）方法，用于超声微血管成像中的高灵敏度杂波滤波，该方法在数学上可解释且无需学习标签，相比现有方法显著提高了功率多普勒图像的对比度噪声比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奇异值分解（SVD）和鲁棒主成分分析（rPCA）杂波滤波策略在特征建模和组织-血流分离方面存在局限，而基于深度学习的监督滤波器面临可解释性和缺乏体内外真实标签的挑战。

Method: U2-rPCA方法从迭代重加权最小二乘（IRLS）rPCA基线展开，具有内在的低秩和稀疏正则化，并添加了稀疏增强单元以更好地捕捉稀疏微血流信号。该方法类似于自适应滤波器，使用部分图像序列进行训练后应用于后续帧。

Result: 在仿真数据集和公共体内数据集上的实验验证表明，U2-rPCA优于基于SVD的方法、rPCA基线和另一种基于深度学习的滤波器，特别地将功率多普勒图像的对比度噪声比（CNR）提高了2 dB至10 dB。

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法在保持数学可解释性的同时，有效解决了监督学习中的标签依赖问题，并通过消融研究验证了其构建模块的有效性，为超声微血管成像提供了高质量的杂波滤波解决方案。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法通常忽略图像数据的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，而本文旨在统一几何和概率视角，为生成模型提供更全面的理论框架。

Method: 提出几何框架和基于核的概率方法相结合，构建Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM)，包括像素空间和潜在空间版本(LMPPM)。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成模型提供了新的几何-概率统一视角，MPPM框架在理论和实践上都展现出优越性，为未来生成AI研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但实验结果显示二进制编码方法的分割性能明显低于one-hot编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中类别数量众多时，标准的one-hot编码方法会导致计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数量线性增长。作者希望找到更高效的编码策略来应对大规模多类别分割任务。

Method: 提出了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配以及标签嵌入树等技术，应用于包含108个类别的全脑分割任务。

Result: 与one-hot编码(DSC=82.4)相比，二进制编码方法的分割性能显著下降，DSC分数在39.3到73.8之间，未能达到最先进的分割质量。

Conclusion: 尽管二进制编码在极端分类问题中表现出色，但在大规模医学图像分割任务中面临挑战。作者希望这些负面结果能启发未来对紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件-图像知识蒸馏框架，通过CLIP的语义理解实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，采用混合SNN-CNN架构避免事件分割导致的信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏纹理和颜色信息，现有事件检测方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。CLIP等视觉语言模型在RGB图像上表现良好，但无法直接应用于事件流数据。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过基于空间注意力的蒸馏方法指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示。设计混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，解决了事件数据开放词汇检测的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架成功弥合了图像和事件流之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，避免了传统固定分组事件分割方法的信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ProtoMask的新模型架构，通过使用图像分割基础模型来改进原型案例推理方法的可解释性，减少传统显著性映射技术的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于原型案例推理的XAI方法通常依赖后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术在可靠性和质量方面存在争议。作者旨在通过限制显著性映射的计算区域到预定义的语义图像补丁来提高可视化的真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，将每个掩码作为单独输入到ProtoMask模型中。该方法将显著性映射计算限制在语义相关的图像区域。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，ProtoMask模型具有竞争性的性能表现，并展现出独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术有效提高了原型案例推理方法的可解释性和可靠性，为XAI领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个推理驱动的框架，通过结合图变换器和混合专家模块来增强概念瓶颈模型，能够显式建模概念间的结构化关系并提高复杂概念推理的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型存在单模态和忽略结构化概念关系的局限性，无法有效建模复杂的概念交互模式。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入的结构化关系，集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖，并用混合专家模块替换前馈层实现动态专家选择。

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化关系建模和动态专家选择机制，显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的框架，利用多模态大语言模型的内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，通过响应不确定性评分候选视觉输入，使模型能够自主关注最显著的数据，在三个复杂视觉任务上达到与专门微调方法相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务（如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别、长视频中的关键时刻定位）上表现不佳，现有方法通常依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 提出训练无关的框架，核心洞察是模型在呈现相关视觉信息时输出熵会降低。引入统一机制，通过响应不确定性对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能够自主聚焦于最显著的数据。应用于三个任务：视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位。

Result: 使用现成的多模态大语言模型在三个复杂视觉任务上实现了与专门微调方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量应力灌注CMR的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习替代迭代配准，采用三步运动校正流程，结合鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，同时校正灌注序列和辅助图像。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间强度曲线的平滑度，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图显示运动减少，处理时间缩短15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道能够实现快速、鲁棒的运动校正，经过多厂商数据训练后具有良好的泛化能力，有望促进定量灌注成像的临床推广应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何使用低成本的简化EEG设备（仅12个通道）通过Vision Transformer模型实现高精度的情绪预测，在DEAP数据集上达到91.57%的准确率，与32通道的先进方法（96.9%）相比性能损失很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪识别方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整的EEG测量过程复杂且成本高昂。低成本简化EEG设备为情绪识别提供了更直接、无偏的数据源，但需要验证其有效性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练Vision Transformer模型进行情绪分类（4象限：高/低唤醒度和效价）。

Result: 仅使用12个测量通道时，模型在情绪分类任务上达到了91.57%的准确率，与使用32个通道的先进方法（96.9%准确率）相比，性能下降很小但显著降低了设备复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过合理的通道选择和先进的深度学习模型，低成本简化EEG设备能够实现接近完整EEG测量的情绪识别性能，为实际应用提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can
be found here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对极端盲图像恢复（EBIR）的新框架，通过分解极低质量（ELQ）到高质量（HQ）的恢复过程，使用投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间低质量（LQ）流形，再通过现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在处理极端退化情况时效果不佳，因为直接从ELQ到HQ的映射存在巨大的域差距，容易产生不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 提出分解恢复过程：首先学习一个投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形，然后使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复为HQ。基于信息理论，将图像恢复视为信息瓶颈问题，推导出理论驱动的训练目标。

Result: 在严重退化情况下的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够稳定训练并提升现有图像恢复模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架支持推理时提示优化和即插即用的图像恢复模型增强，无需微调，为解决极端盲图像恢复问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Conclusion: 该系统实现了高效、可靠和自动化的质量控制，在陶瓷制造的非破坏性测试中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像-文本对齐评估方法缺乏全面基准，且在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性等方面存在不足，需要开发更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 基于预训练的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的冻结隐藏状态，训练轻量级岭回归层，构建多目标评分预测器MULTI-TAP，支持细粒度多目标评分和单一总体评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在7-8B参数规模下性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当，在多项基准测试中优于VisionREWARD模型，且效率更高。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为解决图像-文本对齐评估的关键挑战提供了有效方案，新数据集EYE4ALL为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别关注盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型，限制了在实际场景中的应用，需要更高效的攻击方法

Method: 通过提取DNN的特征映射，将其添加到干净图像中生成对抗样本，仅需单次查询即可攻击目标模型

Result: ZQBA能够在CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet等数据集上实现跨模型和跨数据集的对抗样本迁移，攻击效果优于现有单次查询方法

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN在实际应用中的脆弱性，为开发更鲁棒的防御机制提供了重要参考

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持概念瓶颈模型可解释性的同时，有效提升了分类性能和不确定性处理能力。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在输入提示发生微小语言变化时难以保持语义一致性，即使逻辑等价的提示对也会产生不一致的图像，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用元变测试生成语法不同但语义相同的提示对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，分类对齐错误类型（如实体遗漏、重复、位置错位等），并提供反例用于模型调试。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估显示，即使如Flux.dev和DALLE-3这样的SOTA模型也分别有59%和71%的错位率，MetaLogic能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致性。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种高效、可扩展且无需真实图像的评估方法，能有效诊断T2I模型的逻辑理解鲁棒性问题，为模型改进提供有价值见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 建筑立面是城市密集环境中未充分利用的太阳能资源，但由于复杂几何形状和语义组件，评估其光伏潜力具有挑战性。

Method: 四阶段流水线：几何校正、零样本语义分割、LLM引导的空间推理和能量模拟。

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic

Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成工作主要关注短片段，且只与单一参考标准比较，忽略了音频描述创作的主观性本质。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道，量化描述的主观性；提出ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解问题，评估几分钟长的连贯视频片段。

Result: 发现当前音频描述生成方法在帮助盲人和低视力用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面远落后于人工创作。

Conclusion: 提出了未来工作的建议，并建立了公开排行榜用于基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo为开发能够同时推理语义和几何的模型提供了基础，将促进多模态学习的发展

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

TL;DR: NSARM是一个基于自回归模型的实时图像超分辨率框架，通过两阶段训练实现高质量、高效率的图像重建，相比现有方法具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在效率与质量难以兼顾的问题：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，基于直接映射的方法速度快但质量低，且都面临对输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM)框架，采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端的全模型微调，保持生成能力的同时增强鲁棒性。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有Real-ISR方法，在保持快速推理速度的同时实现更优的视觉效果，对输入图像质量变化表现出更高的鲁棒性和更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在Real-ISR任务中实现了效率与质量的平衡，解决了现有方法的局限性，为图像超分辨率提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次级别上固有的类别间关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：G-HMLC使用高斯混合模型，A-HMLC使用注意力机制来捕获层次特定特征，模拟人类处理方式。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，线性评估中准确率比现有层次对比学习方法高出2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模层次间关系和不平衡类别分布，实现了跨所有层次级别的细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Conclusion: 世界模型的先验知识为视觉语言模型提供了有前景的新方向，WorldLMs展示了利用世界模型先验构建通用视觉学习器的潜力。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和自注意力机制的混合架构GSMamba，用于视频超分辨率任务，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决时空依赖建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频超分辨率方法使用循环架构存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但计算复杂度高且难以处理长序列。Mamba模型虽然具有线性复杂度但缺乏空间上下文聚合能力。

Method: 提出混合架构：使用移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合，结合Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时序传播。引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回各帧，减少遮挡伪影并确保信息有效重分布。

Result: 论文提供了官方实现，表明该方法能够有效解决视频超分辨率中的时空依赖建模问题，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: GSMamba通过结合Mamba的线性复杂度优势和自注意力的空间建模能力，为视频超分辨率任务提供了一个高效且有效的解决方案，特别适合处理长序列视频数据。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型在保持高诊断性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率，为青光眼诊断提供了更有效的3D OCT分析方法。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Method: 采用任务型调查方法，对机器学习从业者进行调查研究，关注他们选择源数据集的实际决策过程，而非传统的模型基准测试。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和人机交互工具来明确选择启发式，为迁移学习中更系统的源数据集选择提供实用指导。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一个轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，能够支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: 基于本文新发现的语义方向现象构建的VPFA框架，为跨分辨率行人重识别提供了有效且优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

*Ziqing Zhang,Kai Liu,Zheng Chen,Xi Li,Yucong Chen,Bingnan Duan,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR是一种新的视频超分辨率方法，采用自回归单步扩散范式，能够高效处理无限长度视频，实现58倍加速并保持最佳质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：全长度序列多步去噪的低效率，以及时间分解导致的伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练的DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉引导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用块状像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 该方法在长序列视频超分辨率中达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，比MGLD-VSR等方法快58倍。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长形式视频超分辨率的限制，建立了新的长视频评估基准，为无限长度视频处理提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理离散的视觉和文本标记，在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在训练时注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。该模型在ImageNet-1K上表现出强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成依赖于以标记为中心的架构，但有效融合文本和视觉标记仍然是一个挑战。需要一种能够在保持任务无关主干的同时增强融合的方法。

Method: 提出JEPA-T框架，将图像和标题编码为离散标记，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理。在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，训练时注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。推理时通过迭代去噪视觉标记来生成图像。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化能力， consistently优于非融合和晚期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 晚期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与主干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

*Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastForward是一种实时视觉定位方法，能够在单次前向传播中同时构建地图表示并重定位查询图像，大幅减少映射时间的同时保持竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。

Result: 与图像检索结合后达到最先进精度，映射准备时间极短，且在未见过的户外大尺度环境中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了在保持高精度的同时大幅减少映射时间的可行性，为实时视觉定位系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

*Jiamian Wang,Ziqi Zhou,Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi,Sohail Dianat,Majid Rabbani,Raghuveer Rao,Chen Qiu,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用的精炼模块来增强自回归模型在视觉序列生成中的空间对应关系建模，通过后预训练步骤联合优化所有生成标记，改善视觉语言建模质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在序列建模中表现出色，但视觉信号的空间特性与下一个标记预测的顺序依赖性存在冲突，导致次优结果。需要解决视觉序列生成中的空间对应关系建模问题。

Method: 设计了一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用全局上下文和标记间的关系来联合优化自回归模型生成的所有标记。该模块作为即插即用组件，在共享的顺序预测框架下增强视觉语言建模。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力，有效缓解了顺序生成中的错误累积问题。

Conclusion: 提出的精炼模块能够有效改善自回归模型在视觉语言任务中的表现，通过增强空间对应关系建模来提升生成结果的语义一致性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的自适应扰动和步长归一化，解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的指导衰减和过度指导问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用分类器自由引导时面临两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码进程快速消失）和过度指导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）。

Method: SoftCFG是一种训练无关、模型无关的推理方法，核心思想是让每个生成的token基于其不确定性贡献加权指导，并引入步长归一化来限制累积扰动。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最优的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG有效解决了自回归模型中CFG的局限性，为条件图像生成提供了更稳定和高质量的指导机制。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新的解释框架，通过结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，为深度视觉模型生成包含自然语言的解释，既能显示模型关注的位置，又能描述支持决策的视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM及其变体虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活背后语义属性的洞察，限制了模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: TextCAM利用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，然后与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述，将精确的空间定位与语义对齐相结合。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能生成忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过将视觉激活与语义描述相结合，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富、更直观的解释框架，增强了模型的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

### [87] [POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA提出了一种数据高效的视频问答方法，通过时间池化将每秒视频压缩为单帧图像，并利用轻量级监督对齐大视觉语言模型，显著提升了视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在视频问答中虽然能处理1500+帧的长视频，但仅对应50秒视频内容，信息损失严重。需要一种更高效的方法来压缩视频信息并保持时序证据。

Method: 使用多种时间池化方法（运动模糊、加权平均等）将每秒视频压缩为1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B模型进行监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO），包含推理过程和最终答案的两轮对话目标。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量也显著提高。跨池化方案的评估显示方法具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: POVQA方法通过时间池化压缩和轻量级监督优化，有效提升了视频问答性能，证明了在时序证据总结方面的强鲁棒性，在TVQA上的零样本评估也得到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

TL;DR: ImageDoctor是一个统一的多方面文本到图像模型评估框架，通过四个维度评估图像质量并提供像素级缺陷指示，可作为密集奖励用于模型偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，限制了提供全面可解释反馈的能力。需要更全面的评估框架来支持文本到图像模型的可靠人类偏好建模。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式，模型先定位潜在缺陷，生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，通过监督微调和强化学习训练，评估四个维度：合理性、语义对齐、美学和整体质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为评估指标有效。用作偏好调优的奖励模型时，生成质量显著提升，比基于标量的奖励模型提高10%。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor提供了全面可解释的图像质量评估，可作为密集奖励有效提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对高光谱图像的新型对抗训练方法AT-RA，通过数据增强和空间平滑性处理，有效提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时提高了正常分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱分类模型易受对抗攻击威胁，现有防御方法存在可扩展性差和防御效果有限的问题。高光谱数据具有独特的挑战，对抗噪声会破坏重要的光谱语义信息。

Method: 将对抗训练引入高光谱领域，提出AT-RA方法，通过数据增强增加光谱信息多样性，确保空间平滑性来保护和校正光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA将对抗鲁棒性提升了21.34%（对抗AutoAttack）和18.78%（对抗PGD-50），同时将正常准确率提高了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据对抗训练中的独特挑战，是提升高光谱分类模型安全性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的安全、高质量可逆人脸匿名化方法，通过结合密钥机制和扩散模型，在保持高质量图像的同时实现安全的可逆匿名化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸匿名化方法难以在安全性和图像质量之间取得平衡，扩散模型缺乏密钥机制确保只有授权方才能逆转过程

Method: 将密钥与人脸潜在表示结合，使用面部mask约束生成以保留身份无关特征，采用确定性前向和后向扩散过程

Result: 相比其他方法，该方法生成的匿名化人脸与原始人脸的视觉相似度更低

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: 提出了一个真实的离散扩散框架，通过一系列协调机制在one-hot空间中直接保留核心扩散特性，重新定义了先前的伪离散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的伪离散扩散方法依赖于在连续潜在空间中的扩散或掩码策略，而ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间中实现真实的离散扩散，弥合判别式学习和生成式学习之间的差距。

Method: 使用浮点数编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间，建立判别式与生成式学习的桥梁。

Result: 在分类任务上优于基线方法，并在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协调机制在one-hot空间中实现了真实的离散扩散，实验验证了各组件带来的可测量增益。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景图构建方法语义受限，仅支持预定义关系集，且在大环境中序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口。

Method: 将3D场景表示为包含楼层、房间、对象和功能元素的分层图，节点通过关键帧增强多模态信息，利用分层RAG管道从图中提取相关上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: KeySG展示了优越的语义丰富性和效率，能够处理复杂和模糊查询，同时缓解大型场景图的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: Code2Video是一个基于代码的代理框架，通过可执行的Python代码生成教育视频，解决了传统生成模型在专业教育视频制作中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型在制作专业教育视频时存在局限，无法满足学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡的要求。通过可渲染环境的逻辑控制（如代码）能更好地解决这些需求。

Method: Code2Video框架包含三个协作代理：(1) Planner规划时间连贯的内容流和视觉资源；(2) Coder将结构化指令转换为可执行Python代码，采用范围引导的自动修复提高效率；(3) Critic利用视觉语言模型和视觉锚点提示优化空间布局和清晰度。

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video在美学评分、代码效率和TeachQuiz端到端指标上表现优异，比直接代码生成方法提升40%，生成视频质量接近人工制作的教程。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个世界模型，通过结合全景视频生成和演化的3D记忆，实现空间一致的长时程探索。它利用单张全景图像生成未来视频帧，并通过演化的3D重建提供空间引导，显著提升视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够在脑海中探索和重放先前体验的3D环境的能力启发，旨在开发能够进行空间一致长时程探索的世界模型。

Method: 1. 输入单张全景图像生成未来视频帧；2. 使用前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建；3. 基于演化3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧；4. 利用演化3D重建作为视频生成的空间引导。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，EvoWorld的演化3D记忆显著提高了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展，通过演化3D记忆有效提升了视频生成的空间一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主题编辑的挑战，特别是提示侧多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，利用大模型的理解和生成能力生成多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后将掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型过度依赖模仿学习导致的复合错误和分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题，同时避免传统RL方法需要昂贵真实交互或存在sim-to-real差距的缺点。

Method: 使用真实交互数据训练的世界模型作为可控模拟器，预测基于动作的未来视觉观察，通过目标达成参考生成密集的轨迹级奖励信号，实现高效的动作对齐学习。

Result: VLA-RFT在不到400步微调后超越了强监督基线，比基于模拟器的RL更高效，在扰动条件下表现出强鲁棒性，保持稳定的任务执行能力。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的RFT是一种实用的后训练范式，可有效增强VLA模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合训练框架（HyT），使视觉语言动作模型（VLA）能够在训练时学习思维链（CoT）带来的性能提升，同时在推理时无需生成CoT，从而减少推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoT）技术虽然能提升复杂语言任务的性能，但会显著增加推理时间，这在需要实时动作的机器人操作场景中严重影响实用性。

Method: HyT框架通过混合训练使VLA模型能够学习从思维中受益，同时支持在推理时有条件地预测多样化输出：直接预测动作、生成思维或遵循指令。

Result: 在模拟基准测试和真实世界实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HyT框架解决了CoT推理延迟问题，同时保持了性能优势，为机器人操作提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET是一个可扩展框架，通过引入时刻令牌和轻量级记忆模块，使视觉-语言-动作模型能够利用历史上下文进行动作预测，在需要历史信息的长期任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务本质上是历史依赖的，但现有视觉-语言-动作模型仅依赖当前观察而忽略历史上下文，这限制了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 提出时刻令牌来紧凑编码每个时间步的感知信息，通过时间对比学习初始化表示；使用轻量级记忆模块整合历史时刻令牌为记忆特征，用于动作预测。

Result: 在GR00T N1.5上实现76.4%的平均成功率，比基线提升47.2%；在RoboCasa Kitchen上从64.1%提升至66.4%，在LIBERO上从95.6%提升至97.7%。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功将最先进的VLA模型转化为历史感知策略，在历史依赖任务和通用机器人操作基准上都表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于双角色长时程交互中间运动生成的方法，通过跨空间中间运动建模和对抗学习来解决交互角色运动合成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中间运动生成方法主要针对单角色，扩展到密集交互角色时面临空间-时间对应关系精确性和自然过渡的挑战。

Method: 提出Cross-Space In-Betweening方法，在不同条件表示空间中建模每个角色的交互；通过对抗学习识别周期性交互模式维持交互质量；学习细化漂移的潜在空间防止姿态误差累积。

Result: 该方法能够生成逼真、可控、长时程的双角色中间运动，支持动态拳击和舞蹈动作，通过定量评估和用户研究验证了效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了双角色交互中间运动生成的挑战，能够维持长期交互和运动质量。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes.
Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to
densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise
spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sliced Wasserstein距离(SWD)虽然比Wasserstein距离计算更高效，但其蒙特卡洛估计器存在高方差问题，导致梯度噪声大、收敛慢。

Method: 将加权蓄水池采样(Weighted Reservoir Sampling)集成到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，保持无偏性的同时实现稳定梯度。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际任务（如色彩校正和扩散引导）中，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSWD通过自适应投影方向选择有效解决了SWD的高方差问题，在保持无偏性的同时显著提升了优化性能。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

Conclusion: 该框架为实时VR社交互动提供了高效的面部动画解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注图像是否被AI生成/编辑，但无法判断可疑图像是否从特定基础图像编辑而来，也无法识别具体使用的编辑模型。

Method: EditTrack基于对编辑过程的四个关键观察，引入新颖的重新编辑策略，利用精心设计的相似性度量来判断可疑图像是否源自基础图像以及使用的编辑模型。

Result: 在五个最先进编辑模型和六个数据集上的评估显示，EditTrack能够实现准确的检测和归因，显著优于五个基线方法。

Conclusion: EditTrack是首个专门针对图像编辑检测和归因问题的框架，通过重新编辑策略和相似性度量，有效解决了从特定基础图像检测编辑并识别编辑模型的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection
and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to
determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an
AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing
model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated
images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether
an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a
particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first
framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on
four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel
re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to
determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,
by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models
across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate
detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的层间相关性传播(LRP)方法依赖启发式规则集，这些规则在清晰度和模型行为对齐方面未经过优化，需要在细节和可解释性之间进行权衡

Method: 提出EVO-LRP方法，应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来基于忠实度或稀疏性等量化可解释性指标调整LRP超参数

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征表现出强敏感性

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的、任务特定的优化来系统性地改进

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量的变分潜在先验（EVaLP）方法，通过将先验建模为能量模型来改善变分自编码器的样本生成质量，同时保持高效的采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分自编码器（VAE）存在生成模糊和不一致样本的问题，主要原因是"先验空洞"问题。传统方法在灵活性和采样效率之间存在权衡，需要一种既能匹配后验分布又能快速采样的先验建模方法。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型（EBM），并引入变分方法来处理EBM的归一化常数，避免了昂贵的MCMC方法。通过交替优化问题训练先验，并使用采样器网络作为隐式变分先验实现高效采样。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，EVaLP方法在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和提高采样效率方面都显示出改进。

Conclusion: 基于能量的变分潜在先验方法有效解决了VAE中的先验空洞问题，在保持采样效率的同时显著提升了生成样本的质量。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的即插即用框架，通过逐步优化提示词来改进扩散模型的对齐效果，避免直接修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面存在不足，而现有提示词优化方法多为前向方式，未能充分利用扩散模型的序列特性。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型（MLLM）通过RL基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态逐步更新提示词，实现结构上与Diffusion RL的类比。

Result: 实验表明PromptLoop能有效优化奖励函数、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop提供了一个灵活且通用的提示词对齐框架，在保持模型权重的同时实现了有效的RL优化。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知动态增强方法，通过根据样本对模型优化的影响动态调整增强强度，解决传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变。如果不考虑这种动态性，会导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: 通过计算样本梯度在累积模型更新方向上的投影，并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计样本影响力。低方差样本（稳定影响）进行更强增强以强调多样性，高方差样本（不稳定影响）进行较温和变换以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来显著改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，无需辅助模型或策略调优，能有效提升训练效果，具有很好的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种无需记忆缓冲和任务边界的在线持续学习方法，通过结合提示学习和NCM分类器有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用记忆缓冲存储样本（存在数据安全和隐私问题），要么依赖任务边界识别（在单次数据处理中难以实现），因此需要研究无需记忆缓冲和任务边界的在线持续学习。

Method: 通过整合提示学习和NCM（最近类均值）分类器，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份的情况下处理灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，所提方法在无需记忆缓冲和任务边界的情况下有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需记忆缓冲和任务边界的在线持续学习，为处理灾难性遗忘提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)来诊断持续学习中的捷径特征依赖问题，揭示了持续学习方法在面对捷径特征时的刚性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（无因果意义的输入-标签关联），这会削弱鲁棒性。在持续学习中，捷径特征的利用会导致认知定势效应，阻碍新技能的获取。

Method: 引入ERI诊断指标，包含三个可解释维度：适应延迟(AD)、性能缺陷(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上测试了多种CL方法。

Result: CL方法比从头训练基线更快达到准确率阈值但最终准确率稍低；遮挡捷径特征（品红色斑块）提高了CL方法的准确率，表明该斑块是干扰因素而非帮助性捷径。

Conclusion: 持续学习方法在面对捷径特征时表现出刚性，ERI能够有效诊断这种捷径诱导的刚性问题，为改进CL方法提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Conclusion: Object-AVEdit成功实现了对象级的音视频编辑，解决了音视频编辑中对象级操作的技术挑战，为音视频后期制作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域（如点、边界框、掩码），限制了其在需要局部定位用户意图的应用场景中的潜力。

Method: 结合分割模型和视觉语言模型，开发VIRTUE框架，使分割模型能够处理视觉提示来精确定位图像中的特定区域，从而提升嵌入模型在复杂场景下的精确性。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模分割和场景字幕检索基准上，VIRTUE在36个通用多模态嵌入任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互任务上提升15.2%-20.3%。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力引入表示学习，为嵌入模型开辟了新的应用方向，同时通过实体级信息学习增强了传统嵌入任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型部分来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成解释，这会导致分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法不需要额外训练或微调，且不会改变网络的决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上都表现出更好的鲁棒性（提升高达62.5%），且不需要领域知识来选择遮挡值。

Conclusion: ConvAD提供了一种更鲁棒的解释方法，消除了传统遮挡方法的局限性，为图像分类器的解释提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent
seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide.
While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based
transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly
complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep
learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene
expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs
GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion
parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor
Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient
preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent
pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets
including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal
several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal
astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored
excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in
combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and
effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from
retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without
any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant
risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in
uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to
reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making
in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction
coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a
more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the
uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance
metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted
cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution,
establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection
improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.

Conclusion: InfoVAE-Med3D在重建和下游预测任务中持续优于其他VAE变体，为基于MRI的生物标志物和神经疾病认知恶化的更透明分析提供了实用路径

Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D
brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard
statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most
deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to
explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables,
producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful
content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527)
with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles
University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression,
preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid
interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks,
InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger
information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance
with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based
biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSI生存分析方法存在解释性有限和忽视异质性切片图像预测不确定性的问题。

Method: 提出DPsurv双原型网络，通过证据融合处理不确定性，利用补丁原型分配和组件相对风险聚合实现可解释性。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上获得最高平均一致性指数和最低平均集成Brier分数，验证了方法的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: DPsurv在特征、推理和决策层面提供透明度，增强了生存分析的可信度和可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival
analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both
cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and
prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in
WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook
predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose
DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that
outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of
predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and
component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly
available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest
mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of
DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the
feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness
and interpretability of DPsurv.

TL;DR: SkinGPT-4在皮肤疾病诊断中存在肤色偏见，对深色肤色的诊断准确性较低。研究通过微调模型和公平性分析，开发了更公平的定制模型，显著改善了肤色间的诊断公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SkinGPT-4等大型视觉语言模型在皮肤疾病诊断中存在的肤色偏见问题，特别是在训练数据主要代表浅色肤色的情况下，确保模型对所有肤色患者都能提供准确的诊断。

Method: 使用SCIN数据集评估SkinGPT-4在不同肤色上的性能偏差，开发微调模型用于定制皮肤疾病分类任务，并探索偏差缓解策略。通过临床评估和公平性指标（如人口均等和均等化几率）进行分析。

Result: SkinGPT-4在肤色间存在显著性能差异，平均人口均等为0.10，最浅和最深层肤色间差异达0.10-0.15。定制模型实现了平均F1分数0.75、精确度0.78和AUROC 0.78，公平性分析显示平均人口均等为0.75，最佳模型在Fitzpatrick I-VI肤色上的均等分数为0.83-0.90。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型如SkinGPT-4在深色肤色上表现较弱，存在模型偏差和幻觉问题。研究表明通过现有骨干网络训练准确、公平的定制模型是有效的，有助于改善皮肤疾病诊断的公平性。

Abstract: SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease
images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its
training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting
diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in
SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema,
allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset.
We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin
disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical
evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from
300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity,
physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including
demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones.
SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick
types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones
across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy
occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1,
precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease
pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a
maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity
scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI,
indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed
weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation
criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings
demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing
backbones for custom skin disease classification.

*Priyanka Mudgal,Feng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于N-gram上下文的Swin Transformer图像压缩方法，通过增强上下文感知能力实现单模型可变速率压缩，在高分辨率重建和感兴趣区域质量方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Swin Transformer在高分辨率图像重建中由于受限感受野而忽略更大区域的问题，提升像素恢复的质量和上下文感知能力。

Method: 将N-gram上下文机制集成到Swin Transformer中，扩展像素恢复时考虑的区域范围，增强相邻窗口间的上下文关联。

Result: 相比现有可变速率学习图像压缩技术，BD-Rate提升了-5.86%，显著改善了高分辨率重建质量和感兴趣区域的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在制造和工业视觉系统等对象聚焦应用中具有显著优势，通过增强上下文感知实现了更高质量的可变速率图像压缩。

Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned
image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single
model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome
its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image
reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands
the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of
high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across
neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing
variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model
improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it
particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as
manufacturing and industrial vision systems.

Abstract: Osteoporosis silently erodes skeletal integrity worldwide; however, early
detection through imaging can prevent most fragility fractures. Artificial
intelligence (AI) methods now mine routine Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry
(DXA), X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans for subtle, clinically actionable markers, but the literature is
fragmented. This survey unifies the field through a tri-axial framework that
couples imaging modalities with clinical tasks and AI methodologies (classical
machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers,
self-supervised learning, and explainable AI). Following a concise clinical and
technical primer, we detail our Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided search strategy, introduce the
taxonomy via a roadmap figure, and synthesize cross-study insights on data
scarcity, external validation, and interpretability. By identifying emerging
trends, open challenges, and actionable research directions, this review
provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and musculoskeletal
clinicians with a clear compass to accelerate rigorous, patient-centered
innovation in osteoporosis care. The project page of this survey can also be

### [125] [A Fast and Precise Method for Searching Rectangular Tumor Regions in Brain MR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00505)
*Hidenori Takeshima,Shuki Maruyama*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 开发了一种快速精确的脑肿瘤图像矩形区域搜索方法，结合分割网络和可加速计算的搜索算法，相比传统方法速度提升100-500倍，且能更好地识别立方体形状的肿瘤区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑肿瘤图像矩形区域搜索方法处理速度慢，且搜索指标偏好细长形状而非更自然的立方体形状肿瘤区域，需要开发更快速精确的搜索方法。

Method: 使用EfficientNet作为编码器的U-Net分割网络，结合求和面积表加速3D矩形区域搜索，设计可用户控制的搜索指标，优先选择立方体形状和高肿瘤分数的区域。

Result: 3D全搜索时间从11-40分钟减少到8秒，速度提升100-500倍；新搜索指标获得的肿瘤分数更高，且相比传统方法偏好细长形状，新方法更偏好立方体形状。

Conclusion: 该方法在脑肿瘤MRI诊断中具有应用前景，显著减少了3D全搜索的处理时间，并提高了矩形肿瘤区域的质量。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular
regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for
searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method
consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a
user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose
encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,
summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular
regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D
offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to
cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even
if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric
were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor
Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the
proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional
computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search
metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were
higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional
metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes.
Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise
search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis
using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D
full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned
rectangular tumor regions.

*Zulkaif Sajjad,Furqan Shaukat,Junaid Mir*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: U-DFA是一种结合DINOv2和Unet的编码器-解码器架构，通过新颖的局部-全局融合适配器（LGFA）增强医学图像分割性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平且仅需33%可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型受限于局部感受野，无法捕获全局上下文；结合transformer的方法未能有效融合局部和全局特征；基于VLM和基础模型的方法存在领域差距和高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出U-DFA架构，集成LGFA模块，通过基于CNN的空间模式适配器（SPA）将空间特征注入到冻结的DINOv2块中，实现高层语义和空间特征的有效融合。

Result: 在Synapse和ACDC数据集上达到最先进性能，仅需33%的可训练模型参数。

Conclusion: U-DFA是一个鲁棒且可扩展的医学图像分割框架，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis
and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based
models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and
fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with
transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the
local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation
models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however,
they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this
end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that
integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation
performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial
Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages,
enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets
with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate
that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation
across multiple modalities.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种从秀丽隐杆线虫（C. elegans）运动记录中提取行为单元的新方法，该方法不需要完整的虫体视图，使用无监督自动流程定义行为单元，避免了预设假设带来的偏差。

Method: 开发了一种无监督自动流程，从单点线虫跟踪数据中提取行为单元，不依赖完整的虫体视图。通过将自动方法得到的行为单元与人工设计的行为单元进行比较来解读结果，并使用基于代理的模型评估模拟线虫运动与自然线虫运动的匹配程度。

Result: 研究表明，即使从单点线虫跟踪中也能出现时空运动模式，这些模式代表了行为分类过程的基本方面。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高密度条件下线虫行为分析的挑战，证明了单点跟踪数据中行为模式的重要性，为行为分类提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of
biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to
complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several
methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods
extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using
different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require
a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For
example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly
informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single
worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract
behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not
necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the
behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees
the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural
analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are
interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The
effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to
which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the
movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal
locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we
show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural
classification process.
