### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过使用增强的合成图像和真实数据进行训练，解决了小目标检测和标注数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发能够在实时条件下准确检测小目标的系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR框架，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成/真实训练样本的智能权重策略，通过数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了一个完整的Python鲁棒海上检测管道，在极端光照或海况下仍能保持实时性能，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度和精度，有效缩小了合成与真实域之间的视觉差距。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval是一个新的文本到视频评估基准，专注于动态相机运动，解决了现有基准的两个局限性：缺乏动态相机运动评估和视频级评估不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频评估基准如VBench和EvalCrafter存在两个主要问题：(i) 主要关注主体中心提示或静态相机场景，忽视了动态相机运动；(ii) 通常将视频级分数聚合为单一模型级分数，忽略了视频级评估的重要性。

Method: DynamicEval包含系统策划的强调动态相机运动的提示，并收集了45k个人类标注。提出了两个新指标：背景场景一致性指标（通过对象错误图修正VBench运动平滑度指标的失败案例）和前景对象一致性指标（跟踪对象实例内的点及其邻居来评估对象保真度）。

Result: 实验表明，提出的指标在视频级和模型级都实现了与人类偏好更强的相关性（改进超过2个百分点）。

Conclusion: DynamicEval建立了一个更全面的基准，用于评估动态相机运动下的文本到视频模型。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP是一种改进的RED方法，通过重启惯性机制实现快速收敛，同时保持基于分数的图像先验以实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂的图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速往往依赖启发式方法。RISP旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: RISP将重启惯性机制引入RED框架，结合基于分数的图像先验，形成一种有原则的扩展方法。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，且不需要图像先验的凸性假设。实验验证了其在各种成像逆问题中的快速收敛和高质量重建能力。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制成功实现了快速收敛和高质量图像重建的统一，为成像逆问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像纯化策略的超低剂量CT去噪框架，通过生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对解决数据不匹配问题，并结合频域流匹配模型实现优异的解剖结构保持效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT虽然显著降低辐射暴露，但会引入严重噪声和伪影，并导致uLDCT与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著空间不对齐，这给现有去噪网络在真实临床数据上的应用带来挑战。

Method: 首先构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，然后提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的图像对，在此基础上提出频域流匹配模型，与IP策略协同工作以保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP策略显著提升了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，提出的FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能够在资源受限的对抗设置下有效移除或削弱现有语义水印方案，揭示当前水印设计的基本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和来源的水印方法需求日益增长。然而，现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然存在漏洞。

Method: 通过将水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，D2RA在保持视觉保真度的同时抑制水印信号。该方法无需访问底层模型，也不需要训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，D2RA能够持续降低各种水印方案的可检测性，证明了当前水印设计的基本脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了现有语义水印方案在对抗攻击下的根本弱点，为改进水印技术的鲁棒性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一种基于扩散模型的视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器和利用静态图像数据进行训练，实现时间一致、风格忠实且内容保留的视频风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移任务中缺乏配对视频数据监督的问题，目标是保持输入视频内容的同时根据文本提示渲染目标风格。

Method: 提出PickStyle框架，在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器到自注意力层，利用配对的静态图像数据构建合成训练片段，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导（CS-CFG）方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保留的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换效果。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TRAVL方法和ImplausiBench基准，用于评估和改进视频生成模型的物理合理性，解决了现有视频语言模型在时空和因果推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型虽然视觉保真度高，但经常产生违反物理定律的序列，目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块，改进VLMs的运动编码和判别能力；同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150真实+150生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时间理解。

Result: 发现现有VLMs难以识别物理违规，暴露了其时空和因果推理的基本局限性。TRAVL和ImplausiBench为评估和改进多模态模型的物理合理性提供了统一框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为探索和改进多模态模型的物理合理性提供了新方法，揭示了视觉-时间理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出S3FN网络，利用LLM生成的文本描述增强高光谱图像分类性能，通过语义-光谱-空间融合解决过拟合问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，且现有方法多为单模态仅依赖光谱空间数据

Method: 使用LLM生成类别文本描述，通过BERT等文本编码器提取语义特征，与光谱空间特征融合进行多模态分类

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上取得显著性能提升，验证了文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同效应

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱空间数据的融合为语义增强的高光谱分类模型开辟了新途径

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量高效的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆敏感信息并在推理时泄露，现有遗忘方法主要针对文本模型，视觉语言模型的跨模态特性增加了遗忘的复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的重要性，通过外部模块对低重要性视觉token进行编码转换来实现遗忘，避免修改预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，且无需重新训练成本，实现了有效的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: CAGUL框架为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用且高效的遗忘解决方案，在防止信息泄露的同时保持了模型原有的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaSC算法，使用低成本无人机RGB图像和轻量级YOLOv9模型自动计数玉米苗株，在两种模式下均表现出与人工计数的高度一致性，处理速度快，适合实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玉米株数准确计数对作物管理和研究至关重要，但人工计数劳动密集、速度慢且易出错，尤其在大面积或变化大的田地中。

Method: MaSC算法有两种模式：1）将拼接图像分块处理；2）使用单应性矩阵对齐原始视频帧。两种模式都使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米苗，区分玉米与杂草，基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃人工计数对比，拼接图像模式R^2=0.616，原始帧模式R^2=0.906。处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒（含推理和后处理）。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本、准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) 是一种快速的胶囊网络替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量来加速网络，在保持较高准确率的同时实现5倍推理速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶囊网络虽然在某些任务上优于传统CNN，但训练和推理速度较慢，这限制了其在实时应用中的使用。

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，同时采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上实现了5倍的推理速度提升，准确率损失很小。

Conclusion: QCN为开发快速实时应用的胶囊网络提供了一个可行的起点。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种针对整流流模型的改进条件引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型上引起的离流形漂移问题，通过自适应预测器-校正器引导实现更稳定的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器无关引导在整流流模型上会产生严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种新的引导方法来保持稳定性。

Method: 提出自适应预测器-校正器引导：首先执行条件整流流更新将样本锚定在学习的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正来插值条件和无条件速度场。

Result: 实验证明该方法在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上，在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文本到图像模型中均优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++确保了轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在广泛的引导强度范围内保持稳定性，解决了整流流模型的条件引导问题。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIT-QMM是一种新型大型多模态模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，通过融合文本、图像和点云数据，在质量评分和失真定位方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得进展，但在3D点云质量评估领域尚未充分探索，特别是无参考点云质量评估的需求。

Method: 利用文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图的多模态互补信息，构建端到端的PIT-QMM模型，能够同时处理文本、图像和点云数据来预测质量分数。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，训练迭代次数更少，同时能够实现失真定位和识别，提升模型可解释性和交互性。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM为无参考点云质量评估开辟了新途径，展示了多模态融合在3D质量评估中的有效性，并为模型可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer模型中面临参数过多和缺乏时序特征的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用图像换装模型处理首帧，然后在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息指导视频生成模型逐帧合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持领先性能的同时，实现了优异的参数效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过创新的首帧换装策略，有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的个性化扩散模型改进方法，通过在第二次推理过程中使用掩码限制图像标记，让文本提示能更好地控制背景生成，提高主题与提示的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型在生成图像时容易过度关注主题而忽略文本提示，导致只是简单复制主题图像而无法根据提示生成合适的背景场景。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码在第二次推理过程中对图像标记进行掩码处理，将主题限制在掩码区域内，让文本提示能够专注于背景部分的生成。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在位置和场景描述文本提示下能够准确描绘主题，同时与提示高度匹配，显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过掩码机制分离主题和背景生成过程，有效解决了个性化扩散模型中主题过度主导的问题，实现了更好的文本提示控制效果。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)减少解剖结构错位累积，并采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在医学图像配准中实现更高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现优异，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法根据图像的不同变形需求自适应确定迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 1) 提出FERM作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场；2) 提出双阶段TCI策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性；3) 将FERM和TCI集成构建TCIP模型。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在精度上优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数规模。

Conclusion: TCIP模型有效解决了解剖结构错位累积和迭代次数自适应确定的问题，FERM和TCI具有良好的通用性，可集成到现有配准网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，无法满足实际工作流中对不同粒度用户控制（精确轨迹到粗粒度文本）的混合需求。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推理来近似组合分布，利用多个视频生成主干网络共同满足所有任务约束。通过逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件分解技术解决优化挑战。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比先前工作，在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面产生更好的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多粒度控制视频生成的需求，为视频工作流提供了更灵活的控制能力。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MLH的弱到强框架，通过从基于成对的较弱分支转移知识来增强基于中心的哈希分支，解决了基于中心方法在建模全局结构时未能充分利用局部相似性信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于成对的方法在保持局部相似性关系方面有效，而基于中心的方法通过更好地捕捉全局数据分布通常获得更优性能。然而，基于中心方法在建模全局结构时的优势往往以未能充分利用重要局部相似性信息为代价。

Method: MLH框架包含两个分支：一个强的基于中心的分支和一个较弱的基于成对的分支。通过迭代的相互学习过程，基于中心的分支利用基于成对分支学到的局部相似性线索。此外，受混合专家范式启发，引入了一个新颖的混合哈希专家模块，实现有效的跨分支交互。

Result: 大量实验表明，MLH在多个基准数据集上一致优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH通过弱到强的相互学习框架有效结合了基于中心和基于成对方法的优势，在保持全局结构建模能力的同时充分利用了局部相似性信息，显著提升了哈希检索性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter为解决电商图像修复问题提供了有效解决方案，同时贡献了高质量的EcomPaint-100K数据集和标准化基准EcomPaint-Bench，为领域研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Conclusion: ComGS框架有效解决了3D对象-场景合成的关键挑战，在效率和视觉效果方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比例图进行曝光校正平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复；构建9档包围曝光数据集

Result: 实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有单帧方法，能够有效避免重影和运动模糊，在动态场景中表现稳健

Conclusion: 证明了仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量UHDR重建的可行性，为动态场景处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 1. 使用LoCM无监督微调框架适配事件流估计器到特定场景；2. 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3. 采用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略；4. 用事件运动先验指导变形场优化。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场优化，成功解决了低帧率视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅的挑战，为多模态动态场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: GTR-Bench是一个新的地理时空推理基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在大规模摄像头网络中移动目标的地理时空推理能力，填补了现有基准在图像/视频和图形上下文联合推理方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注以自我为中心的视角推理或地理视角推理，但缺乏同时结合图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对自动驾驶、具身AI和通用AI等领域至关重要。

Method: 提出GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在摄像头网络中进行地图和视频之间的多视角切换、非重叠视场的多视频联合推理，以及对未观测时空区域的推断。

Result: 评估了10多个流行VLM，表现最好的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型准确率仅为34.9%，远低于人类表现（78.61%）。分析揭示了当前模型在时空上下文利用不平衡、时序预测能力弱和地图-视频对齐理解不足三大缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了新视角和机会，揭示了当前VLM在地理时空推理方面的显著局限性，并为未来模型改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于微表情识别的双阶段运动表示方法MM-COF和相应的神经网络架构FMANet，通过整合起始-顶点和顶点-偏移两个阶段的运动信息，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法主要使用起始帧到顶点帧的光流，忽略了顶点到偏移阶段的运动信息，这限制了识别性能。

Method: 提出了MM-COF运动表示方法，整合两个阶段的运动动态；设计了FMANet神经网络架构，包含可学习的双阶段分析和幅度调制模块，能够自适应融合运动线索并关注重要面部区域。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM四个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双阶段框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 通过整合房间几何约束，提出的框架能够有效提升360度室内全景深度估计的性能，特别是在处理房间角落和噪声方面表现出色。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

TL;DR: ACAVP提出了一种增强视觉提示表达能力的参数高效微调方法，通过引入仿射变换和颜色变换来提升性能，并结合TrivialAugment数据增强解决过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限和过拟合问题，导致准确率低于其他适配方法。

Method: ACAVP结合三种变换操作：仿射变换创建任务特定提示区域，颜色变换强调任务相关特征，加法变换保持兼容性。同时使用TrivialAugment数据增强防止过拟合。

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最先进准确率，超越线性探测平均准确率，并展现出对分布偏移的优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示方法的性能，同时保持了推理时的最小计算开销。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Method: 提出MMHOI-Net端到端Transformer网络，采用结构化双补丁表示建模物体及其交互，结合动作识别增强交互预测。

Result: 在MMHOI和CORE4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多人物交互建模方面达到最先进性能，在准确性和重建质量方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net框架为下一代人-物交互研究提供了全面测试平台，在复杂交互建模方面取得显著进展。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在大型城市场景中会出现严重的混叠伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在4K高分辨率渲染下，表现为闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘。

Method: 提出两个协同的正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督（通过预滤波图像金字塔强制渲染一致性）和显式尺寸正则化（对3D高斯尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束）。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的实验表明，PrismGS相比CityGaussian获得约1.5 dB的PSNR提升，在4K渲染下保持高质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，能够有效解决3D高斯泼溅在大型城市场景中的渲染质量问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Motivation: 当前方法通常将语义视为在已形成的几何上被动添加的特征，而稀疏视图重建面临几何模糊性挑战。作者认为语义理解应该作为主动指导力量来提升重建质量。

Method: AlignGS框架从2D基础模型中提取丰富的先验知识，通过深度一致性和多面法线正则化等新颖的语义到几何指导机制，对3D表示进行端到端优化。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器能够从有限输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型，验证了语义指导几何重建的有效性。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test

challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过创新的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度限制问题。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: MARC提出了一种基于记忆增强强化学习的token压缩方法，在视频理解任务中仅使用1帧的token就能达到接近基线的准确率，将视觉token减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，多模态模型成为研究热点。但视觉语言模型在处理视频时面临高帧率和长时长带来的巨大计算成本问题。现有的无训练token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: MARC采用检索-压缩策略：1）视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段；2）压缩组相对策略优化框架将教师模型的推理能力蒸馏到学生模型。该方法结合了结构化检索和基于强化学习的蒸馏技术。

Result: 在6个视频基准测试中，MARC仅使用1帧的token就达到了接近基线的准确率，视觉token减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。

Conclusion: MARC展示了在资源受限环境下（如视频问答、监控和自动驾驶）实现高效实时视频理解的潜力，为视频理解任务提供了高效的token压缩解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数量、空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进跨模态对齐能力。

Method: 引入测试时优化和参数化记忆机制，通过布局注意力目标优化新参数，支持流式生成和历史上下文管理。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现优异，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实时实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶技术的发展，不仅需要高保真度的可控视频生成，还需要产生多样且有意义的深度估计等几何信息。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其3D结构和时间动态编码能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量，同时联合训练高斯泼溅解码器进行动态场景重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景，提供有价值的几何信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高质量多视角视频生成与4D场景重建的联合优化，为全面场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，这些场景中的文本通常具有规则字体、单调颜色和有序布局。而动漫场景中的文本风格多样、排列不规则，且容易与复杂视觉元素混淆，现有数据集无法满足动漫文本检测需求。

Method: 构建了包含层次化标注和针对动漫场景的困难负样本的大规模数据集AnimeText，通过跨数据集基准测试评估其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用AnimeText训练的模型在动漫文本检测任务中优于基于现有数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: AnimeText填补了动漫文本检测领域的空白，为动漫场景中的文本检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

Motivation: 降水临近预报对灾害管理、农业、交通等社会需求至关重要，现有非自回归方法存在局限性，需要解决预测时间跨度对模型的影响以及确定性预测的模糊性和分布偏移问题

Method: SimCast：采用短到长期知识蒸馏训练管道和加权MSE损失关注强降雨区域；CasCast：将SimCast集成到扩散模型中，结合概率模型优势

Result: 在SEVIR、HKO-7、MeteoNet三个基准数据集上分别达到0.452、0.474、0.361的CSI分数，显著超越现有方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了降水临近预报的准确性，结合了确定性预测和概率模型的优势，在不增加推理开销的情况下获得改进的预测结果

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过重新定义VAE的潜在空间正则化和高频感知重建，解决了计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD图像修复面临计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡。传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段提出LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建。第二阶段使用HF-LoRA联合训练：编码器LoRA通过高频对齐损失恢复真实细节，解码器LoRA通过感知导向损失合成真实纹理。

Result: 实验表明Latent Harmony在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: 该框架通过两阶段设计和可调参数α实现了灵活保真度-感知权衡，为UHD图像修复提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，在图像隐私分类任务中，当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像隐私这一上下文依赖且具有主观性的任务中，对象标签和抽象标签哪种更适合。对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕获更高层次的上下文信息。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，分析不同标签数量下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息的效用与抽象标签相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 本文研究了低光图像恢复任务中性能与效率的权衡，比较了Transformer模型SwinIR和轻量级CNN的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复和严重噪声抑制是重要挑战，虽然Transformer模型性能领先但计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 对比分析SwinIR Transformer模型和标准轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的表现，重点关注训练效率和模型大小。

Result: SwinIR达到39.03dB PSNR峰值性能，但轻量级CNN在仅10个训练周期后达到37.4dB的竞争性结果，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近最先进水平的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有应用价值。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、低能耗优势，适合便携设备和移动机器人应用，但现有方法未能充分利用其稀疏特性进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 使用图神经网络处理事件相机的稀疏输出，采用中间线基事件表示，结合新颖的偏移向量学习范式和基于置信度的池化策略。

Result: 实现了高频单人2D人体姿态估计，代码已开源。

Conclusion: GraphEnet是首个将图神经网络应用于事件相机人体姿态估计的工作，为资源受限场景下的实时姿态估计提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的组合图像检索方法存在的黑盒问题，这些方法缺乏可解释性，无法理解检索逻辑，且难以遵循复杂的细粒度指令

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，采用三阶段结构化思维链标注流程（描述、推理、结论），通过微调模型生成结构化输出，并将最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中

Result: 在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上取得高度竞争力性能，在领域外CIRCO数据集上表现出卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链实现了检索过程的透明化和性能提升

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: 由于缺乏明确的深度信息，基于相机的感知系统（如3D目标检测）难以生成准确预测。为了解决深度估计中的模糊性问题，需要开发新的协作视觉感知方法。

Method: 提出RayFusion方法，利用协作方的光线占用信息来减少相机光线上的冗余和误报预测。该方法专门针对纯相机协同感知系统设计，通过光线级别的融合来增强检测性能。

Result: 综合实验表明，RayFusion方法在性能上持续优于现有最先进模型，显著推进了协作视觉感知的性能水平。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过光线级别的融合有效解决了相机协同感知中的深度估计模糊问题，为纯相机系统的3D目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的大幅提升，为弱监督脑部异常检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，润色过程不透明，难以适应多样化的用户或图像特定调整需求

Method: 包含视觉评论器识别输入与参考图像差异，以及代码生成器产生可执行代码，采用类似人类多步润色的渐进式增强方式

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现可解释和可控的调整

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且用户可控的图像润色解决方案

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Conclusion: 提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过微调可实现目标区域的高精度分类，层次化方法在多层次分类任务中具有显著优势

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: RedFace数据集填补了学术评估与现实需求之间的差距，为深度伪造检测研究提供了更贴近现实世界的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，亟需可靠的检测机制，但现有方法面临高维时空动态建模和识别违反物理规律的细微异常的挑战

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度统计量量化空间概率梯度与时间密度变化之比，利用预训练扩散模型开发NSG估计器，通过计算测试视频与真实视频NSG特征的最大均值差异作为检测指标

Result: 实验表明NSG-VD在召回率和F1分数上分别比现有最优方法提升16.00%和10.75%

Conclusion: NSG-VD通过物理驱动的检测范式在AI生成视频检测方面表现出卓越性能，为视频真实性验证提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: DarkHash是首个针对深度哈希的无数据后门攻击方法，通过双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，在不访问训练数据的情况下向深度哈希模型植入后门，同时保持原始检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法需要访问训练数据，但在现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题往往无法获取。因此需要开发无需训练数据的后门攻击方法。

Method: 提出阴影后门攻击框架，使用替代数据集仅微调受害者模型的特定层；设计拓扑对齐损失，优化中毒样本及其邻居向目标样本对齐，增强攻击能力。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法，并能抵御主流后门防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据的后门攻击，为深度哈希模型的安全性提出了新的挑战，同时也为防御方法的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的标签细化流程，从嘈杂的多视角预测中生成准确的分割掩码，以解决极端视角下人脸解析数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端视角下的人脸解析由于缺乏标注数据而面临挑战，手动标注成本高且难以规模化。

Method: 通过联合拟合两个3DGS模型（一个用于RGB图像，一个用于初始分割图），利用共享几何实现多视角一致性，从而合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在精炼数据集上微调人脸解析模型后，在挑战性头部姿态上的准确性显著提升，同时保持标准视图下的强性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需真实3D标注且仅使用少量初始图像，即可实现优于现有方法的效果，为人脸解析在真实场景中的鲁棒性提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对CT图像的特定增强技术——随机窗口化，以解决自然图像增强方法在CT图像上应用时忽略HU值物理意义的问题，从而提高肝脏肿瘤分割模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比增强CT在医学诊断和治疗规划中很重要，但现有的深度学习方法通常将自然图像的增强技术直接应用于CT图像，忽视了CT图像中Hounsfield Units（HU）的物理意义，这可能导致伪影和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出随机窗口化增强技术，利用CT图像中HU强度的分布特性，增强模型对对比度变化的鲁棒性，特别是在对比度差或时机不佳的图像上。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的先进方法，显著提高了肝脏肿瘤分割的性能。

Conclusion: 随机窗口化是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够改善模型在具有挑战性图像上的表现，同时避免了传统强度增强方法可能引入的伪影问题。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，包括双向扩散模型的固有延迟和现有自回归方法的局限性，如质量下降和运动伪影问题。

Method: 首先微调基础图像到视频模型支持基本运动控制，然后通过基于轨迹的奖励模型进行强化学习优化，采用自展开机制保持马尔可夫特性，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性加速训练。

Result: 实验表明AR-Drag在仅使用13亿参数的情况下，实现了高视觉保真度和精确运动对齐，相比最先进的运动可控视频扩散模型显著降低了延迟。

Conclusion: AR-Drag通过强化学习增强的自回归方法，成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的质量和延迟问题，为实时视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和视频语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。特别是在视频语言模型中，模型无法对其基础输出提供逻辑一致的重述问题回答，这种现象的原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预该现象的潜在因素。提出Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS)方法，基于注意力差异构建增强目标，增强模型的时间分辨率能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，TCAS方法显著提高了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实该方法确实提高了注意力头的时间区分能力。在一般视频时间定位任务中也取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的瓶颈，通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Motivation: 现有级联视频超分辨率方法主要局限于文本到视频任务，无法利用文本以外的多模态生成条件，而这些条件对于保证多模态视频生成的保真度至关重要。

Method: 基于潜在视频扩散模型，探索了条件注入策略、训练方案和数据混合技术，设计了不同的数据构建和条件利用方法，使模型能够精确利用所有条件类型。

Result: UniMMVSR显著优于现有方法，生成具有更丰富细节和更高多模态条件符合度的视频，并能与基础模型结合实现4K视频的多模态引导生成。

Conclusion: 该框架突破了现有技术的限制，首次实现了多模态引导的4K视频生成，为视频超分辨率领域带来了重要进展。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂对象交叉和精细空间关系时缺乏显式推理过程，纯文本推理或坐标增强推理无法充分表示复杂视觉布局和指导像素级细节生成。

Method: 提出多模态推理编辑框架，采用交替的文本-图像推理链，每个步骤包含文本描述和对应的视觉提示（如位置掩码）。引入多模态深度置信度推理范式，通过奖励模型剪枝低质量推理路径。

Result: 在三个图像编辑基准测试中取得显著改进，发布了首个包含14K高质量编辑示例的CoT-Edit-14K数据集。

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理链将复杂编辑任务分解为相互依赖的子任务，在每个阶段实现更高精度，产生高保真度的编辑结果。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声（如物体不同方向和尺度），现有方法依赖数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力且增加成本。规范化方法假设训练数据对齐，但实际数据集无法满足该假设。

Method: 提出自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设，适用于任意紧致群，并建立了收敛保证。

Result: 在四个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中，该方法一致优于等变和规范化基线，与数据增强方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 该自举算法有效解决了细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差问题，无需对齐训练数据假设，性能优于现有规范化方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Method: 该框架将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号以确保一致变换。同时采用DDPM反演和先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明，InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为同时进行精确对象重定位和语义控制的图像编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Conclusion: FineDual方法通过建模动态层次化交互，能够生成高质量的双人运动，解决了现有方法忽略距离和层次结构的问题

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Conclusion: AdaGC是针对遥感图像单正例多标签学习的有效解决方案，能有效缓解标签噪声过拟合问题。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频带感知的扩散过程成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，实现了语义一致性和区域保护的平衡

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇目标检测方法在存在多个候选物体的模糊场景中容易失败的问题

Method: 联合利用LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言指令和身体指向线索的鲁棒集成

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的参照物检测

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义消解，提升具体参照理解的性能

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，通过3D空间中的曝光场预测来解决高动态范围场景下的3D重建和视图合成问题，在挑战性真实世界数据上实现55%以上的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在处理包含强曝光变化的数据时性能下降，特别是在室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间等真实场景中。

Method: 学习预测每个3D点的最优曝光值的神经场，通过新型神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，实现3D空间中的曝光优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试上达到最先进结果，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快，能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图。

Conclusion: NExF方法能够鲁棒地重建具有挑战性的真实世界场景，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，在3D重建和视图合成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力堆叠和全局查询设计，在四个指代视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指代视频分割中现有方法在局部性和全局性之间平衡不佳，以及计算复杂度随视频长度增加而显著上升的问题。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互，直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个指代视频分割基准上达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能有效提取长程时序上下文信息，显著提升指代视频分割性能，同时控制计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义引导的学习范式，将大规模2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，通过跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略和跨模态可操作分割Transformer(CAST)架构，在3D可操作分割任务上实现了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D可操作分割方法通常使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽略了3D数据固有的挑战（如稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 1. 提出跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性目标；2. 设计跨模态可操作分割Transformer(CAST)，整合多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征，生成精确的提示感知分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D可操作分割任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，有效解决了3D数据特征学习的语义一致性问题，为3D可操作分割提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的数据无关后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来加速视频扩散模型，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，因为自注意力机制具有二次复杂度。线性注意力虽然能降低成本，但完全替换二次注意力需要昂贵的预训练，且线性注意力的表达能力有限。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择建模为二元分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配（ADM）目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍的速度提升，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍的延迟减少，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型的计算效率问题，通过智能层选择和高效的分布匹配目标，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是对远距离物体的感知，但现有模型在长距离感知方面存在不足。

Method: 创建DTPQA基准测试，排除需要推理的问题，专注于纯感知任务，并评估多个最先进的小型VLM模型。

Result: 最佳小型VLM的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类约85%的表现，特别是在左右区分等任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: 小型VLM在交通场景感知任务上仍有显著差距，特别是在长距离感知方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Conclusion: 该方法的关键优势在于其简单性，仅需几行MATLAB代码即可实现，为图像增强提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

Motivation: 新一代高光谱卫星传感器结合深度学习方法能够实现精细土地覆盖分类，但小样本数据集训练深度网络容易导致过拟合，需要有效的数据增强技术。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型进行数据增强，配合轻量级Transformer网络捕获数据复杂模式，采用改进的加权损失函数和余弦方差调度器实现小数据集上的快速有效训练。

Result: 在PRISMA卫星获取的10种森林类型高光谱图像分类任务中，该方法在平均精度和加权平均精度上均优于其他数据增强技术，且训练过程稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度生成模型在数据增强实际应用中的常见限制，为小样本高光谱图像分类提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

TL;DR: UniVideo是一个统一的多模态视频生成和编辑框架，通过双流设计（MLLM用于指令理解，MMDiT用于视频生成）实现多任务统一训练，在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，视频领域的统一建模研究相对不足。UniVideo旨在将统一建模扩展到视频领域，解决复杂多模态指令的准确理解和视觉一致性的保持问题。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型（MLLM）负责指令理解，多模态DiT（MMDiT）负责视频生成。通过联合训练统一处理多种视频生成和编辑任务，支持任务组合和从图像编辑数据到视频编辑的迁移学习。

Result: 实验表明UniVideo在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越现有最佳方法。模型支持任务组合（如编辑与风格迁移结合）和零样本视频编辑能力（如绿幕抠图、材质替换）。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一多模态建模扩展到视频领域，展示了任务组合和迁移学习的能力，为视频生成和编辑提供了统一的解决方案，并支持基于视觉提示的视频生成。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，用于自动检测和链接历史地图图例中的符号与描述，通过结构化JSON提示实现了88%的F-1分数和85%的IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释地图符号至关重要，但其布局不一致和格式非结构化使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号和描述。

Method: 结合LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，通过边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Result: 实验显示，使用结构化JSON提示的GPT-4优于基线方法，达到88%的F-1分数和85%的IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签精炼，忽略了学习过程。医学图像领域对数据隐私和安全有严格要求，需要一种既能保护隐私又能实现渐进式知识迁移的方法。

Method: 提出LFC框架，包含易到难课程（从简单样本开始学习，逐步增加难度）和源到目标课程（确保模型从源域到目标域的平滑迁移），在无源数据条件下进行模型自适应。

Result: 在眼底图像分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，特别适用于医学图像处理场景，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估最先进T2V模型时存在三个主要问题：1）当前评估维度无法区分顶级模型；2）事件级时间因果关系研究不足；3）缺乏对世界知识的系统评估。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取具有时间因果关系的事件级描述，由独立注释者重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个维度的二元评估问题，开发基于视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐QA评估流程。

Result: 构建了包含300个精心策划提示、815个事件和793个二元评估问题的VideoVerse基准，并对开源和闭源T2V模型进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: VideoVerse为评估T2V模型的世界模型能力提供了全面基准，揭示了当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏技术扩展到大规模应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型（rCM），解决了sCM在细节生成中的质量问题，实现了15-50倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续时间一致性模型（sCM）在学术规模扩散加速方面具有理论优势和实证效果，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性存在基础设施挑战（JVP计算）和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，支持超过100亿参数模型训练；提出分数正则化连续时间一致性模型（rCM），通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则化器，结合前向散度的模式覆盖和反向散度的模式寻求特性。

Result: 在高达140亿参数和5秒视频的大规模模型上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本，加速15-50倍。

Conclusion: rCM作为实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Motivation: 视觉强化学习代理需要从高维图像数据中学习，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制，通过回报差异引导的自监督信号进行训练。核心思想是：如果两个相似表示产生不同结果，它们的区分特征很可能是任务相关的。使用基于回报差异的对比学习三元组训练注意力机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，实现了最高2.4倍的样本效率提升，并能解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的中央凹注意力机制能有效识别任务相关特征，显著提高视觉强化学习的样本效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个模块化空间图像处理框架，集成了灰度量化、色彩增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取等功能，在多样化数据集上展现出稳健且确定性的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够同时处理多个图像处理任务，为实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用提供高效解决方案。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括八级灰度量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间直方图均衡化、HSV亮度调整、3×3卷积核锐化、双向变换管道（包含非锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大）以及几何特征提取（Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等）。

Result: 双向变换管道正向和反向处理准确率分别为76.10%和74.80%，球杆隔离与真实图像的相似度达到81.87%，Hough线估计能够准确检测51.50°的球杆对齐角度。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化数据集上表现出稳健性能，证明了其在实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

TL;DR: Video-STAR是一个用于开放词汇动作识别（OVAR）的框架，通过结合上下文子运动分解和工具增强强化学习，解决多模态大语言模型在开放词汇场景中区分语义相似动作的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉和文本推理方面表现出色，但依赖文本中心先验限制了其在开放词汇场景中区分语义相似动作的能力。

Method: 创新性地将动作分解为可区分的子运动进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交织，通过分层奖励平衡工具使用效率、子运动相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR验证了优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力，实现了从文本中心推理到视觉基础推理的转变。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视觉象似性挑战，这是一个基于视频的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性理解方面的能力，发现当前模型在语音形式预测、透明度和象似性评分方面仍远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义之间的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，但当前视觉语言模型需要从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射关系。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：语音形式预测、透明度和分级象似性评分。

Result: 在语音形式预测任务中，模型能恢复部分手形和位置细节但仍低于人类表现；在透明度任务中远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关。有趣的是，语音形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 这些诊断任务验证了人类中心信号和具身学习方法对于建模象似性和改进多模态模型视觉基础的重要性。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现实世界视频存在多种复杂退化问题（噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真等），现有方法需要手动选择专业模型或采用单一架构难以泛化处理不同退化类型。

Method: 提出MoA-VR系统，包含三个智能体：基于视觉语言模型的退化识别器、基于大语言模型的自适应路由器、以及专门设计的视频质量评估模型。系统模拟人类专业修复流程，通过协同工作处理复杂退化。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能够有效处理多样化和复合退化问题，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的潜力，为复杂视频退化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中ViT注意力汇聚点（ViT attention sinks）的重要作用，发现这些高范数视觉token包含高层次语义信息，并提出方法来更好地利用这些token以提升视觉推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇聚点，但忽视了ViT编码器中高范数视觉token的重要性。这些ViT汇聚点包含关键语义信息，对LVLMs的理解和推理能力有重要影响。

Method: 通过定性和定量分析ViT汇聚点中的信息，提出训练无关和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些token，并探索LLM如何解释这些信息。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT汇聚点token，在一系列LVLMs和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇聚点在增强视觉推理方面具有巨大潜力，现有LVLM架构往往忽视了这些重要token的价值。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Motivation: 解决多智能体机器人系统中3D点云数据传输面临的带宽限制和间歇性连接问题，提高系统性能。

Method: 将点云分解为语义一致的补丁，使用语义感知编码器（基于FiLM条件调制）编码为紧凑潜在表示，通过基于折叠的解码器进行重构。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了点云数据传输的挑战，支持多机器人系统的先进感知应用，性能与原始LiDAR扫描相当。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Method: 提出了Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis理论框架，包含频谱平衡和任务能量两个关键现象。基于此开发了SliceFine方法，仅更新原始权重的选定切片，不引入新参数。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到了与最先进PEFT方法相当的性能，同时显著提升了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 本研究连接了理论与实践，为大规模模型的参数高效微调提供了理论依据，并提出了一种无需新参数的实用替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在精确控制点运动轨迹方面存在局限性，需要一种统一的点基运动表示方法来支持密集和稀疏轨迹控制。

Method: FlexTraj采用统一的点基运动表示，包含分割ID、时间一致轨迹ID和可选颜色通道；使用序列拼接方案而非标记拼接或ControlNet；采用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj能够实现多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj框架在轨迹控制精度、收敛速度和推理效率方面表现出色，为灵活的视频生成控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Motivation: 现有方法试图直接学习空间推理，而没有建立感知和理解的层次基础，导致空间推理能力有限。

Method: 构建了SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，包含26,610个样本；设计了三个阶段渐进训练框架：1)通过物体定位建立空间感知；2)通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；3)通过可验证奖励的强化学习强化复杂推理。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 传统的基于文本指令的图像编辑方法缺乏对编辑程度的精细控制，限制了用户对编辑效果的精确调整。

Method: 扩展现有图像编辑模型，增加标量编辑强度输入；训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型的调制空间系数；使用生成模型合成图像-编辑-指令-强度四元组数据集进行训练。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext提供了一种统一的细粒度编辑强度控制方法，无需特定属性训练即可实现从细微到强烈的多样化编辑操作。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化差异，基于言语行为理论标注规范遵守和违反情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础认知能力，但目前缺乏合适的评测基准。

Method: 采用人机协作框架，教师模型基于理论指导生成候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注，构建包含规范遵守/违反标签及言语/非言语证据的数据集。

Result: 评测发现模型在规范违反识别上表现较差；对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；非言语证据识别困难；正式非幽默场景表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为填补这一空白提供了开端。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一框架，结合了前馈模型的效率和SLAM管道的可靠性，用于单目图像序列的实时3D重建，在保持交互性能的同时提供接近逐场景优化的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在单目图像序列实时3D重建中的权衡问题：逐场景优化方法计算昂贵但保真度高，而前馈基础模型可实现实时推理但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯；设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略，提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能、与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，既能保持准确几何结构，又能提供高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索方法，用于视觉语言导航任务，通过预测未来状态作为查询来选择性检索相关记忆，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的记忆持久性VLN方法存在两个关键局限：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制（要么全量记忆整合，要么固定窗口查找），以及主要存储环境观察而忽略了包含宝贵决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: Memoir包含三个核心组件：1）语言条件化的世界模型，想象未来状态作为检索查询；2）混合视角级记忆，同时存储观察和行为模式；3）经验增强的导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索到的知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的评估中，Memoir在所有场景均取得显著改进，在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 结果表明，预测性检索环境和行为记忆能够实现更有效的导航，分析显示该想象力引导范式仍有很大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: VideoCanvas是一个新型框架，用于实现任意时空视频补全任务，通过零参数增加的上下文条件化范式，解决了现代潜在视频扩散模型中因果VAE引入的时间模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成任务（如图像到视频、修复、扩展和插值）缺乏统一的灵活范式，且现代潜在视频扩散模型因因果VAE的时间模糊性难以实现精确的帧级控制。

Method: 采用混合条件化策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间控制通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配潜在序列中的连续分数位置，从而在冻结骨干网络上实现像素帧感知控制。

Result: 实验表明，VideoCanvas在现有条件化范式中显著优于其他方法，在灵活统一的视频生成方面建立了新的技术水准。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas通过解决时间模糊性问题，成功实现了任意时空视频补全，为多种可控视频生成任务提供了统一的框架，并在基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Motivation: 当前视频基准测试主要针对一般场景，依赖感知/识别能力且推理任务相对简单，无法有效评估高级多模态认知技能，特别是在科学领域的复杂视频推理存在明显差距。

Method: 开发了SciVideoBench基准测试，包含1000个精心设计的多选题，源自前沿科学实验视频，采用半自动验证系统确保质量。每个问题需要领域专业知识、精确时空感知和复杂逻辑推理。

Result: 评估显示包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5-VL在内的先进专有和开源LMMs在科学视频推理方面存在显著性能缺陷，表明视频推理能力仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench为LMMs的未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力的多模态AI科学助手的演进，有助于推动前沿AI在更广泛科学领域的边界。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成大型、复杂或精细的运动，缺乏对中间帧细节的精细控制，无法满足用户多样化的创作意图

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构，将运动控制映射为统一的基于点的稀疏表示，将内容控制和运动控制分离为两个分支，采用分阶段训练策略

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，多模态控制能够实现更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事

Conclusion: 该框架在灵活性、易用性和精细控制之间取得了平衡，为视频编辑和长视频合成提供了强大工具

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: ResAD是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过归一化残差轨迹建模解决轨迹数据时空不平衡问题，将学习任务重新定义为预测相对于确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用点归一化优化目标，在NAVSIM基准上达到88.6的PDMS分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据时空不平衡的根本挑战，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测，从而危及即时安全。

Method: 提出ResAD框架：1）预测相对于确定性惯性参考的残差偏差而非直接预测未来轨迹；2）使用点归一化对预测残差进行优化目标重加权，防止大误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD仅使用两步去噪的普通扩散策略就达到了88.6的PDMS分数，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过简化学习任务显著提高了模型性能，证明了该框架在解决轨迹数据时空不平衡问题上的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NaViL的原生多模态大语言模型（MLLM），通过端到端训练方式系统研究了MLLM的设计空间和扩展特性，发现视觉编码器与LLM之间存在正相关的扩展关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM通常采用组合式训练范式，但这种分离训练方式难以探索多模态扩展特性。本文旨在研究原生端到端训练的MLLM，在数据受限的实际场景下探索其设计空间和扩展规律。

Method: 系统研究MLLM的各种设计选择，获得平衡性能和训练成本的最佳元架构。基于发现的正相关扩展关系，提出简单的NaViL模型和成本效益高的训练方法。

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL表现出与现有MLLM竞争的性能。实验证实了视觉编码器与LLM之间的正相关扩展关系。

Conclusion: NaViL模型证明了原生MLLM的可行性，研究结果为未来原生MLLM的研究提供了深入见解，特别是关于多模态扩展特性的新发现。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Motivation: 稀疏视图条件下3DGS存在性能退化和不稳定性问题，具体表现为相机附近高斯密度过高的区域过拟合，以及远处高斯覆盖不足的区域欠拟合。

Method: 提出D²GS框架，包含两个关键组件：1）深度-密度引导的dropout策略，基于密度和深度自适应地掩码冗余高斯来抑制过拟合；2）距离感知保真度增强模块，通过针对性监督改善远场区域的欠拟合重建质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图条件下显著提高了视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D²GS有效解决了稀疏视图3DGS的过拟合和欠拟合问题，并提出了新的评估指标来量化学习高斯分布的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Result: 在Agent-X、GTA、GAIA三个基准测试中，MATRIX均优于开源和闭源VLM

Conclusion: MATRIX展示了可扩展且有效的多模态工具使用能力

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯泼溅模型，通过迭代细化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新，实现了在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯泼溅模型在推理时仅依赖单次前向传播，性能受到根本限制。为了解决这一问题，需要开发能够迭代优化高斯表示的方法。

Method: 提出ReSplat模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导循环网络学习有效的高斯更新。引入紧凑重建模型在16倍降采样空间初始化循环过程，产生比之前每像素高斯模型少16倍的高斯数量。

Result: 在多种输入视图（2、8、16）、分辨率（256×256到540×960）和数据集（DL3DV和RealEstate10K）上的实验表明，该方法在显著减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制有效解决了前馈高斯泼溅模型的性能限制，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的泛化能力和渲染质量。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA是一个新的视觉-语言-动作模型框架，通过课程训练和高效推理机制，解决了现有VLA模型在隐含人类意图推理方面的不足，显著提升了复杂人机交互的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的VLA模型主要在通用多模态任务上预训练，然后微调以映射显式指令到动作，缺乏推理密集型预训练和推理引导的操控能力，无法处理复杂现实交互中所需的隐含人类意图推理。

Method: 提出IntentionVLA框架，首先使用精心设计的推理数据进行预训练，结合意图推断、空间定位和紧凑的具身推理，赋予模型推理和感知能力；然后在微调阶段使用紧凑推理输出作为动作生成的上下文指导，实现间接指令下的快速推理。

Result: IntentionVLA大幅超越基线模型π0，在直接指令下成功率提高18%，在意图指令下比ECoT高28%。在分布外意图任务上，IntentionVLA的成功率是基线模型的两倍以上，并实现了40%成功率的零样本人机交互。

Conclusion: IntentionVLA作为下一代人机交互系统的有前景范式，通过增强推理能力显著提升了复杂交互场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a

TL;DR: 本文介绍了参加IROS 2025 RoboSense挑战赛社会导航赛道的技术方案，通过在Falcon模型基础上引入主动风险感知模块，提升了自主代理在动态人群环境中的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战赛要求开发基于RGBD感知的导航系统，使自主代理能够在动态人类环境中安全、高效且符合社会规范地导航，仅使用机载传感器且无法访问全局地图。

Method: 在Falcon模型基础上提出主动风险感知模块，通过学习预测周围人类的距离碰撞风险评分，增强代理的空间感知能力和主动避碰行为。

Result: 在Social-HM3D基准测试中，该方法显著提升了代理在拥挤室内场景中维持个人空间合规性的能力，在16支参赛队伍中获得第2名。

Conclusion: 主动风险感知模块有效增强了社会导航性能，证明了基于距离碰撞风险预测的方法在动态人类环境导航中的实用价值。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

Conclusion: R2RGen是一个高效且即插即用的真实世界数据生成框架，有效解决了机器人操作中的空间泛化问题。

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了前所未有的通用性，为机器人灵巧操作提供了有效的模拟到现实转换解决方案，并通过远程操作应用验证了其实际价值。

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶等机器人系统的感知规划模型主要通过离线评估进行验证，但离线性能与在线实际表现之间的相关性较差，这导致难以准确预测模型在真实环境中的表现。

Method: 通过大量仿真实验分析离线与在线评估的相关性，并研究基于认知不确定性的离线指标，该指标旨在捕捉可能导致闭环设置中错误的事件。

Conclusion: 当前自动驾驶策略的评估实践和指标存在有效性疑问，基于认知不确定性的离线指标能够有效缩小离线与在线评估之间的差距，为更可靠的政策评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了将课程学习与基于扩散的合成增强相结合能否提高胸部X光片中难以检测的肺结节的检测能力，特别是那些尺寸小、亮度低、对比度差的结节，这些结节由于数据不平衡和标注有限常常挑战传统AI模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI模型在检测尺寸小、亮度低、对比度差的肺结节时面临的挑战，这些结节由于数据不平衡和有限标注而难以检测。

Method: 使用带有特征金字塔网络（FPN）主干的Faster R-CNN，在包含专家标注的NODE21、VinDr-CXR、CheXpert和11,206张DDPM生成的合成图像的混合数据集上进行训练。基于尺寸、亮度和对比度的难度分数指导课程学习。

Result: 课程学习模型的平均AUC为0.95，基线为0.89（p < 0.001），敏感性（70% vs. 48%）和准确率（82% vs. 70%）均有提升。分层分析显示在所有难度级别（从容易到非常困难）上均有一致的改进。

Conclusion: 课程指导的合成增强提高了肺结节检测模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

TL;DR: SatFusion是一个统一的卫星物联网图像增强框架，通过多时相和多源数据融合来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字社会的快速发展，卫星物联网中卫星数量的激增导致了大尺度多时相多源图像的积累。现有方法无法充分利用时相和源维度中的互补信息，例如MISR方法受限于输入图像的细粒度纹理细节，而pansharpening方法对噪声和配准误差敏感。

Method: SatFusion框架包含三个模块：多时相图像融合模块实现与全色图像的深度特征对齐；多源图像融合模块注入全色数据的细粒度纹理信息；融合组合模块自适应整合两种模态的互补优势，同时动态优化光谱一致性，通过多个损失函数的加权组合进行监督。

Conclusion: SatFusion是一个有效的卫星图像增强框架，能够充分利用多时相和多源数据的互补信息，为卫星物联网应用提供了高质量的图像融合解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion
quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to
real-world Sat-IoT scenarios. The code is available at:

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

TL;DR: DUA-D2C在Divide2Conquer方法基础上，通过动态不确定性感知聚合来改进模型集成，有效对抗深度学习中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准D2C方法在聚合子集模型时采用等权重或固定启发式策略，未能充分利用各子集模型的不同泛化能力，限制了对抗过拟合的效果。

Method: 提出DUA-D2C方法，基于共享验证集上的性能动态加权子集模型的贡献，同时考虑准确率和预测不确定性，使中心模型优先学习泛化能力更强的子集模型。

Result: 在多领域基准数据集上的实证评估表明，DUA-D2C显著提高了泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法基础上应用也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一种理论上有依据且有效的对抗现代深度学习中过拟合问题的方法，通过智能聚合机制提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Conclusion: MultiFair通过双层级梯度调制有效解决了多模态医疗分类中的模态不平衡和群体不公平问题

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成高质量CUDA内核数据集的管道ConCuR，并开发了KernelCoder模型，在GPU内核生成任务中显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核生成面临高质量数据稀缺的挑战，因为大多数高质量内核都是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了通过监督微调使LLM适应内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核及推理轨迹的管道，构建了ConCuR数据集，并训练了KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，模型显著优于现有顶级模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有开源内核生成微调模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该研究为未来获得更好的内核生成数据提供了观察、指标和数据收集管道。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个利用多模态大语言模型进行时间序列分析的新框架，通过视觉表示来增强对复杂时间依赖性和跨通道交互的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据分析面临复杂时间依赖和跨通道交互的挑战。受人类视觉检查时间序列的启发，研究探索是否可以通过视觉表示来增强自动化时间序列分析。

Method: 提出MLLM4TS框架，将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，采用时间感知视觉补丁对齐策略，将视觉补丁与对应时间片段对齐，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型相结合，实现稳健且可泛化的时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MMM框架，通过整合三维量子化学信息来改进药物相互作用预测，相比传统GNN方法在多个指标上取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN方法使用简化的离散形式无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，药物相互作用风险预测存在挑战

Method: MMM框架：使用ELF生成3D电子密度图，结合ELF特征（全局电子特性）和二分图编码器（局部子结构相互作用）来学习药物分子的互补特性

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，相比SafeDrug模型，F1-score、Jaccard和DDI率均有统计学显著改善（p值分别为0.0387、0.0112、0.0386）

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示具有增强预测准确性的潜力，可为临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方提供支持

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Method: 提出双粒度Sinkhorn蒸馏(D-SINK)框架，使用最优传输优化的代理标签分配，将目标模型的样本级预测与噪声鲁棒辅助模型对齐，类别分布与不平衡鲁棒辅助模型对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在长尾噪声数据学习上取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用专门处理单一问题的弱辅助模型的互补优势，可以有效解决类别不平衡和标签噪声的共存挑战，而无需开发复杂的新技术。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

TL;DR: 该研究测试了不同深度学习超分辨率模型，用于牙本质孔隙网络的成像，通过生物学驱动的评估方法验证模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共聚焦显微镜的高分辨率成像限制了视野范围，需要开发更快速的低分辨率成像和超分辨率后处理技术来研究牙本质的亚微观孔隙结构。

Method: 使用三种有监督的2D超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN）和一种无监督模型（CycleGAN），在实验配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像上进行测试，像素尺寸增加2倍、4倍、8倍。

Result: 标准图像质量评估指标与视觉感知结果不一致，而基于孔隙网络结构和连通性的生物学驱动评估方法能更好地解释超分辨率模型的性能差异。

Conclusion: 标准图像质量评估指标不适用于评估牙本质孔隙结构的超分辨率成像效果，需要开发针对特定生物学结构的评估方法。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在扩散模型中应用存在挑战，因为最有效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE，而GRPO需要随机策略。现有解决方案使用低效的SDE采样器引入随机性，但收敛速度慢。

Method: 提出DGPO算法，完全摆脱策略梯度框架，直接从组级偏好中学习，利用组内样本的相对信息。这种设计消除了对低效随机策略的需求，可以使用高效的确定性ODE采样器。

Result: 实验结果显示，DGPO比现有最先进方法训练速度快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上都取得了更优的性能。

Conclusion: DGPO通过创新的组级偏好学习机制，成功解决了扩散模型中强化学习应用的效率问题，为扩散模型的优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习严重依赖配对数据集，但能否利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表示学习是一个被忽视但潜力巨大的问题。

Method: 提出UML：未配对多模态学习器，通过共享参数的单一模型交替处理不同模态的输入，利用不同模态是共享现实投影的假设，实现跨模态结构学习。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下证明未配对辅助数据能产生比单模态训练更具信息量的表示；实验表明使用文本、音频或图像等未配对数据能持续提升图像和音频等单模态目标的下游性能。

Conclusion: UML范式有效证明了未配对多模态数据在增强单模态表示学习方面的潜力，为多模态学习提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

Conclusion: 该表示方法直接提升了表示效率，无需复杂控制框架，在实时渲染和表达能力之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对颜色、材质、几何和光照的精确控制能力，需要一种能够通过内在通道和多模态输入实现直观视频编辑的方法。

Method: 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频生成，采用混合自注意力确保时间一致性，使用掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示，开发递归采样方法生成长视频。

Conclusion: X2Video为基于内在通道的视频生成和编辑提供了有效解决方案，支持复杂的多模态控制，在视频生成质量和控制精度方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Motivation: 现有评估方法系统性地低估了AI模型在组合推理任务上的真实能力，需要更准确的评估指标

Method: 引入群组匹配分数评估方法，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法进行自我改进

Result: 新方法使SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在多个基准测试中创下新纪录，相对提升最高达85.7%

Conclusion: TTM算法能持续提升模型性能，推动组合推理能力的前沿发展

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序学习新技能时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，探索如何在保持原有能力的同时有效学习新技能。

Method: 在三个模型家族上对五个目标技能进行顺序微调，同时监控八个保留基准测试的通用能力。通过输出标记分布分析遗忘现象，并提出两种调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层并冻结Down投影层。

Result: 发现微调后的遗忘现象部分可在后续阶段恢复；提出的两种调优方法在多个模型和任务上均能实现强目标增益，同时基本保留原有性能。

Conclusion: 通过限制参数更新的范围（特定层调优），可以有效平衡新技能学习和原有能力保持，为LMMs的持续学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing
tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise,
are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our
model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators
for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.
FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis,
offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.
