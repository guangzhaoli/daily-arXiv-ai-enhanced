### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResPA是一种新的对抗攻击方法，通过残差梯度引导对抗样本朝向损失函数的平坦区域，提高了迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性有限。

Method: 利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，结合历史梯度方向，捕捉全局扰动变化。

Result: 实验证明ResPA比现有方法具有更好的迁移性，且与输入变换方法结合可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型泛化能力，解决了现有方法在开放世界中泛化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限，容易过拟合，导致泛化能力不足，性能不稳定。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型通用知识，并通过知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制动态调整通用知识指导。

Result: 实验证明GOOD在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新型方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定知识的精确去除，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害或误导性内容，因此需要有效的机器遗忘方法，去除特定知识而不影响整体性能。

Method: UnGuide利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)动态调整引导尺度，结合LoRA适配器，选择性去除目标概念。

Result: UnGuide在对象擦除和显式内容去除任务中表现优于现有基于LoRA的方法，同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide通过动态控制机制实现了精确的机器遗忘，解决了LoRA方法在无关内容上的副作用问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法在区域选择上的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理特定区域，但会导致风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络，结合内部混合技术，精确地对感兴趣区域进行风格迁移。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了该方法在视觉和量化指标上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了区域风格迁移的准确性和视觉效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的局限性，包括泛化性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，可用于数据增强。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在医学图像合成中表现出色，代码和模型已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和混合架构，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的脑成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺的问题，提升预训练变换器在真实世界中的适用性。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上学习可迁移的潜在表示，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet进行分类和分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别中达到最先进精度，在分割任务中优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架在低资源临床环境中具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于广泛的神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构并插值实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条或特征提取网络，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面的图结构，应用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 实现了快速风格化（2分钟内），支持任意风格图像和样条，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 该方法高效灵活，适用于多种3D高斯样条风格迁移任务。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，显著提升了工业检测中的细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节，且多缩放图像会破坏多视角一致性。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放因子和新的位姿策略，先解决广角图像位姿，再通过裁剪匹配处理缩放图像。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著提升了PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标。

Conclusion: MZEN扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，兼顾全局精度和微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中复杂的运动动态和内存冗余限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用，TSMS-SAM2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，以提高对运动变化的鲁棒性和内存效率。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的平均Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、鲁棒的分割能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [10] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有token剪枝方法因窗口注意力机制受限，且未充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA策略，通过时间相关性优化token聚类，保留细节同时减少计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA提升了现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现出色，是一种高效且无需微调的优化方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，通过自然语言描述驾驶员的注视行为，支持少样本和零样本学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像的注意力分配，而本文旨在通过自然语言动态描述驾驶员的注视变化，提升可解释性。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化，并微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文信息（如路线语义、风险预测）。

Result: 微调后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，支持少样本和单样本学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，适用于行为预测、人机协作等下游任务。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [12] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角方法在面部遮挡、目标模糊和视线外目标等问题上的局限性。

Method: 结合头部信息聚合（HIA）、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块。

Result: 显著优于单视角基线方法，尤其在第二视角提供清晰面部视图时。

Conclusion: 多视角方法在GTE任务中表现优越，并具备单视角不具备的能力，同时发布了多视角数据集。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新模块和自适应集成模块提升CLIP模型在分布变化下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布变化下泛化能力不足。现有的基于缓存的测试时适应方法仅存储高置信度样本，限制了决策边界的优化。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并通过自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有测试时适应模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑，能生成多样风格的高质量场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析场景需求，通过3D生成模型创建高质量资产，并应用空间约束实现语义和物理合理的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0在室内和开放域场景中均优于基线，支持布局和风格一致的编辑。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在游戏建模等应用中能高效生成沉浸式环境。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且未充分利用预训练多模态LLM的能力，Bifrost-1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并保留多模态LLM的推理能力。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Bifrost-1通过高效整合预训练模型，实现了高质量图像生成，验证了设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Result: 在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注水平，实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画集成的关键问题。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Motivation: 深度补全模型在从源数据转移到目标数据时，由于协变量偏移会导致预测错误。现有方法缺乏对目标数据的先验知识，因此需要一种无需假设目标分布的方法。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型和测试时适应，有效解决了深度补全模型在目标数据上的协变量偏移问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该系统在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法在面部化妆编辑中常因缺乏结构化配对数据而导致低质量结果，无法同时保持身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，并提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏迭代提升数据和模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实世界基准测试中表现优于现有方法，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保持方面表现优异，平衡了二者，代码和数据集将在接受后发布。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Motivation: 旨在通过保留关键内容并紧密遵循文本指令，实现快速且高质量的图像编辑。

Method: 结合PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术和Disentangled Prompt Guidance，并集成Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上表现优于现有方法，速度快且质量高。

Conclusion: InstantEdit在速度和编辑效果上均优于现有方法，适用于高效图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉特征，显著降低计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉特征的高维度导致计算开销大，现有方法在减少特征数量时往往牺牲性能或增加额外成本。

Method: 利用视觉特征在低频能量集中的特性，通过二维离散余弦变换（DCT）进行低通滤波压缩。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上具有显著优势，适用于多种视觉语言模型架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自回归图像生成的Next Editing-token Prediction（NEP）方法，仅重新生成需要编辑的区域，避免了不必要的计算成本和未编辑区域的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且未编辑区域的重建偏差影响编辑质量。

Method: 提出NEP方法，预训练一个任意顺序自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，支持零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新最优性能，并支持零样本迭代优化。

Conclusion: NEP方法通过选择性编辑区域，显著提升了图像编辑的效率和质量。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用多模态模型和强化学习解决泛化性和可解释性问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在泛化性和可解释性上表现不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性）进行视频质量评分和理解。

Result: 在域内和OOD基准测试中表现最优，且在质量描述和失真归因任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖评分监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: LV-Net为侧脑室形状分析提供了更可靠的工具，有助于神经系统疾病的研究。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，由于事件像素缺乏颜色信息，导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克任务，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM指标优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低了1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SOD和COD任务联合学习会降低性能，但本文提出相反观点，认为通过正确方法可以实现双赢。

Method: 提出SCJoint方案，通过任务特定的学习参数和共享网络结构解耦任务矛盾；引入SBSS策略平衡训练集。

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时处理SOD和COD任务，性能优异。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS有效解决了SOD和COD任务的联合学习问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Motivation: 当前基准测试无法提供直观的性能差异反馈，BioMotion Arena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用成对比较评估方法，收集了53个主流模型在90种生物运动变体上的45k+投票。

Result: 数据显示众包投票与专家评分一致，且90%以上模型无法生成基本的人形点光源运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准测试框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，可生成亚毫米级3D形态，适用于术前和术中规划。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，并通过生成模型数据微调提升了属性编辑能力。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一图像和视频编辑、多样化数据合成和高效框架，显著提升了指令编辑的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有的视频生成模型在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影，需要一种更稳定的蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出连续时间一致性蒸馏和双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）来优化蒸馏过程。

Result: 在 OpenVid-1M 基准测试中，SwiftVideo 在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo 提供了一种高效且稳定的蒸馏框架，能够在减少推理步骤的同时保持视频生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法依赖静态文本提示或注意力模式，未能充分利用推理过程中的动态内部信号，导致效率不足。

Method: 提出动态文本引导剪枝机制和跨模态注意力分析，生成软优先级和高效剪枝计划。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%，且在相同令牌预算下超越SOTA。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，在多模态任务中具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

Motivation: 当前视频质量评估方法依赖大规模预训练，但存在语义知识不足和计算资源消耗大的问题，VLMs的泛化能力为解决方案提供了可能。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入可学习质量提示，并研究帧采样策略对性能的影响。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，帧差采样策略提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为视频质量评估提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于半监督情感先验的扩散模型，用于生成多样化的情感驱动反应动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体动作生成框架未考虑情感影响，导致自然性不足，限制了在交互任务中的应用。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架训练情感先验，并结合空间交互和情感响应训练扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在反应动作生成任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够生成真实的情感驱动反应动作，提升了交互任务的自然性。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成框架UGD-IML，首次将IML和CIML任务统一在一个框架中，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像篡改定位方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集缺乏多样性和规模，且现有CIML方法依赖复杂多阶段流程，效率低下。

Method: 利用扩散模型学习数据分布，减少对标注数据的依赖；通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML模式的无缝切换。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务上的F1指标分别平均提升9.66和4.36。

Conclusion: UGD-IML在性能、不确定估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，为图像篡改定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理噪声标签时容易过拟合，且缺乏跨模态一致性，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: MCA框架包含多模态联合标签校正（MJC）和多级自适应对齐（MAA）策略，分别用于标签修正和特征增强。

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架在噪声标签条件下表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别因二维结构、符号尺度变化和复杂空间关系而具有挑战性，且标注数据昂贵。

Method: 结合全局和局部对比损失预训练图像编码器，设计渐进空间掩码策略的自监督注意力网络，最后用Transformer解码器进行监督微调。

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中优于现有自监督和全监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制有效提升了手写数学表达式识别性能，且无需监督即可学习语义聚焦区域。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

TL;DR: FMCE-Net++是一种新的训练框架，通过整合预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部表示不透明的问题，FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，利用预训练的FMCE-Net生成特征图收敛分数，结合任务标签通过表示辅助损失优化主干网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50在CIFAR-10上准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升现有模型的性能上限，无需修改架构或增加数据。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法因依赖Transformer融合而面临计算复杂度和空间建模不足的问题。

Method: 采用几何增强的LiDAR表示和门控Mamba融合架构（GM-Fusion），替代Transformer，利用状态空间模型（SSM）高效捕获长程依赖。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在自动驾驶中比通用Transformer更具性能和效率优势。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: SynSeg是一种弱监督方法，通过多类别对比学习和特征协同结构，显著提升了开放词汇场景下的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇场景下的语义分割面临语义类别广泛和细粒度的挑战，现有方法因依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构建方法导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出多类别对比学习（MCCL）和特征协同结构（FSS），结合类别内和类别间的对齐与分离，并通过特征重构避免视觉编码器的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督下显著提升了语义定位和区分能力，是开放词汇语义分割的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Motivation: 探索表示学习算法在卫星图像中的应用，以改进天气事件的分类效果。

Method: 使用主成分分析（PCA）、卷积自编码器（CAE）和预训练残差网络（PT）学习潜在空间，并进行分类任务评估。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最佳，PCA命中率高但误报率也高，PT在热带气旋识别中表现优异。高分辨率数据集对深度学习算法效果更好。

Conclusion: CAE在表示学习中表现高效，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息增强的CAE版本。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Method: 利用场景图解析算法分解描述为对象、属性和关系集合，通过集合差异计算奖励，激励准确纠正。

Result: 实验表明，SC-Captioner在多样化场景中生成更优描述，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习框架和精细奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述模型的自我纠正能力。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Motivation: 评估SAM的可转移漏洞对下游应用的影响，解决现有对抗攻击方法跨域性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出VeSCA，通过参数化单纯复形表征共享脆弱区域，并结合轻量级域适应策略。

Result: 在五个领域数据集上，VeSCA性能比现有方法提升12.7%。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Motivation: 现有安全数据集可能因MLLM的快速发展而过时，且易受数据污染影响，因此需要一种动态评估框架来应对这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，SDEval显著影响安全评估，缓解数据污染，并暴露了MLLMs的安全局限性。

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用的动态评估框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，为MLLMs的安全性提供了新的评估方法。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts

cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a

Result: 实验证明DSConv的有效性和先进性能，讨论验证了其优越性和最佳使用条件。

Conclusion: DSConv通过动态分割卷积核和注意力机制，显著提升了全色锐化任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

TL;DR: VISTAR是一个用户中心的多维度文本到图像评估基准，通过混合方法解决现有指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像评估指标存在局限性，VISTAR旨在提供更全面的评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段混合范式：确定性指标评估物理可量化属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。

Result: VISTAR在人类对齐度上表现优异（>75%），HWPQ方案在抽象语义评估中达到85.9%准确率。

Conclusion: VISTAR提供了可复制的评估资源，并揭示了不同模型在不同领域的表现差异。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期诊断因脑部结构变化的复杂性而困难，现有深度学习方法难以捕捉非线性关系。

Method: 提出MPF-KANSC框架，结合多平面融合和KANSC注意力机制，并行提取特征并精确识别异常。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右偏侧皮层下结构不对称的新证据。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC在AD诊断中表现出优越性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Method: 提出PostDiff框架，包括混合分辨率去噪方案（减少早期步骤的分辨率）和模块缓存策略（重用计算）。

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff显著提升了扩散模型的效率-保真度权衡，且降低每步推理成本比减少去噪步骤更有效。

Conclusion: 在保持生成质量的前提下，优化每步推理成本比减少去噪步骤更有效，PostDiff为此提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理建模和自适应修剪，显著提升了水下3D重建的精度和视觉效果。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Conclusion: MA-CBP框架在犯罪预测和公共安全领域具有潜力。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸腔积液CT图像的分割精度，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型在持续视觉指令调优中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调优中，灾难性遗忘导致模型在适应新任务时遗忘旧任务性能，现有方法参数开销大且扩展性差。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A、对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，且参数效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为持续视觉指令调优提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在8个数据集上实验表明，AnomalyMoE显著优于领域专用方法，达到新最优性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家模块，实现了跨领域的通用异常检测，性能卓越。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别与RA进展相关的解剖结构，为临床实践提供了高效且可解释的SvdH评分预测工具。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理和边缘引导机制有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Result: 统一方法在性能上与专用模型相当，并在未见过的模糊场景中表现出显著的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的全合一去模糊方法具有高效性和泛化性，适用于多种模糊类型，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器对未见过的伪造技术泛化能力不足的问题，避免复杂的架构调整。

Method: 仅微调CLIP模型的Layer Normalization参数，并通过L2归一化和潜在空间增强来优化特征流形。

Result: 在13个数据集上表现最优，平均跨数据集AUROC超过其他复杂方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化调整预训练模型，实现了高效且可复现的泛化能力，代码将公开。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类中面临通信开销大的问题，FedX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少传输模型大小。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上验证了FedX能显著减少参数数量并提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX成功减少了通信开销，同时保持了模型性能，优于现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Conclusion: XAG-Net为股骨MRI分割提供了一种高效且准确的框架。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Result: SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态校正和聚焦提示相关区域，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GRPO依赖标注数据且计算开销大，难以在未标注域中实时应用。

Method: 引入URPA，通过GRPO生成多个预测并平均形成伪标签，利用方差估计置信度，加权训练奖励。

Result: 在三个数据集的六种跨域设置中表现良好。

Conclusion: URPA在少量未标注目标视频下泛化能力强，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，主要因缺乏类别特异性建模和弱监督信号不足。

Method: 提出高斯泼溅引导的专家混合模型（GS-MoE），利用多个专家模型分别捕捉特定异常类型，并通过高斯泼溅损失增强时间一致性。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58% AUC，在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性建模和时间引导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致域偏移，限制了AI模型在实际场景中的应用。传统方法如数据增强和迁移学习存在局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成与参考图像相似的合成心脏MR图像，保持空间和结构一致性。评估了在域泛化和域适应策略中的应用。

Result: 在未见目标域数据上，分割性能显著提升（Welch's t-test, p < 0.01），优于仅使用真实数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了心脏MR图像分析中的域偏移问题，减少了对迁移学习或在线训练的依赖，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Result: 模型能在无监督下正确从观测推断状态，适用于更接近现实的3D场景。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型更鲁棒，适用于复杂动态场景，且无需初始真实状态。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本、全球覆盖的数据源可能蕴含潜在社交信息。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型分析2998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交分类理论，并通过线性回归模型控制多种变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与所有社交类型相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社交，地方依恋与短暂社交正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可用于研究社交互动与建成环境的关系，为跨文化理论测试和城市设计提供工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过高效信息处理提升了异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVGen框架通过蒸馏视频扩散模型，显著提高了稀疏视图下3D重建的效率，采样时间减少90%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图在3D重建中会导致未观测区域的伪影，现有方法因视频扩散模型采样速度慢而受限。

Method: 提出FVGen框架，使用GAN和软化反向KL散度最小化，将多步去噪教师模型蒸馏为少步去噪学生模型。

Result: 在真实数据集上，FVGen以更少采样步骤生成相同数量且质量相当（或更好）的新视图，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了下游重建任务的时间效率，尤其在稀疏输入视图（多于2个）时表现突出。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the
Major-to-minor (M2m) method M2m$_f$, M2m$_u$. The algorithms are tested on two
public datasets, OpenSARShip (6 classes) and FuSARShip (9 classes), using three
state-of-the-art models as feature extractors: ViT, VGG16, and ResNet50.
Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Conclusion: 该框架为医学影像提供了一种实用解决方案，能在极少量标注数据下实现鲁棒分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Abstract: Face swapping technology has gained significant attention in both academic
research and commercial applications. This paper presents our implementation
and enhancement of SimSwap, an efficient framework for high fidelity face
swapping. We introduce several improvements to the original model, including
the integration of self and cross-attention mechanisms in the generator
architecture, dynamic loss weighting, and cosine annealing learning rate
scheduling. These enhancements lead to significant improvements in identity
preservation, attribute consistency, and overall visual quality.
  Our experimental results, spanning 400,000 training iterations, demonstrate
progressive improvements in generator and discriminator performance. The
enhanced model achieves better identity similarity, lower FID scores, and
visibly superior qualitative results compared to the baseline. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of each architectural and training improvement. We
conclude by identifying key future directions, such as integrating StyleGAN3,
improving lip synchronization, incorporating 3D facial modeling, and
introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然图像-文本数据集语义对齐松散和医学数据集内容多样性低的问题，以增强CLIP模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin作为即插即用组件，兼容多种对比框架，显著提升多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Motivation: 解决复杂域偏移（如地理偏移）中传统UDA方法的不足，利用语言模态的鲁棒性改进视觉模型的适应能力。

Method: TRUST通过生成伪标签、不确定性估计和多模态软对比学习损失，对齐视觉和语言特征空间。

Result: 在经典（DomainNet）和复杂（GeoNet）域偏移上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态的引导和不确定性估计，显著提升了复杂域偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Text-Swin-UMamba模型在病灶分割任务中表现出色，为临床评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical
assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language
models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the
radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating

Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对精确和及时环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包含特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并通过弱监督策略进行训练。

Result: WGAST平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，并能有效捕捉细尺度热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST在LST估计任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化的图表生成方法以及高质量数据集ECD能够有效提升MLLMs的图表理解能力。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Result: Lightswitch在2D重光照预测质量上超越现有方法，并在合成和真实物体重光照中表现优异。

Conclusion: Lightswitch通过整合固有属性和多视角数据，显著提升了重光照效果和效率。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs

Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or
references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system
that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design
plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system
control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and
convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or
iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes,
differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more
explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative
workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven
interaction in generative design tools.

Result: 在真实训练中实现小于1%的负载差异，消除拖尾效应，训练速度提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: KnapFormer有效解决了负载不平衡问题，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率。

Abstract: We present KnapFormer, an efficient and versatile framework to combine
workload balancing and sequence parallelism in distributed training of
Diffusion Transformers (DiT). KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong
synergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the
significant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from
variable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution
and image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first
gathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and
solving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of
total workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence
parallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the
load-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload
model, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%
workload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length
varying from a few hundred to tens of thousands. It eliminates straggler
effects and achieves 2x to 3x speedup when training state-of-the-art diffusion
models like FLUX on mixed-resolution and image-video joint data corpora. We
open-source the KnapFormer implementation at

Motivation: 现有越狱方法局限于特定提示和图像的扰动，可扩展性差且耗时。

Method: 优化对抗性补丁和安全改写集，绕过安全检查器和提示过滤器。

Result: 在开源和商业T2I模型上表现优异，成功率高出现有方法4倍。

Conclusion: U3-Attack有效解决了现有越狱方法的局限性，展示了多模态攻击的潜力。

Abstract: Various (text) prompt filters and (image) safety checkers have been
implemented to mitigate the misuse of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in creating
Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content.In order to expose potential security
vulnerabilities of such safeguards, multimodal jailbreaks have been
studied.However, existing jailbreaks are limited to prompt-specific and
image-specific perturbations, which suffer from poor scalability and
time-consuming optimization.To address these limitations, we propose
Universally Unfiltered and Unseen (U3)-Attack, a multimodal jailbreak attack
method against T2I safeguards.Specifically, U3-Attack optimizes an adversarial
patch on the image background to universally bypass safety checkers and
optimizes a safe paraphrase set from a sensitive word to universally bypass
prompt filters while eliminating redundant computations.Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our U3-Attack on both open-source and
commercial T2I models.For example, on the commercial Runway-inpainting model
with both prompt filter and safety checker, our U3-Attack achieves $~4\times$
higher success rates than the state-of-the-art multimodal jailbreak attack,

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ATP是一种新型的抗篡改扰动方法，结合保护扰动和授权扰动，有效防御伪造攻击并检测净化篡改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化图像生成技术的发展，伪造攻击侵犯肖像权和隐私的问题日益严重，现有保护扰动算法易被净化技术绕过。

Method: ATP在频域中引入保护扰动和授权扰动，通过掩码指导确保两者互不干扰，授权扰动分布在全图像素以保持对净化篡改的敏感性。

Result: 实验证明ATP在各种攻击场景下均能有效防御伪造攻击。

Conclusion: ATP为保护肖像权和隐私提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns
about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing.
To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been
developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms
would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques
to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,
Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within
the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,
where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the
authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both
protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain
under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does
not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the
authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,
preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates
its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings
through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting
individuals' portrait rights and privacy. Our code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NFH-SEM是一种基于神经场的混合SEM 3D重建方法，通过多视角、多探测器2D SEM图像输入，结合几何和光度信息，实现复杂微结构的精确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D SEM图像无法直接揭示微样品的3D形貌，现有方法在复杂微结构重建中存在离散3D表示、校准需求和阴影梯度误差等挑战。

Method: NFH-SEM采用神经场表示，通过端到端自校准消除手动校准，并在训练中自动分离阴影，结合几何和光度信息。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上验证了NFH-SEM的有效性，能够高保真重建多样复杂样品，如双光子光刻微结构、桃花花粉和碳化硅颗粒表面。

Conclusion: NFH-SEM展示了精确的细节重建和广泛适用性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in
scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional
(2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of
micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction
methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging
for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the
need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient
errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D
reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as
input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural
field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures
through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from
SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate
microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated
datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse,
challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach
pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and
broad applicability.

TL;DR: MammoFormer框架结合Transformer架构和多特征增强技术，提升乳腺癌检测性能并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN在医学图像分析中局部与全局信息处理不足及缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 结合Transformer架构、多特征增强技术和XAI功能，测试七种架构和四种增强技术。

Result: ViT结合AHE达到98.3%准确率，Swin Transformer通过HOG增强提升13%。

Conclusion: MammoFormer通过优化架构和XAI集成，克服了AI乳腺X光系统的临床采用障碍。

Abstract: Breast cancer detection through mammography interpretation remains difficult
because of the minimal nature of abnormalities that experts need to identify
alongside the variable interpretations between readers. The potential of CNNs
for medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both
local information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide
explainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics.
The researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites
transformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and
XAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures
consisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were
tested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images,
negative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of
oriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical
adoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic
optimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature
enhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive
explainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic
interpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN
reliability with transformer global context modeling. The combination of
transformer models with suitable feature enhancements enables them to achieve
equal or better results than CNN approaches. ViT achieves 98.3% accuracy
alongside AHE while Swin Transformer gains a 13.0% advantage through HOG
enhancements

TL;DR: 利用潜在扩散模型（LDM）和ControlNet生成喉镜图像-标注对，解决数据稀缺问题，提升喉部病变检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉镜CADx/e系统因数据稀缺和病变异质性高而受限，活检仍是金标准但成本高。

Method: 结合LDM和ControlNet生成临床相关的喉镜图像-标注对。

Result: 添加10%合成数据后，病变检测率提升9%（内部数据）和22.1%（外部数据）。

Conclusion: 合成数据可加速喉部疾病诊断工具开发，解决数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have
made significant progress in various medical domains, their application is
still limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,
current assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high
heterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the
gold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck
for specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated
datasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study
introduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)
coupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic
image-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses
data scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,
high-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse
anatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand
training datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in
laryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of
only 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%
when the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.
Additionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5
expert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence
in distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to
accelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,
offering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of
synthetic data in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 肺癌是全球常见的致命癌症，CT图像因其低成本和处理速度快成为首选诊断方法，但现有技术因数据不平衡导致高误诊率。

Method: 采用DenseNet201模型，结合Focal Loss、数据增强和正则化技术，解决数据不平衡和过拟合问题。

Result: 方法表现优异，准确率达到98.95%。

Conclusion: 该方法在肺癌检测和分类中具有高效性和准确性，为临床诊断提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers and is one
of the most common causes of death for men and women worldwide. Computed
Tomography (CT) images are the most preferred diagnosis method because of their
low cost and their faster processing times. Many researchers have proposed
various ways of identifying lung cancer using CT images. However, such
techniques suffer from significant false positives, leading to low accuracy.
The fundamental reason results from employing a small and imbalanced dataset.
This paper introduces an innovative approach for LC detection and
classification from CT images based on the DenseNet201 model. Our approach
comprises several advanced methods such as Focal Loss, data augmentation, and
regularization to overcome the imbalanced data issue and overfitting challenge.
The findings show the appropriateness of the proposal, attaining a promising
performance of 98.95% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专家场方法局限于单变量势函数，限制了模型表达能力，因此提出多变量扩展以提升性能。

Method: 采用Moreau包络的ℓ∞-范数构建多元势函数，扩展了专家场模型。

Result: 在去噪、去模糊、压缩感知MRI和CT等任务中，性能接近深度学习正则化器，但速度更快、参数更少、数据需求更低。

Abstract: We introduce the multivariate fields of experts, a new framework for the

methods by incorporating multivariate potential functions constructed via
Moreau envelopes of the $\ell_\infty$-norm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposal across a range of inverse problems that include image denoising,
deblurring, compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging, and computed
tomography. The proposed approach outperforms comparable univariate models and
achieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while
being significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on
substantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high
level of interpretability due to its structured design.

Conclusion: 验证了合成图像在医学诊断中的潜力，为其他癌症诊断方法扩展提供了可能。

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research
into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: FedMeNF是一种新型的联邦元学习方法，通过隐私保护损失函数解决传统FML的隐私泄露问题，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场学习需要大量数据和计算资源，传统FML存在隐私泄露问题。

Method: 提出FedMeNF，采用隐私保护损失函数在本地元优化中调节隐私泄露。

Result: 实验显示FedMeNF在少样本或非IID数据下仍能快速优化并保持隐私。

Conclusion: FedMeNF在保护隐私的同时，实现了高效和鲁棒的神经场学习。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact
with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across
four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in
object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a
baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in
average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success
rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the
potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for
complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable

TL;DR: Affordance-R1是一个统一的affordance grounding框架，通过强化学习和认知推理（CoT）提升泛化能力和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型缺乏Chain-of-Thought推理能力，限制了跨域泛化和显式推理能力。

Method: 提出Affordance-R1框架，结合GRPO强化学习和认知奖励函数，并构建ReasonAff数据集。

Result: 模型在零样本泛化和推理能力上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，展示了开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略在大型数据集训练后表现良好，但泛化能力有限，研究旨在找出原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别捷径学习的两个主要来源：子数据集多样性不足和分布差异导致的数据集碎片化。

Result: 发现数据集结构和收集策略影响泛化能力，提出数据增强方法可有效减少捷径学习。

Conclusion: 研究为数据集收集策略提供了关键见解，并证明数据增强方法在无法获取新数据时也能提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格结构提取和表示是文档理解中的关键挑战，尤其是对于监管和分析用例。

Method: 使用微调的视觉语言模型（VLM），结合增强的数据集和LoRA监督微调策略，评估采用LLM-as-a-judge和Markdown TEDS指标。

Result: 模型在标准评估中达到92.20%的准确率和96.53%的TEDS分数，优于基模型和其他大型模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定微调是连接非结构化财务文档和下游自动化的高效方法，性能优于大型通用模型。

Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from
financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding,
particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the
complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial
reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts,
multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned
vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for
high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a
curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised
fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model
on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based
LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown
Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural
fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based
assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly
surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized
reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also
significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of
widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an
effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial
documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general
models without their computational overhead.
