### [1] [Computer Vision based Automated Quantification of Agricultural Sprayers Boom Displacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19939)

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

*Yiming Ma,Victor Sanchez,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EBC-ZIP是一种基于零膨胀泊松回归的人群计数框架，通过改进损失函数处理稀疏分布问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了真实密度图的极端稀疏性，导致模型在稀疏区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出EBC-ZIP框架，使用零膨胀泊松回归的负对数似然作为损失函数，结合EBC框架的优势。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，EBC-ZIP表现优于EBC，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP通过更合理的概率损失函数，有效解决了稀疏分布问题，提升了人群计数的准确性。

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToSA是一种结合语义和空间感知的令牌合并方法，通过深度图像生成伪空间令牌，优化ViT加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有令牌合并方法主要依赖视觉令牌的特征相似性，忽略了空间信息在早期层中的重要性。

Method: 利用深度图像生成伪空间令牌，结合语义和空间信息指导令牌合并。

Result: 在多个视觉和具身问答基准上优于现有方法，同时显著减少ViT运行时间。

Conclusion: ToSA是一种高效的ViT加速解决方案，能更好地保留关键场景结构。

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrokenVideos是一个专门用于AI生成视频中视觉伪影定位的基准数据集，包含3,254个视频，带有像素级标注，显著提升了现有模型的伪影定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的视频中存在视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物理轨迹不合理等），但缺乏专门用于伪影定位的基准数据集，阻碍了质量控制和模型改进。

Method: 提出BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，带有像素级标注，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，在BrokenVideos上训练的模型显著提升了伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos为生成视频模型中的伪影定位研究提供了重要基础，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域缺乏对3D认知世界模型新兴技术的系统分类和分析，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过引入概念框架，对从2D感知到3D认知的世界模型进行结构化回顾，并分析关键技术驱动和核心认知能力。

Result: 论文总结了3D世界建模的三大核心能力（3D物理场景生成、3D空间推理和3D空间交互）及其在多个领域的应用。

Conclusion: 论文指出了数据、建模和部署中的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，以推动更鲁棒和通用的3D世界模型发展。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EAR的微调方法，用于在自回归模型中实现有效且保留效用的概念擦除，并提出了新的基准ECGVF用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉理解和图像生成任务中表现优异，但如何在保持生成质量的同时去除不需要的概念仍是一个挑战。

Method: EAR通过窗口梯度累积（WGA）策略和对阈值损失掩码（TLM）策略实现概念擦除，同时保护与目标概念无关的内容。

Result: 在ECGVF基准测试中，EAR在擦除效果和模型效用保留方面均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: EAR为自回归模型中的概念擦除提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案，并通过ECGVF基准推动了该领域的评估标准。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

### [7] [Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20152)
*Deepak Ghimire,Kilho Lee,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的损失感知自动选择结构化剪枝标准（LAASP）方法，用于压缩和加速深度神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统剪枝方法需要分阶段训练、剪枝和微调的问题，提高剪枝效率和模型性能。

Method: 采用剪枝与训练同步进行的方法，自动选择剪枝标准和层，并通过损失函数指导剪枝过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上显著减少FLOPs，同时保持或提高模型精度。

Conclusion: LAASP方法在减少计算量的同时，显著提升了模型性能，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

### [8] [Towards Efficient Exemplar Based Image Editing with Multimodal VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20155)
*Avadhoot Jadhav,Ashutosh Srivastava,Abhinav Java,Silky Singh,Tarun Ram Menta,Surgan Jandial,Balaji Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于示例对的图像编辑方法，利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态VLMs，无需优化即可高效完成编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在图像编辑中表现良好，但仅通过文本描述难以准确捕捉所有类型的编辑需求，尤其是模糊的编辑意图。

Method: 通过示例对（编辑前后的图像）表达编辑意图，利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态VLMs，构建了一个无需优化的端到端流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种编辑类型上优于基线方法，且速度提高了约4倍。

Conclusion: 基于示例对的图像编辑方法能够更高效、准确地完成复杂编辑任务，为图像编辑提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

TL;DR: 论文提出了KIE-HVQA基准和GRPO框架，用于评估和改进多模态大语言模型在视觉退化文档理解中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在视觉退化场景下容易产生幻觉内容，缺乏对不确定性的感知能力。

Method: 提出KIE-HVQA基准和GRPO框架，结合视觉不确定性的自我感知和拒绝回答机制。

Result: 实验显示，7B参数模型在KIE-HVQA上比GPT-4o提高了22%的无幻觉准确率，且标准任务性能未下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练模型在地球观测任务中的复用与组合潜力，以替代从头训练大模型的传统方法。

Method: 使用GEO-Bench基准测试，评估Prithvi、Hiera和DOFA等模型在11个数据集上的表现，采用特征级集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 小模型集成性能可匹配或超越大模型，且训练时间和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏可将集成模型的优势转移到紧凑模型中，为实际应用提供可行路径。

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

### [11] [Progressive Alignment Degradation Learning for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20179)
*Enzhe Zhao,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li,Fanghui Song,Boying Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种渐进对齐退化模块（PADM）和高频差异扩散框架（HFreqdiff），以解决传统Wald协议在深度学习全色锐化中的局限性，显著提升了图像的空间清晰度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wald协议生成的合成数据无法准确模拟真实世界的退化模式，限制了深度学习全色锐化模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过PADM模块自适应学习退化过程，并结合HFreqdiff框架嵌入高频细节，利用CFB和BACM模块进行频率选择性细节提取和反向过程学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的PADM和HFreqdiff框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为全色锐化提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCode^2提出了一种级联的视觉标记化框架，通过大规模、语义对齐的视觉标记化解决了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记化方法要么词汇量小（缺乏细粒度语义），要么简单扩展导致标记利用率低和训练不稳定。

Method: 通过聚类数百万个SigLIP序列嵌入构建500K条目的视觉标记库，采用级联设计（冻结标记库锚定嵌入空间，可训练标记库细化任务语义）确保稳定性。

Result: UniCode^2在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持高质量视觉合成且无需牺牲稳定性或语义对齐。

Conclusion: UniCode^2证明了在不牺牲稳定性、语义或模块化的情况下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合事件和图像（E-I）传输框架，通过贝叶斯建模和信息瓶颈方法消除冗余，优化带宽利用，同时实现实时去模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合系统中事件和RGB图像传输量大，存在冗余信息，需优化带宽利用并提升重建质量。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案在重建质量和去模糊性能上优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了混合系统中的传输冗余问题，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

*Ayush Lodh,Ritabrata Chakraborty,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合离线图像和在线笔画数据的端到端网络，通过早期融合在共享潜在空间中提升手写识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写识别可以从复杂的字形和笔画轨迹的互补线索中受益，但现有系统通常只利用单一模态。

Method: 设计了一个端到端网络，通过视觉标记和轻量级Transformer嵌入两种数据，并在共享潜在空间中进行早期融合。

Result: 在IAMOn-DB和VNOn-DB数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，比之前最佳结果提高了1%。

Conclusion: 早期融合方法能够增强表示学习，提高手写识别的准确性和独立性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度图像分类中存在空间信息丢失、局部特征错位、层次特征信息未充分利用以及缺乏对判别区域的关注等问题。

Method: HMDRN通过双层特征重建与融合模块平衡不同层次的特征信息，并通过空间二值掩码增强的自重建模块聚焦判别区域。

Conclusion: HMDRN通过双层重建增强类间区分度，掩码增强减少类内差异，可视化结果验证了其优越的特征重建能力。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法为艺术品分析提供了新途径，展示了深度学习在文化遗产领域的潜力。

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our
data, and checkpoints and codes are available at

Result: 实验验证了方法在配准、融合及分类性能提升上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了配准和融合效果，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

*Shunqi Mao,Wei Guo,Chaoyi Zhang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ctrl-Z Sampling的新采样策略，用于在条件生成中检测和逃离局部最优解，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中容易陷入局部最优解，导致全局不一致或条件不对齐的问题。

Method: 通过奖励模型识别局部最优解，注入噪声并回退到更早状态以逃离，动态交替进行前向优化和后向探索。

Result: 实验表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提升了生成质量，仅增加约7.6倍的函数评估次数。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种模型无关的方法，可兼容现有扩散框架，有效提升生成对齐性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

Result: 在多种膝关节诊断任务中表现优于或接近最先进的端到端深度学习模型，同时提供了临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了诊断准确性，还通过可解释性为临床提供了有价值的见解和潜在生物标志物。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

Motivation: 突发性现象在集合人脸识别中广泛存在，导致训练和评估阶段的性能下降，需要有效检测和抑制。

Result: 实验表明突发性现象普遍存在，抑制突发性显著提升了识别性能。

Conclusion: 通过检测和抑制突发性人脸，可以有效提升集合人脸识别的泛化能力和评估准确性。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的性能，发现Transformer和CNN-OBB模型在不同场景下各有优势，OBB对非笛卡尔布局至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档布局复杂，需要鲁棒的文档布局分析（DLA）方法。本文旨在比较不同模型在复杂历史文档上的表现。

Method: 使用三个数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE）评估五种模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO、YOLO三种变体），比较其性能。

Result: Co-DETR在结构化数据集（e-NDP）表现最佳，而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集（CATMuS、HORAE）中显著优于其他模型。OBB是关键改进。

Conclusion: Transformer适合结构化布局，CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档中泛化能力更强。OBB是建模历史文档非笛卡尔特性的必备条件。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态特征和不确定性建模，有效提升了动作识别的性能，适用于多种先进架构。

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和性能上取得平衡，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Method: 结合视觉语言模型生成医学图像描述，并基于PixArt-α和HLDF方法进行微调。

Result: 在两个医学图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能（FID、KID和分类性能）。

Conclusion: Med-Art有效解决了医学图像生成中的数据稀缺问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years. However, their application in medical image generation still
faces significant challenges, including small dataset sizes, and scarcity of
medical textual data. To address these challenges, we propose Med-Art, a
framework specifically designed for medical image generation with limited data.
Med-Art leverages vision-language models to generate visual descriptions of
medical images which overcomes the scarcity of applicable medical textual data.
Med-Art adapts a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model, PixArt-$\alpha$,
based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving high performance under
limited data. Furthermore, we propose an innovative Hybrid-Level Diffusion
Fine-tuning (HLDF) method, which enables pixel-level losses, effectively
addressing issues such as overly saturated colors. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance on two medical image datasets, measured by FID, KID, and downstream
classification performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Conclusion: DeepBolt在复杂地下环境中表现出色，为岩锚检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测方法忽视了在线社交网络（OSN）中压缩引入的“块效应”，且主要关注原始图像，难以应对实际场景中的挑战。

Method: PLADA包含两个核心模块：块效应消除器（B2E）和开放数据聚合（ODA），分别处理块效应和利用多种数据提升检测效果。

Result: 在26个数据集上的实验表明，PLADA在深度伪造检测中表现优异，尤其在压缩和有限配对数据的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLADA不仅解决了“块效应”问题，还为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒的深度伪造检测解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 方法简单高效，适用于实时应用，并贡献了新数据集BOAT360。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: DaS框架通过分割与摘要策略，显著提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过分区和总结有效提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿人类在模糊刺激中感知有意义模式的独特能力，即pareidolia现象。

Method: 使用开放词汇分割提取物体轮廓，利用视觉语言模型解释语义合适的动物概念，并通过文本到图像扩散模型合成符合输入形状的动物图像。

Result: 在多样化的真实世界输入上评估，展示了其鲁棒性和创意潜力。

Conclusion: Shape2Animal为视觉叙事、教育内容、数字艺术和交互媒体设计提供了新机会。

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

Result: 实验表明，逐帧训练图像能获得最准确的3D重建效果。

Conclusion: 优化相机姿态与NeRF联合训练是提升非合作空间物体3D重建精度的有效方法。

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜图像分析在诊断、合成工程和环境监测中至关重要，但深度学习模型的可解释性仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用解耦表示学习（DRL）框架，通过从合成数据中学习表示，提升模型的可解释性。

Result: 在浮游生物、酵母液泡和人类细胞三个数据集上，DRL框架在准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: DRL方法为显微镜图像分类提供了一种兼具准确性和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

TL;DR: MMSearch-R1是一个端到端的强化学习框架，使大型多模态模型能够在真实互联网环境中按需进行多轮搜索，显著减少搜索调用次数并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界信息的复杂性和动态性要求大型多模态模型能够高效访问外部知识源，而现有方法（如RAG）存在搜索行为低效或过度的问题。

Method: 提出了MMSearch-R1框架，整合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚机制指导模型决策。

Result: 实验表明，MMSearch-R1在相同模型规模下优于RAG基线，且搜索调用减少30%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态搜索研究提供了实用见解，展示了强化学习在优化搜索行为中的潜力。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPFormer introduces context-adaptive instance proposals for vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in panoptic metrics and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) rely on static queries at test time, limiting adaptability. IPFormer aims to dynamically adapt to scene context for better performance.

Method: IPFormer uses context-adaptive instance proposals derived from image context, refined through attention-based encoding and decoding to model semantic instance-voxel relationships.

Result: IPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art in PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All metrics, achieves runtime reduction over 14x, and shows significant improvements in Thing-metrics.

Conclusion: IPFormer's dynamic instance proposals are a pioneering solution for vision-based 3D PSC, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练轻量级深度网络的方法，用于预测基于图像姿态估计的抓取是否成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度物体姿态估计器过度自信的问题，避免在高不确定性下执行抓取任务导致失败。

Method: 通过真实图像中的物体姿态估计和模拟抓取生成训练数据，训练网络预测抓取成功率。

Result: 发现尽管抓取试验中物体变化大，但联合训练所有物体对网络有益。

Conclusion: 多样化的物体可以共同促进同一目标，即提高抓取成功率。

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent
that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the
uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act
under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and
uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have
connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method
for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an
image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We
generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real
images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object
variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects
jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless
contribute to the same goal.

TL;DR: HRIBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在人类感知任务中性能与延迟权衡的基准测试，涵盖五个关键领域，结果显示当前VLMs在实时部署中仍存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在人类-机器人交互（HRI）中的人类感知能力及其性能与延迟的权衡，以提升实时交互体验。

Method: 构建HRIBench基准测试，包含1000个视觉问答（VQA）问题，覆盖五个领域，并对11种VLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 当前VLMs在核心感知能力上表现不足，且性能与延迟的权衡不理想，不适合实时部署。

Conclusion: 未来需开发更小、低延迟的VLMs以提升人类感知能力，HRIBench为相关研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction
(HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable
perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively
impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.
To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and
performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual
question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse
set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key
domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction
understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social
navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected
data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue
understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four
domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of
1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.
Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still
struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of
the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory
performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring
the need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with
improved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found

Motivation: 解决基于学习的方法在训练数据有限、大变形和无标签监督时表现不佳的问题，同时避免迭代方法的速度劣势。

Method: 使用位移熵测量体素位移信号强度，引入体素自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔和预训练分割模型进行特征提取。

Result: 在腹部CT配准中，VoxelOpt在效率和精度上均优于领先的迭代方法，并与有监督学习的最优方法相当。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt通过创新方法实现了配准精度和运行时间的平衡，为无标签监督场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The

TL;DR: 提出MS-IQA，一种多尺度特征融合网络，用于PET/CT图像质量评估，结合高低层特征，提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法无法同时处理高低层特征，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 利用ResNet和Swin Transformer的多尺度特征，引入动态加权通道注意力机制融合特征。

Result: 在PET-CT-IQA-DS和LDCTIQAC2023数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-IQA为PET/CT提供了一种高效准确的图像质量评估方法。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical
role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid
in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise,
compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty
and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT
image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like
organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,
existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account
for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel
multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale
features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,
enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In
addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively
combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted
channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,
we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT
images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset
and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed
model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art
methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient
IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 该框架为骨质疏松的筛查和诊断提供了更高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and
compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations.
While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD
assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited
regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a
promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data.
Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of
unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA
discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as
spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep
learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning
method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and
preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with
learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a
multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD
regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical
sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior
generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Motivation: 肝包虫病在医疗资源有限的牧区广泛流行，现有CNN和Transformer模型在医学图像分割中存在局部感受野或计算复杂度高的问题，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: EAGLE网络采用PVSS编码器和HVSS解码器，结合CVSSB模块融合局部与全局特征，HWTB模块实现无损下采样。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过结合状态空间模型和卷积操作，实现了高效且准确的肝包虫病病灶分割，为医疗资源有限地区提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in
underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based
and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image
segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,
and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are
computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,
have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear
complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a
Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space
(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate
segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional
Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global
features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses
spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.
Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from
260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound
measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care.
However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the
operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are
demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion
framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement
information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations
from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and
characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of
radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic
features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean
absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current
machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in
diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像分辨率低且噪声多，影响生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）的准确性，现有PC-MRA方法仍有不足。

Method: 引入WMF特征，通过加权平均频率揭示脉动流经过的体素区域，并采用阈值优化和深度学习方法进行分割实验。

Result: WMF特征在深度学习中比PC-MRA特征显著提升了IoU（+0.12）和Dice（+0.13）。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为其他血管区域（如心脏或大脑）的分割提供新思路。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

TL;DR: 研究了参数化量子电路（PQCs）在量子卷积神经网络（QCNN）和混合量子卷积神经网络（HQNN）中的设计选择，应用于卫星图像分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PQCs在量子神经网络中的设计选择对性能的影响，特别是在卫星图像分类任务中。

Method: 通过评估约500种不同模型配置的数据编码技术、变分ansätze和测量方法，系统分析性能差异。

Result: 混合架构中数据编码策略对性能影响最大（验证准确率差异达30%），而变分ansätze和测量方法影响较小（差异低于5%）。纯量子模型中测量协议和数据到振幅的映射对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 数据编码策略在混合架构中起主导作用，而纯量子模型的性能更依赖于测量协议和数据映射。

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN)
architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the
EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of
data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500
distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of
influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were
benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same
architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant
factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In
contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a
comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining
below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding,
performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the
data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation
accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

TL;DR: DeepRare是一种基于大型语言模型的罕见病诊断系统，通过处理异构临床输入生成诊断假设，并在多个数据集中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低流行率和医生不熟悉而困难，DeepRare旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 系统包含中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器，整合40多种工具和最新医学知识。

Result: 在2919种疾病中达到100%准确率，显著优于其他方法，专家验证推理链一致性达95.4%。

Conclusion: DeepRare是一种高效、可追溯的罕见病诊断工具，已实现为易用的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

### [60] [X-SiT: Inherently Interpretable Surface Vision Transformers for Dementia Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20267)
*Fabian Bongratz,Tom Nuno Wolf,Jaume Gual Ramon,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的表面视觉Transformer（X-SiT），用于基于可解释的皮层特征进行医学图像分析，并在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D体积数据难以可视化和解释，而皮层表面渲染提供了更易理解的脑解剖表示，因此需要开发可解释的神经网络来支持临床决策。

Method: 提出了X-SiT，结合原型表面补丁解码器，通过基于案例的推理和空间对应的皮层原型进行分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中达到最先进性能，并提供与已知疾病模式一致的信息原型。

Conclusion: X-SiT不仅性能优越，还能提供人类可理解的预测，有助于临床决策和疾病研究。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

TL;DR: DreamAnywhere是一个模块化系统，用于快速生成和原型化3D场景，解决了现有方法在视觉保真度、场景理解和多环境适应性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D场景生成方法通常仅面向正面、缺乏视觉保真度、场景理解有限，且仅适用于室内或室外特定环境。

Method: 系统通过合成360°全景图像，分解为背景和对象，通过混合修复构建完整3D表示，并将对象掩码提升为详细3D对象。

Result: DreamAnywhere在新型视图合成中表现出更高的连贯性，图像质量具有竞争力，用户研究显示其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在低预算电影制作等场景中具有实用价值，支持快速迭代和直观编辑，技术稳健且实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant
potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although
the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the
challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments
that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene
understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor
settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a
modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system
synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into
background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid
inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in
the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and
intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual
mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These
features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,
enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead
of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it
allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current
state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,
DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view
synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its
effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user
study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,
validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

TL;DR: EditP23是一种无需掩码的3D编辑方法，通过2D图像编辑在多视角表示中实现3D一致的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖文本提示或显式空间掩码，EditP23通过原始视图和用户编辑后的图像对实现直观编辑。

Method: 利用预训练的多视角扩散模型的潜在空间中的编辑感知流，以图像对为条件，实现跨视角的连贯编辑。

Result: 在多种对象类别和编辑场景中表现出色，保持原始对象的结构和外观，无需手动掩码。

Conclusion: EditP23提供了一种高效、直观的3D编辑方法，无需优化或掩码，保持高保真度。

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D
image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In
contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or
explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a
pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image
prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a
pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently
propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without
optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both
structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of
object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source
while requiring no manual masks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过将掩码扩散模型（MDM）与自回归（AR）模型在相同的解码器架构下比较，揭示了两种范式的核心差异，并探讨了架构对MDM性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较自回归（AR）和掩码扩散模型（MDM）时，通常同时改变建模范式和架构，导致不公平的比较。本研究旨在在相同的解码器架构下评估MDM，以区分范式差异和架构影响。

Method: 在解码器架构下评估MDM（称为Any-Order AR或AO-AR），并与标准AR范式公平比较。同时研究解码器与编码器架构对MDM的影响。

Result: 研究发现，标准AO-AR目标可能需改进，因为许多排列信息较少。解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），且困惑度与编码器MDM相当。

Conclusion: 该工作解耦了范式差异与架构影响，为未来模型设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

Conclusion: MIRAGE填补了现有基准测试的空白，为多模态模型在真实世界知识密集型任务中的评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning
and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the
agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded
reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world,
knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert
interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline,
MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management
scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities,
covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user
inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich
scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge
gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or
respond. Project Page: https://mirage-benchmark.github.io

TL;DR: FedBKD提出了一种无数据蒸馏框架，通过生成对抗网络（GAN）生成合成数据，实现全局和局部模型之间的双向知识蒸馏，解决了联邦学习中非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致全局模型泛化能力差或局部模型性能不佳，且现有方法依赖公共数据集可能增加数据泄露风险。

Method: 使用GAN生成合成数据，局部模型作为判别器，参数冻结；通过合成数据实现全局与局部模型的双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FedBKD在不同non-IID设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD在不依赖公共数据集的情况下，同时提升了全局和局部模型的性能，解决了非独立同分布数据的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于学习的QR码解码，发现Transformer能够突破理论纠错限制，通过学习嵌入文本结构成功解码QR码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索中等输入敏感性的学习函数，填补QR码解码领域的学习方法空白。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行QR码解码实验，分析其学习机制。

Result: Transformer能超越理论纠错限制，泛化到不同语言和随机字符串，且解码机制与传统QR阅读器不同。

Conclusion: Transformer在中等输入敏感性任务中表现优异，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Conclusion: RSERI-EV为气候韧性电动汽车基础设施部署提供了可解释的空间分析工具。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.
