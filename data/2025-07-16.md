*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet利用小波变换和因果推理提升低光图像增强效果，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽视实例级语义信息和特征固有特性，CWNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合因果推理和小波变换，包括全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失，优化频率信息恢复。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换，实现了更精确的低光图像增强。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

### [2] [Integrating Biological Knowledge for Robust Microscopy Image Profiling on De Novo Cell Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10737)
*Jiayuan Chen,Thai-Hoang Pham,Yuanlong Wang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合外部生物知识的新框架，用于增强显微镜图像分析模型，以解决细胞系异质性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于细胞系间显著的形态和生物学异质性，传统的扰动筛选方法在新型细胞系中表现不佳。

Method: 通过知识图谱（STRING和Hetionet数据库）和单细胞转录组特征，分离扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表征。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了新型细胞系的图像分析性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在表型药物发现中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

### [3] [Auditing Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets for Posed Expressions and Racial Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10755)
*Rina Khan,Catherine Stinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了FER数据集中的自发与摆拍表情识别问题，并揭示了模型对不同肤色人群的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在识别自发表情和不同肤色人群时的性能下降和伦理问题。

Method: 审计两个先进FER数据集，提出区分自发与摆拍图像的方法，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的表现。

Result: 发现数据集中存在大量摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深肤色人群存在负面情绪预测偏见。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型的设计可能导致实际应用中的性能偏差和伦理问题，需改进数据收集和模型训练方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

*Ionuţ Grigore,Călin-Adrian Popa,Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需描述符的兴趣点匹配方法，显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要计算和匹配描述符，导致内存和计算开销大。

Method: 在检测过程中直接关联兴趣点，省去描述符步骤。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存效率上优于传统和现代学习方法。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的航天器图像分割数据集，用于训练和评估实时自主检测系统，并在YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型上取得了良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损，人工或机器人维修成本高且风险大，需要可靠且经济的自主检测系统。

Method: 创建了包含64k标注图像的航天器数据集，结合真实和合成背景，并添加噪声和失真。使用YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行微调和性能评估。

Result: 模型在模拟实时约束下，Dice分数为0.92，Hausdorff距离为0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效解决方案，性能优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal
Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM
finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we
present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong
and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the
challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse
scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to
conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given
complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City

our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object

### [7] [ThinkingViT: Matryoshka Thinking Vision Transformer for Elastic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10800)
*Ali Hojjat,Janek Haberer,Soren Pirk,Olaf Landsiedel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种嵌套ViT架构，通过动态调整计算资源提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌套Transformer对所有输入分配相同计算资源，导致效率低下。

Method: 采用渐进式思考阶段和Token Recycling机制，动态调整注意力头。

Result: 在相同计算量下，ThinkingViT比基线模型准确率提升2.0-2.9个百分点。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT显著提升了计算效率和准确性，可作为ViT的插件升级。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

### [8] [LLM-Guided Agentic Object Detection for Open-World Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10844)
*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），实现无需标签的零样本检测，并通过新指标CAAP和SNAP评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，灵活性不足；现有方法如OWOD和OVOD各有局限，需更自主的解决方案。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景相关对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器实现动态目标检测。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能检测并命名新对象。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

### [9] [Winsor-CAM: Human-Tunable Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Layer-Wise Winsorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10846)
*Casey Wall,Longwei Wang,Rodrigue Rizk,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM是一种改进的Grad-CAM方法，通过跨层聚合信息和Winsorization技术生成更鲁棒和可解释的显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释CNN决策过程在高风险领域至关重要，但现有方法（如Grad-CAM）可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，通过Winsorization技术抑制极端值，并允许用户通过阈值调整语义层次。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM在定位指标（如IoU和中心对齐）上优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层级解释和人机交互控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

*Wei Chen,Jingxi Yu,Zichen Miao,Qiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏编码的微调框架，通过稀疏组合特征字典原子来提升模型的可解释性和任务适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调方法难以解释参数更新的贡献，稀疏编码框架旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用稀疏编码表示微调特征，通过稀疏系数指示原子重要性，提升任务适应性。

Result: 在图像编辑和文本到图像概念定制任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架有效提升了模型的可解释性和任务性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Lennart Svensson,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trexplorer Super是一种改进的3D医学图像中心线跟踪模型，解决了重复分支和提前终止的问题，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确跟踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）对医学任务至关重要，但现有模型存在缺陷且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super模型，开发了三个难度递增的数据集（一个合成和两个真实）进行全面评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super在所有数据集上均优于现有SOTA模型，且合成数据表现不总能反映真实数据表现。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线跟踪性能，同时公开了代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/RomStriker/Trexplorer-Super.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的AI天气预报模型虽然精度高，但训练复杂且资源需求大，因此需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用现代化CNN架构，结合尺度不变设计和InceptionNext块，针对地球系统数据优化，训练参数仅700万。

Result: KAI-a在中等范围天气预报中性能与最先进模型相当，且训练时间短（12小时），能有效捕捉极端天气事件。

Conclusion: KAI-a展示了CNN在天气预报中的潜力，为高效、轻量化的AI天气预报模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的正则化策略（LVL和LGCL）来解决EEG情感识别中的时间尺度依赖标签不一致问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度依赖标签不一致（TsDLI）问题，提升模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出了局部变化损失（LVL）和局部-全局一致性损失（LGCL），结合有界变差函数和交换时间距离的数学原理。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上，LVL和LGCL在多种神经网络架构中均优于现有方法，LVL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在标签不一致情况下实现了预测性能和可解释性的平衡，LVL和LGCL表现突出。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

*Zhengyi Xu,Haoran Wu,Wen Jiang,Jie Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAPL-SCD的图聚合原型学习方法，用于解决遥感数据中语义变化检测的多任务优化问题，通过自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易导致负迁移问题，因此需要一种方法来缓解任务间的冲突并提升多任务学习能力。

Method: 提出了GAPL-SCD框架，结合图聚合原型学习、自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法，优化语义分割和变化检测任务，并通过多级特征交互和双时相特征融合增强特征表示。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD通过多任务联合优化和特征增强，显著提升了语义变化检测的性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

Result: 实验表明RIDFR优于现有方法，重建高质量ID特定结果，身份保真度高且鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: RIDFR有效解决了身份不确定性问题，提升了人脸修复的身份保真度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 当前步态识别方法大多未解决遮挡问题，且现有方法在遮挡和完整步态之间难以兼顾性能。

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保留完整步态识别能力的有效技术。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

TL;DR: SpaRTAN是一种轻量级架构设计，通过多阶空间特征和通道聚合模块提升性能，参数高效且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代CNN和Transformer存在简单性偏好和信息冗余问题，SpaRTAN旨在解决这些限制。

Method: SpaRTAN采用可变感受野的核和波式通道聚合模块，增强空间和通道信息处理。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和COCO基准测试中，SpaRTAN以较少参数实现高性能。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计在视觉任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 零样本异常检测在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法在测试效率和准确性上存在不足。

Method: 结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，并通过文本信息过滤噪声特征。

Result: 在MVTec-AD上，FiSeCLIP在分割指标AU-ROC和F1-max上分别提升4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强基线，展示了CLIP模型在细粒度任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，减少数据偏差影响，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Schrodinger Bridge的CBCT-to-MDCT转换框架，结合GAN先验和人类引导的条件扩散，显著提升了医学图像翻译的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN或扩散模型在医学图像翻译中难以同时保证解剖学保真度和感知可控性，且缺乏人类反馈的整合。

Method: 通过Schrodinger Bridge框架整合GAN先验和人类引导的条件扩散，利用分类器自由引导（CFG）和迭代优化，实现边界一致性和临床偏好对齐。

Result: 在临床数据集上，该方法在RMSE、SSIM、LPIPS和Dice指标上表现优异，仅需10步采样即可超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在实时医学图像翻译中表现出高效性和临床偏好对齐能力，为医学影像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

<details>

Motivation: 解决开放词汇语义分割无法理解个性化文本（如‘我的杯子’）的问题，识别用户特定兴趣区域。

Method: 采用文本提示调优和负掩码提案，减少错误预测，并通过视觉嵌入增强文本提示表示。

Result: 在新建立的基准测试（FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$、ADE$^\text{per}$）上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法在不影响原始开放词汇语义分割性能的情况下，显著提升了个性化分割能力。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域框架和物理引导的退化对齐，显著提升了去雾效果和计算效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Conclusion: FootGait3D在生物力学、临床步态分析和机器人应用中具有重要潜力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

Motivation: 现有医学语言引导的分割方法依赖成对的图像-文本输入，导致许多无文本的医学图像数据无法充分利用，且限制了在临床场景中的应用。

Method: 提出ProLearn框架，引入原型驱动的语义近似（PSA）模块，通过原型空间近似文本语义指导，减少对文本输入的依赖。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19、MosMedData+和Kvasir-SEG数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn通过原型驱动的学习，有效解决了文本依赖问题，扩展了语言引导分割的适用性。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关节角度建模的新方法，用于改进无标记人体姿态估计（HPE）中的关键点识别和轨迹平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HPE在分析运动学人体姿态时存在关键点识别错误和轨迹随机波动的问题，且现有深度学习模型的性能受限于手动标注的不准确训练数据集。

Method: 通过关节角度建模，包括构建关节角度模型、用高阶傅里叶级数近似关节角度的时间变化以获取可靠“真实值”，并设计双向循环网络作为后处理模块。

Result: 使用该方法构建的高质量数据集训练的模型在纠正错误识别关节和平滑时空轨迹方面表现出色，在花样滑冰和霹雳舞等挑战性案例中优于现有HPE细化网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的细化方法（JAR）在改进HPE性能方面具有显著优势，尤其在复杂运动场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Result: 实验表明GKNet在精度和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GKNet在非合作航天器姿态估计中表现出色，SKD数据集为关键点检测提供了验证平台。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

Result: 召回率超过98.6%，减少约90%的人工检测工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法在在线系统中表现优异，显著提升了病害识别的自动化水平。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Conclusion: KptLLM++ 在细粒度图像理解和人机交互方面具有变革性意义。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three

Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish
species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the
Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other
feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy
of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges
and advancing species detection in marine environments.

Motivation: 困难样本在CC-ReID任务中因模糊性或相似性成为瓶颈，限制了针对性学习策略的设计和模型鲁棒性。

Method: HSGL包含双粒度困难样本生成（DGHSG）和困难样本自适应学习（HSAL），前者通过多模态线索生成语义一致的样本，后者通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Conclusion: 多模态引导的困难样本生成与学习是提升CC-ReID任务鲁棒性和性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决模态冲突，实现紧凑高效的多模态场景表示。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,
Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our
proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural

evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于公平性的分组方法，用于处理连续敏感属性，通过最大化组间歧视差异的新标准来识别关键子群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理连续敏感属性（如肤色）时可能忽略少数群体的歧视问题，需要更精细的分组方法。

Method: 提出一种基于歧视水平的分组方法，最大化组间歧视差异，并通过合成数据集和真实数据集验证其鲁棒性。

Result: 在CelebA和FFHQ数据集上，新方法揭示了更细微的歧视模式，并在去偏任务中提高了公平性且对准确性影响最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续敏感属性的公平性评估提供了有效工具，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Result: 在3D视觉定位数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确空间区分的复杂查询中。

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解有效解决了3D视觉定位中的复杂查询和视角变化问题。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of
interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits,
axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616

annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a
cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to
the experts. Cohen's Kappa and inter-rater agreement heatmap confirm the
reliability of automated fine-grained phenotyping using our approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial

adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk
management and territorial planning.

Result: 实验证明框架有效，实现了精确的表面重建。

Conclusion: 多基元组合的高斯泼溅方法显著提升了表面重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet有效结合单目和多视角优势，显著提升MVS性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Conclusion: UGC-VideoCap为真实场景下的多模态视频字幕生成提供了高质量基准和数据高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Result: 在医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩比显著提升，训练速度加快4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为高效大图像压缩提供了新解决方案，平衡了速度、压缩比和图像质量。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 解决计算机难以模仿人类颜色感知的问题，缩小计算颜色表示与人类视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法，包括初步实验、大规模人类分类调查（1000+受试者），提取模糊分区和生成隶属函数。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计、AI、营销和人机交互等领域具有重要意义，因其感知相关的颜色表示能力。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Conclusion: 该方法在语义对齐和图像质量上优于现有技术。

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic
alignment and image quality.

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致性生成方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，支持大规模和通用化研究。

Conclusion: NavComposer和NavInstrCritic解决了导航指令生成和评估的瓶颈，推动了更可扩展的研究。

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 医疗联邦学习中的数据隐私保护需求与标签噪声问题（如数据异质性和不平衡）导致模型性能下降，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 提出FedGSCA框架，包括全局样本选择器（聚合噪声知识）和客户端自适应调整机制（结合伪标签生成和鲁棒损失函数）。

Result: 在真实和合成医疗数据集上测试，FedGSCA在极端和异质噪声场景中优于现有方法，提升了模型稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedGSCA有效解决了医疗联邦学习中的噪声问题，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two

Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and

thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a

Conclusion: FOEM在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异，可无缝集成先进技术，进一步缩小与全精度基线的差距。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

TL;DR: Elevate3D是一个新颖的框架，通过HFS-SDEdit方法提升低质量3D资产的质量，同时结合几何优化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量3D资产稀缺且获取成本高，Elevate3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用HFS-SDEdit进行纹理增强，并结合单目几何预测器优化几何细节。

Result: Elevate3D在3D模型细化方面达到最先进的质量。

Conclusion: Elevate3D有效缓解了高质量开源3D资产的稀缺问题。

Abstract: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer
graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.
To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that
transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the
core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that
significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and
geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a
view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.
Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our
framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by
employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures
detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced
texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art
quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of
high-quality open-source 3D assets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时交互感知框架rt-RISeg，通过机器人交互和设计的体帧不变特征（BFIF）来分割未见物体，无需预训练模型，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖大规模数据集训练，容易过拟合静态视觉特征，泛化能力差。论文基于视觉本质是交互的假设，提出新方法。

Method: 提出rt-RISeg框架，通过机器人交互分析体帧不变特征（BFIF），利用相对旋转和线性速度识别物体，实时生成和更新分割掩码。

Result: 实验表明，rt-RISeg的平均分割准确率比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，且生成的分割掩码可作为视觉基础模型的提示，进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg是一种无需预训练模型的独立框架，通过交互感知实现高效未见物体分割，并兼容视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

### [77] [Whom to Respond To? A Transformer-Based Model for Multi-Party Social Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10960)
*He Zhu,Ryo Miyoshi,Yuki Okafuji*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于改进社交机器人在多用户环境中的决策过程，通过两种新的损失函数和新的数据集，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户环境中，社交机器人需要理解上下文并决定何时及向谁响应，而现有研究主要关注单用户交互。

Method: 采用Transformer多任务学习框架，引入两种新损失函数：一种约束主动说话者以改进场景建模，另一种引导响应选择针对机器人的话语。构建了新的多用户HRI数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在响应决策上优于现有启发式和单任务方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了社交机器人在自然和上下文感知的多用户交互中的发展。

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LE-Nav是一个基于多模态大语言模型和条件变分自编码器的导航框架，能够自适应调整规划器超参数，在多样化和动态环境中实现人类水平的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖固定参数，难以适应动态和多样化环境，导致性能下降和社会接受度降低。现有强化学习方法因泛化能力差和模拟多样性不足，难以在实际部署中有效工作。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型推理和条件变分自编码器，通过一次性示例和思维链提示策略实现零样本场景理解，并捕捉自然语言指令与导航超参数之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验表明，LE-Nav生成的超参数在多样规划器和场景中达到人类水平调整。实际导航试验和用户研究显示其在成功率、效率、安全性和舒适度等定量指标上优于现有方法，主观评分也更高。

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过自适应超参数调整，显著提升了导航系统在动态和多样化环境中的性能和社会接受度，为服务机器人导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TRAN-D是一种基于2D高斯泼溅的透明物体深度重建方法，通过分离透明物体与背景并优化高斯分布，显著提升了稀疏视图和动态环境下的3D几何重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的3D几何重建因反射和折射等物理特性而具有挑战性，尤其是在稀疏视图和动态环境中。

Method: TRAN-D通过分离透明物体与背景，使用对象感知损失和物理模拟优化高斯分布，减少伪影并覆盖不可见表面。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中，TRAN-D比现有方法表现更优，合成数据上的平均绝对误差降低39%，单图像更新时精度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体深度重建中表现出色，为稀疏视图和动态环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法，利用事件相机和神经网络替代传统惯性传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多飞行生物依赖视觉而非重力感知，而飞行机器人通常依赖惯性传感器。本研究旨在探索仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法。

Method: 使用下视事件相机和循环卷积神经网络，通过监督学习训练，估计姿态和旋转速率。

Result: 实验证明该方法可替代传统惯性测量单元，且网络在不同环境和视野下表现良好。

Conclusion: 视觉飞行控制是实现小型自主飞行机器人的有前景方案。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

*Duoyou Chen,Yunqing Chen,Can Zhang,Zhou Wang,Cheng Chen,Ruoxiu Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的扩散模型CLS-DM，用于从稀疏X射线图像重建3D CT，解决了2D与3D潜在空间对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT重建方法存在时间消耗大和辐射高的问题，稀疏X射线图像重建可降低成本与风险，但现有扩散模型在跨模态潜在空间对齐上表现不佳。

Method: CLS-DM通过跨模态特征对比学习，从2D X射线图像中提取3D潜在信息，实现模态间潜在空间对齐。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和CTSpine1K数据集上，CLS-DM在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于经典和最新生成模型。

Conclusion: CLS-DM提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果和经济性，并可推广至其他跨模态转换任务。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

*J. Senthilnath,Chen Hao,F. C. Wellstood*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为3D MIR的新方法，结合深度学习和物理约束，用于半导体封装中的3D电流参数恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半导体封装中，准确恢复3D信息对于无损检测（NDT）定位电路缺陷至关重要。

Method: 3D MIR通过三个阶段实现：1) CNN处理MFI数据预测参数；2) 利用空间物理约束提供初始估计；3) 优化器调整参数以最小化误差。

Result: 3D MIR方法能够高精度恢复3D信息，为磁图像重建设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Conclusion: HANS-Net提供解剖一致、准确且可靠的分割，适用于临床诊断和治疗规划。

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the
3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of
1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different
datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in
providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor
segmentation.

Motivation: 肺炎（如COVID-19引起的）是全球健康挑战，需要快速准确的诊断方法。

Method: 评估了多种方法，包括传统机器学习（PCA聚类、逻辑回归、支持向量分类）和深度学习（CNN、ViT）。

Result: Cross-ViT表现最佳，准确率88.25%，召回率99.42%，且模型架构比大小更重要。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers在肺炎检测中表现出色，有望在健康危机中提供更快速准确的诊断。

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a
critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This
study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and
state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection
using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from
conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning
architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet,
DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT,
Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856
pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the
Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and
99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that
architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size,
with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also
addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training
requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical
diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising
direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid

TL;DR: GLCM-MAE提出了一种基于灰度共生矩阵（GLCM）的MAE预训练框架，用于医学图像的自监督表示学习，显著提升了下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAE在自然图像中通过像素级MSE损失重建模糊图像效果良好，但在医学图像中纹理信息对分类至关重要，MSE无法保留关键形态特征。

Method: 提出GLCM-MAE框架，利用GLCM捕捉图像的强度和空间关系，设计可微分的GLCM匹配损失函数以保留形态特征。

Result: 在胆囊癌、乳腺癌、肺炎和COVID检测任务中，GLCM-MAE分别提升2.1%、3.1%、0.5%和0.6%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCM-MAE通过GLCM损失有效保留了医学图像的纹理信息，显著提升了自监督预训练在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for
self-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are
pre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error
(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe
that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural
images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the
texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the
strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training
framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM
captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss
helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation
to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We
demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed
GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection
from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by
3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by
0.6%. Source code and pre-trained models are available at:

Conclusion: U-RWKV为资源受限环境提供了一种高效且高性能的医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究白质纤维束的局部差异，尤其是在健康和疾病群体之间，需要更敏感和特异的方法。

Method: 结合图谱引导的纤维束分割和非参数置换检验，实现精细尺度的统计分析。

Result: 在合成和真实数据中，AGFS-Tractometry表现出更高的敏感性和特异性，能检测到更多显著差异区域。

Conclusion: AGFS-Tractometry是一种有效的工具，可用于检测白质纤维束的局部差异。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

Method: 构建MISS-QA基准，包含465篇科学论文中的1,500个标注示例，测试模型在示意图解释和信息检索任务中的表现。

Result: 18个前沿模型（如o4-mini、Gemini-2.5-Flash等）与人类专家相比存在显著性能差距，尤其在不可回答问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MISS-QA揭示了当前模型在多模态科学文献理解中的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了关键方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within
scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over
465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting
schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering
corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the
paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,
including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant
performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis
of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis
further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key
insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语生成因复杂性和独特规则而受限，现有大语言模型对其影响有限。

Method: 通过微调LLM并采用逐步提示策略，学习文本与手语的对应关系。

Result: 在How2Sign和Phoenix14T数据集上，TEAM-Sign有效利用LLM的手语知识和推理能力。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign成功对齐手语和口语的差异，为手语生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

TL;DR: 使用Spiker+框架生成优化的SNN加速器，用于MNIST手写数字识别，适合边缘计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速器对边缘应用的低延迟、高效推理至关重要，SNN因其事件驱动和稀疏特性适合低功耗FPGA部署。

Method: 利用Spiker+框架，支持高级网络拓扑、神经元模型和量化规范，自动生成可部署的HDL。

Result: 评估多种配置，分析边缘计算约束下的权衡。

Conclusion: Spiker+能有效生成优化的SNN加速器，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Hardware accelerators are essential for achieving low-latency,
energy-efficient inference in edge applications like image recognition. Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly promising due to their event-driven and
temporally sparse nature, making them well-suited for low-power Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based deployment. This paper explores using the
open-source Spiker+ framework to generate optimized SNNs accelerators for
handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Spiker+ enables high-level
specification of network topologies, neuron models, and quantization,
automatically generating deployable HDL. We evaluate multiple configurations
and analyze trade-offs relevant to edge computing constraints.
