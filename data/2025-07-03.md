### [1] [Geometry-aware 4D Video Generation for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01099)
*Zeyi Liu,Shuang Li,Eric Cousineau,Siyuan Feng,Benjamin Burchfiel,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练，实现多视角3D一致性，提升机器人操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和预测物理世界动态有助于机器人在复杂环境中规划和交互，但目前视频生成模型在多视角几何一致性方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练，学习共享3D场景表示，仅需RGB-D观测即可预测未来视频序列。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上，模型生成的多视角预测更稳定且空间对齐，并能用于恢复机器人末端执行器轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法支持鲁棒的机器人操作，并能泛化到新视角，为机器人交互提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Landslides pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and human lives,
necessitating accurate detection and predictive mapping across diverse
geographic regions. With advancements in deep learning and remote sensing,
automated landslide detection has become increasingly effective. This study
presents a comprehensive approach integrating multi-source satellite imagery
and deep learning models to enhance landslide identification and prediction. We
leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features
influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are
employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover,
and rainfall on detection accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net,
DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide
detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable
early warning systems, improved disaster risk management, and sustainable
land-use planning. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential of
deep learning and multi-source remote sensing in creating robust, scalable, and
transferable landslide prediction models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cp_measure是一个Python库，将CellProfiler的核心测量功能模块化，便于程序化特征提取，支持机器学习工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物图像分析工具（如CellProfiler）在自动化和可重复性方面存在障碍，阻碍了机器学习工作流。

Method: 开发cp_measure库，提取CellProfiler的核心测量功能，提供模块化、API优先的工具。

Result: cp_measure特征与CellProfiler特征高度一致，并能无缝集成到Python生态中。

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

*Zhuo Su,Li Liu,Matthias Müller,Jiehua Zhang,Diana Wofk,Ming-Ming Cheng,Matti Pietikäinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效网络设计，结合传统显著目标检测（SOD）方法和现代CNN的表征能力，通过像素差异卷积（PDCs）和差异卷积重参数化（DCR）策略，显著提升了资源受限设备上的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOD模型计算成本高，难以在资源受限设备上实现实时性能，因此需要一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 提出SDNet（图像SOD）和STDNet（视频SOD），利用PDCs编码特征对比，并通过DCR策略嵌入标准卷积以减少计算量。STDC进一步增强了视频SOD的时空对比捕捉能力。

Result: 模型在Jetson Orin设备上以46 FPS（图像）和150 FPS（视频）运行，参数少于1M，速度和准确性均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备的实时SOD任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

### [5] [Robust Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete MRI Modalities Using Hölder Divergence and Mutual Information-Enhanced Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01254)
*Runze Cheng,Xihang Qiu,Ming Li,Ye Zhang,Chun Li,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单模态并行处理的鲁棒框架，用于处理多模态MRI中缺失模态的脑肿瘤分割问题，通过Holder散度和互信息保持模态特征并动态调整网络参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI在脑肿瘤分割中提供互补信息，但传统方法在模态缺失时表现不佳，需要一种鲁棒的方法来处理这一问题。

Method: 采用Holder散度和互信息作为损失函数，动态调整网络参数，保持模态特征并量化预测与真实标签的差异。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和BraTS 2020数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在模态缺失情况下。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态MRI缺失情况下仍能实现高精度的脑肿瘤分割，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

*Xiao Liu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIGVE-MACS是一个统一的AI生成视频评估模型，提供数值评分和多方面语言评论反馈，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标缺乏解释性，与人类评估对齐度低，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 利用AIGVE-BENCH 2基准数据集，结合视觉语言模型、新颖的加权损失和动态帧采样策略。

Result: 在评分相关性和评论质量上达到最优性能，视频生成质量提升53.5%。

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频的全面、人类对齐评估建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2
and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.

### [7] [Advancements in Weed Mapping: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01269)
*Mohammad Jahanbakht,Alex Olsen,Ross Marchant,Emilie Fillols,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了杂草测绘领域的最新进展，填补了从数据采集到处理技术和测绘工具的全面文献空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂草测绘在精准管理中至关重要，但缺乏全面的文献综述，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 通过PRISMA指南系统评估数据采集（传感器和平台技术）、数据处理（标注和建模）和测绘技术（时空分析和决策支持工具）的最新方法。

Result: 综述提供了杂草测绘领域的全面理解，为未来研究提供了基础参考。

Conclusion: 本文为高效、可扩展和可持续的杂草管理系统的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

### [8] [Frequency Domain-Based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01275)
*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域的扩散模型（\ours），用于无配对图像去雾，通过振幅残差编码器和相位校正模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法引入了与雾无关的内容信息，且忽略了频域中的雾相关特性。

Method: 利用扩散模型在频域中重建振幅谱，提出振幅残差编码器（ARE）和相位校正模块（PCM）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: \ours通过频域重建和扩散模型有效解决了无配对图像去雾问题。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Sunyong Seo,Semin Kim,Jongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ET-Fuser是一种新颖的方法，通过利用基于预训练模型任务先验的注意力机制，学习集成令牌，以统一特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单任务学习中缺乏统一的特征表示，ET-Fuser旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于自注意力机制的集成令牌学习方法，利用预训练编码器的互信息。

Result: 在多种面部分析任务中表现出显著的特征表示改进，且计算成本极低。

Conclusion: ET-Fuser通过集成令牌实现了高效且统一的特征表示，适用于面部分析任务。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为铬球修复问题来从单张低动态范围（LDR）图像估计光照的简单有效技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限的HDR全景数据集，泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL进行铬球修复，并通过迭代修复计算中值铬球作为稳定的低频光照先验。

Result: 提出了DiffusionLight和DiffusionLight-Turbo，后者将运行时间从30分钟缩短至30秒，且质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化场景中生成可信的光照估计，并展示了在真实场景中的优越泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at
https://diffusionlight.github.io/turbo

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at
https://github.com/cuongle1206/Phys-GRD

*Luxi Zhao,Mahmoud Afifi,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过学习后照明估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好的校正，实现跨相机美学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非准确的中性校正，且现有学习方法的泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过学习后照明估计映射，将中性校正转换为美学偏好的校正，适用于任何中性AWB模块。

Result: 模型仅含约500参数，运行速度快（0.024毫秒），在771张智能手机图像上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算和内存开销极低的同时，实现了跨相机美学一致性和高性能。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTTA是一种通用的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种视觉和非视觉任务，通过扰动PCA子空间投影形成鲁棒集成，并通过自监督学习降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间增强方法缺乏通用性，GTTA旨在提供一种适用于多种任务的通用解决方案。

Method: GTTA通过随机扰动PCA子空间投影形成集成，并引入自监督学习阶段，用集成输出训练初始模型。

Result: GTTA在多种任务和数据集上验证了其通用性和有效性，包括图像分类、分割、语音识别和房价预测。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种高效且通用的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种任务，并在特定任务（如鲑鱼检测）中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种长尾分布感知路由器（LTDR），用于视觉语言混合专家模型（MoE），解决了模态间分布差异和视觉尾部令牌激活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE框架忽视了视觉与语言之间的分布差异，导致路由策略不匹配。

Method: 提出LTDR，针对语言和视觉的不同分布设计路由策略，并对视觉尾部令牌采用过采样策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR显著提升了视觉语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的少样本奖励建模方法Activation RMs，通过激活引导构建对齐的奖励信号，无需额外微调，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好，需要大量数据和单独模型。

Method: 利用激活引导构建奖励信号，仅需少量监督。

Result: 在标准基准和PreferenceHack基准上表现优异，超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Activation RMs为安全关键应用提供了高效且灵活的奖励建模方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的应用缺乏准确性和统计保证，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 采用AI模型预测测量值，通过重要性采样选择样本进行人工标注，迭代优化模型和估计。

Result: Active measurement在多个测量任务中降低了估计误差，且对AI模型的准确性要求较低。

Conclusion: 该框架为科学测量提供了一种高效且可靠的方法，尤其适用于需要高精度的场景。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪标签增强的音频-视觉Mamba网络（MUG），用于提升弱监督音频-视觉视频解析任务中的段级和事件级预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构的限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并采用音频-视觉Mamba网络进行特征处理和交互。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和Mamba网络设计，显著提升了弱监督音频-视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明FixTalk有效解决上述问题，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FixTalk通过创新设计显著提升说话头部生成质量。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在病例级诊断中表现出色，为产前超声分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaptionSmiths提出了一种新方法，通过量化描述长度、描述性和词汇独特性等属性，实现图像描述模型对语言模式的灵活控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以精细控制生成描述的属性，且无法平滑过渡语言模式。

Method: 通过量化描述属性并利用端点向量插值进行条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整描述属性，词汇对齐优于基线，长度控制误差降低506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths为图像描述模型提供了灵活的语言模式控制能力。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on
https://github.com/omron-sinicx/captionsmiths.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度方向的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度来提升检测效果，同时保持ID分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，OOD检测对模型安全部署至关重要。研究发现，ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本的梯度方向混乱，这启发了通过短路异常梯度来改进OOD检测。

Method: 提出了一种推理阶段的技术，短路异常梯度，并通过局部一阶近似避免重复计算。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现优异，方法轻量且对推理流程改动小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验验证了该方法的优越性，且开发的大规模合成数据集SDCSRD为模型训练提供了支持。

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion在文档图像阴影去除任务中表现优于现有方法，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: DiffMark通过扩散模型和新型引导机制，显著提升了水印对抗Deepfake篡改的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Motivation: 现有基于最大团搜索的PCR方法虽然召回率高，但时间复杂度指数级增长，不适用于实时应用。

Result: TurboReg在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，速度显著提升（如3DMatch+FCGF数据集上比3DMAC快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg通过高效算法设计，在保持高召回率的同时大幅提升速度，适用于实时PCR任务。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Result: 在两个基准数据集上验证了框架的优越性和兼容性。

Conclusion: OoDDINO有效提升异常分割性能，可作为插件增强其他模型。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NOCTIS通过结合先进模型和创新的匹配策略，实现了对未见物体的高效实例分割。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在去噪推理过程中未充分利用判别性表征的潜力。

Method: 提出REG方法，将图像潜在变量与预训练模型的类别标记纠缠，实现图像和类别的联合生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，REG显著加速训练（63倍和23倍），且训练400K次即优于REPA训练4M次。

Conclusion: REG通过语义引导生成，高效且开销低，为扩散模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种加速甲烷泄漏检测的方法，通过高效低功耗算法（如Mag1c-SAS和CEM）和机器学习模型（U-Net、LinkNet）结合，显著提升了计算速度，同时保持了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Conclusion: AVC-DPO 成功实现了视频标题生成的人类偏好对齐，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the
VDCSCORE evaluation metric.

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

Conclusion: 提出的规则后处理方法有效提升了树冠检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 息肉分割在结肠镜图像中对早期结直肠癌检测至关重要，但现有方法在弱边界和模糊边界情况下表现不佳，且泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出SAM-MaGuP，结合边界蒸馏模块和1D-2D Mamba适配器，增强特征学习和全局上下文交互。

Result: 在五个数据集上的评估显示，SAM-MaGuP优于现有方法，实现了更高的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新的Mamba引导边界先验和1D-2D Mamba块，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub
repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

Conclusion: TrackingMiM通过改进Mamba的时间连续性处理，显著提升了无人机跟踪任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,

problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%

by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长捕捉低频特征但忽视高频边界细节，而扩散生成模型擅长生成高频细节但低频语义推理不足。

Method: 结合判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上验证了IDGBR能一致提升不同判别式架构的边界精度。

Conclusion: IDGBR框架有效结合了两种学习的优势，显著提升了语义分割的边界质量。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/KeyanHu-git/IDGBR.

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive

this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively

Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely

Abstract: This study presents a novel classroom surveillance system that integrates
multiple modalities, including drowsiness, tracking of mobile phone usage, and
face recognition,to assess student attentiveness with enhanced precision.The
system leverages the YOLOv8 model to detect both mobile phone and sleep
usage,(Ghatge et al., 2024) while facial recognition is achieved through

remain seated in the classroom, offering scalability for diverse educational

*Yue-Jiang Dong,Wang Zhao,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Song-Hai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthSync提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过扩散引导实现长视频的尺度和几何一致性深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度不一致和几何预测不一致的问题，主要依赖2D扩散先验而忽略了3D几何结构。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，协同调整去噪过程，确保跨窗口尺度同步和窗口内几何对齐。

Result: 实验表明DepthSync在多个数据集上显著提升了深度预测的尺度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DepthSync为长视频深度预测提供了一种高效且一致的方法，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Motivation: 深度学习人脸识别系统在现实场景中的后门攻击研究尚属空白，本文旨在填补这一盲点。

Method: 通过探索后门攻击在整个人脸识别流程中的可行性，展示了两种新型攻击方式，并测试了20种流程配置和15种攻击案例。

Result: 研究表明，单一后门攻击可绕过整个系统功能，同时提出了防御措施。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了人脸识别系统的后门漏洞，并为相关方提供了防护建议。

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

TL;DR: POLC提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法，通过丰富潜在特征的语义内容，提升压缩域语义推理性能，同时减少微调参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MSE优化的潜在空间语义有限，且微调计算成本高，POLC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用感知导向的潜在编码（POLC），仅需插拔式适配器进行微调。

Result: POLC在保持与生成图像编码方法相当的率感知性能的同时，显著提升视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: POLC是一种高效且性能优越的压缩域语义推理方法。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is
available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/POLC.

TL;DR: P3HOT框架通过结合提示引导和人类近端感知，提升了人-物接触检测的准确性，解决了现有模型在区域一致性和分割过度上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-物接触检测模型在单一图像类型上表现受限，容易过度分割且难以保持区域类别一致性。

Method: P3HOT结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，动态感知关键深度范围，并使用区域联合损失（RJLoss）抑制异常类别。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，模型在四个指标上均取得显著提升，最高提升达11.0%。

Conclusion: P3HOT通过多机制融合和新的评估指标，实现了人-物接触检测的先进性能。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种用于大规模场景3D重建的框架，通过分块处理和优化策略，解决了传统NeRF方法的内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，而大规模场景的3D重建需求日益增长。

Method: 采用分块处理策略，将场景划分为无重叠的3D块，并通过图像裁剪和重叠采样确保数据完整性。引入2×2 3D块渐进策略和分段采样器，避免边缘重建错误。

Result: 实验表明，Snake-NeRF能在单GPU上线性时间内高效处理大规模卫星图像，且不损失重建质量。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF为大规模场景的3D重建提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在一般场景表现良好，但在复杂开放世界环境中（如光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真）表现不佳。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习块级相对关系。

Result: 实验证明DepthAnything-AC在多样基准测试中具有零样本能力，包括真实恶劣天气、合成失真和一般场景。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过新方法解决了复杂环境下的深度估计问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有ViT通过图像-文本对比学习或自监督机制表现优异，但与LLM直接联合训练时存在参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距问题。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过逐步特征细化实现粗到细的特征对齐和世界知识注入，满足目标训练需求。

Result: SAILViT在不同参数规模、架构、训练策略和数据规模下表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升MLLM在OpenCompass基准上的性能。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的挑战，为复杂多模态交互提供了性能突破。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，存在计算复杂度和内存开销大的问题，而线性注意力机制在图像生成中表现不佳。

Method: 提出LASAD机制，通过2D空间位置依赖的衰减因子保留空间关系，并基于此构建LASADGen模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上，LASADGen实现了最先进的图像生成性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的效率与高质量生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Result: 实验表明RobuSTereo显著提升了模型在多种恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo有效解决了数据稀缺和特征提取问题，提升了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

Motivation: 传统标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景中的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续放置标记并结合Oracle引导的搜索优化位置。

Result: SPoT显著减少了推理所需的标记数量，同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效且可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为战略优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Motivation: 探索是否可以通过端到端强化学习训练智能体完成图像目标导航任务，从而避免依赖专用图像匹配或预训练模块。

Method: 通过大规模研究分析不同架构选择（如延迟融合、通道堆叠、空间到深度投影和交叉注意力）对导航训练中相对姿态估计能力的影响。

Result: 发现模拟器设置会影响结果，但能力可部分迁移到更真实场景；导航性能与相对姿态估计能力相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习在图像目标导航中可行，但需注意模拟器设置的影响；相对姿态估计能力是重要子技能。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了鲁棒、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过动态分配表示容量，提升了开放世界场景中的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Conclusion: 剪枝与视觉模型表示之间存在复杂的相互作用，强调了研究剪枝何时及如何有益于视觉表示的重要性。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了交互生成质量，并提供了可行的评估指标。

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn在生成3D人-物交互时表现出色，同时保持了推理效率。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

Result: DeRIS在非和多目标场景中表现优异，无需专门架构修改。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化分析和机制改进，显著提升了RIS任务的性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

Motivation: 探索ViTs在3D医学图像分割中的应用，尤其是针对IAC的自动化量化，以减少对昂贵手动标注的依赖。

Method: 使用MAE框架预训练ViTs，并在IST-3临床试验数据上微调，用于IAC分割。

Result: ViTs在Dice分数上优于nnU-Net基线3.2分，对高切片厚度更鲁棒，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像分割中具有潜力，尤其是通过自监督学习减少标注需求并提高性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

Motivation: 冰川冰量流失加剧，需高精度监测技术理解前缘消融和崩解过程。现有模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出自监督预训练技术（SSL4SAR数据集）和混合模型架构（Swin Transformer编码器+残差CNN解码器）。

Result: 新模型在CaFFe数据集上平均距离误差293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差75米，接近人类水平38米。

Conclusion: 该技术能精确监测冰川前缘季节性变化，为冰川研究提供重要工具。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

Motivation: 现有基于自回归的视觉生成模型因量化过程导致信息损失，影响图像保真度；连续标记虽避免量化但建模难度大且易产生分布外伪影。

Method: 提出DisCon框架，通过建模离散标记条件下的连续表示概率，结合离散与连续标记的优势。

Conclusion: DisCon通过离散-连续混合建模，有效平衡了生成质量与建模难度，为视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

*Montasir Shams,Chashi Mahiul Islam,Shaeke Salman,Phat Tran,Xiuwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (ViTs) in medical imaging lack semantic meaningfulness in representations, making them vulnerable to small changes and unreliable for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether ViT representations in medical imaging are semantically meaningful and robust, given their widespread use despite limited understanding.

Method: A projected gradient-based algorithm is used to analyze the semantic meaningfulness and robustness of ViT representations.

Result: ViT representations are not semantically meaningful; small changes can drastically alter representations, leading to unreliable classification (e.g., 60% accuracy drop).

Conclusion: This work highlights a critical vulnerability in ViTs for medical imaging, posing challenges for their use in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Motivation: 对抗样本的可转移性对深度神经网络构成安全威胁，现有方法多关注单尺度图像，无法有效应对防御模型。

Method: 使用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均以确定对抗扰动。

Result: SGP方法显著提高了攻击成功率，平均提升2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种可扩展性强的方法，易于与现有攻击技术结合，有效增强对抗样本的可转移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化中表现不佳，需要复杂调整或联合优化。

Result: FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA提供了一种简单且通用的多主题个性化解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督方法解决了3D VQA模型中推理路径监督不足的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

Motivation: 现有研究仅依赖基础模型的预测误差，忽视了长尾轨迹模式的多样性和不确定性，导致复杂和危险场景预测不足。

Method: 提出AMD框架，结合改进的动量对比学习（MoCo-DT）和解耦对比学习（DCL），并设计四种轨迹随机增强方法和在线迭代聚类策略。

Result: AMD在长尾轨迹预测中表现最优，且整体预测精度突出。

Conclusion: AMD通过动态更新伪标签和适应长尾数据分布，显著提升了复杂轨迹的预测能力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: SPRED框架通过动态原型引导和双知识协作，解决了半监督终身行人重识别中的噪声问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中标注资源有限，现有方法在未标记数据利用中性能下降严重，需要解决噪声知识问题。

Method: 引入可学习的身份原型动态生成高质量伪标签，并通过双知识协作方案净化噪声。

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，有效提升了未标记数据的利用和长期学习的知识传播。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，用于解决复杂假设性指令的图像编辑问题，通过多模态大语言模型和细粒度推理线索提取模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理需要深层推理的复杂假设性指令，且缺乏相关数据集和细粒度细节提取机制。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合MLLMs和FRCE模块，并引入跨模态增强器（CME）减少语义损失。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优于现有方法，并具备零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数字孪生（DT）的管道，用于评估胃肠道（GI）器官变形图像配准（DIR）的准确性，并验证剂量映射的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间精度指标，如手动标记的解剖标志，但对于高度移动的GI器官来说难以实现。因此，开发了患者特异性数字孪生模型来模拟动态运动，以评估DIR方法的准确性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个运动阶段的4D序列，模拟GI运动。使用11个数据集（包括MRI和CT扫描）评估DIR方法，并通过目标配准误差、Dice相似系数和Hausdorff距离等指标进行分析。

Result: 数字孪生模型成功模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度和Jacobian行列式与真实患者数据接近。该方法能够提取详细的DIR性能指标，并验证剂量映射的准确性。

Conclusion: 该管道为动态且解剖复杂的区域提供了严格的DIR工具测试方法，实现了空间和剂量学的精确评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多季节信息融合框架，用于果园自动化管理，通过结合休眠期和生长期的RGB-D图像，实现高精度的3D重建和模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，生长期茂密的树叶会遮挡树结构，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠期树冠结构更清晰可见。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，结合多季节数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg的MSE为0.0047，分割mAP@50达0.78；Kinect Fusion的RMSE为5.23 mm（树干直径）；Fast GICP的最小适应分数为0.00197。

Conclusion: 该框架通过融合多季节数据，克服了生长期遮挡问题，提升了修剪和疏果等自动化操作的精度。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom是一个统一的图像定制框架，通过上下文学习整合位置感知和无位置定制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用场景的需求。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用多模态注意力机制和任务导向的注册令牌，结合高质量数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好度提升73%，仅训练0.4%的模型参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLP在视觉任务中的应用，并通过事件驱动机制减少冗余计算。

Method: 提出evMLP，利用事件驱动局部更新机制选择性处理图像或特征图中的变化区域。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，视频数据集上显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: evMLP在保持性能的同时，通过事件驱动机制有效提升计算效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at
https://github.com/i-evi/evMLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集主要由孤立的文本-视频对组成，无法支持连贯的多片段视频序列建模。

Method: 引入CI-VID数据集，包含34万多个样本，每个样本包含连贯的视频剪辑序列和文本描述，支持文本和视频到视频（TV2V）生成。

Result: 实验表明，使用CI-VID训练的模型在生成视频序列时，准确性和内容一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: CI-VID数据集在故事驱动内容的生成中表现出色，具有高质量和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

Motivation: 长动画色彩一致性在现有研究中被忽视，局部范式无法满足需求，需动态全局-局部方法。

Method: 提出LongAnimation框架，包含SketchDiT、DGLM模块和色彩一致性奖励，动态融合全局历史特征。

Result: 在短时（14帧）和长时（平均500帧）动画上验证了色彩一致性的有效性。

Conclusion: LongAnimation在开放域动画色彩化任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练扩散模型的微调，受限于时间和语义/布局差异，FreeMorph旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1) 提出指导感知的球形插值设计，通过修改自注意力模块解决身份丢失问题；2) 引入步骤导向的变化趋势，混合自注意力模块以实现可控过渡。

Result: FreeMorph比现有方法快10~50倍，并建立了图像变形的新标准。

Conclusion: FreeMorph通过创新设计解决了图像变形中的挑战，成为无需调优的高效方法。

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现出一定的通用性，但仍需改进几何任务处理能力，并注意生成模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) accelerates autoregressive image generation by introducing flexible parallelized modeling and locality-aware ordering, reducing steps significantly without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive image generation is memory-bound and slow; existing parallelization methods achieve limited speedup.

Method: LPD uses Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling (learnable position queries) and Locality-aware Generation Ordering (dependency-minimizing groups).

Result: Reduces generation steps from 256 to 20 (256x256) and 1024 to 48 (512x512), with 3.4x lower latency than prior methods.

Conclusion: LPD achieves high parallelization and quality in autoregressive image generation, significantly reducing latency.

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

Abstract: Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its
clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity,
distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based
methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models,
providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance
model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This
systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt
engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including
textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze
their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and
classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve
task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency
and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater
model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite
substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in
prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for
clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future
trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical
integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating
the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.

Motivation: 解决传统CNN在下采样过程中丢失特征信息的问题，并提升模型对输入图像相关区域的关注能力。

Method: 结合ResNet-D模块改进下采样层，并在瓶颈层引入卷积注意力模块，使用数据增强技术处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现出色，如LC2500数据集准确率/F1达98.14/98.14%，IQ-OTH/NCCD数据集达99.25/99.13%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: ResNet+模型在肺癌和肺部疾病预测中优于基线模型，具有更高的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) in medical image analysis has significantly
improved the ability to predict lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a
novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named ResNet+, which is
based on the established ResNet framework. This model is specifically designed
to improve the prediction of lung cancer and diseases using the images. To
address the challenge of missing feature information that occurs during the
downsampling process in CNNs, we integrate the ResNet-D module, a variant
designed to enhance feature extraction capabilities by modifying the
downsampling layers, into the traditional ResNet model. Furthermore, a
convolutional attention module was incorporated into the bottleneck layers to
enhance model generalization by allowing the network to focus on relevant
regions of the input images. We evaluated the proposed model using five public
datasets, comprising lung cancer (LC2500 $n$=3183, IQ-OTH/NCCD $n$=1336, and
LCC $n$=25000 images) and lung disease (ChestXray $n$=5856, and COVIDx-CT
$n$=425024 images). To address class imbalance, we used data augmentation
techniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented
classes in the training dataset. The experimental results show that ResNet+
model demonstrated remarkable accuracy/F1, reaching 98.14/98.14\% on the
LC25000 dataset and 99.25/99.13\% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Furthermore, the
ResNet+ model saved computational cost compared to the original ResNet series
in predicting lung cancer images. The proposed model outperformed the baseline
models on publicly available datasets, achieving better performance metrics.

Abstract: PanTS is a large-scale, multi-institutional dataset curated to advance
research in pancreatic CT analysis. It contains 36,390 CT scans from 145
medical centers, with expert-validated, voxel-wise annotations of over 993,000
anatomical structures, covering pancreatic tumors, pancreas head, body, and
tail, and 24 surrounding anatomical structures such as vascular/skeletal
structures and abdominal/thoracic organs. Each scan includes metadata such as
patient age, sex, diagnosis, contrast phase, in-plane spacing, slice thickness,
etc. AI models trained on PanTS achieve significantly better performance in
pancreatic tumor detection, localization, and segmentation compared to those

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管分割在医学图像中至关重要，但现有方法常因血管细长和先验建模不足导致分割不连续。

Method: SWinMamba通过蛇形窗口序列自适应分割输入图像，结合双向聚合模块和空间-频率融合单元增强特征表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，SWinMamba能够实现完整且连续的血管分割。

Conclusion: SWinMamba通过创新的建模方法显著提升了血管分割的准确性和连续性。

Abstract: Vascular segmentation in medical images is crucial for disease diagnosis and
surgical navigation. However, the segmented vascular structure is often
discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this
paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve
accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the
continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window
sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window
sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global
visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine
Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping
serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for
vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM)
integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity
representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion
Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular
structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that
the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and
connected vessels.

<details>

Motivation: MR图像中存在的强度不均匀性影响了医学分析的定性和定量结果，现有深度学习模型缺乏对图像结构和偏置场平滑性的约束。

Method: S2DNets通过引入分段结构约束和偏置场平滑性进行网络训练，有效去除不均匀强度并保留更多结构细节。

Result: 在临床和模拟MR数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于传统和基于深度学习的方法，并在下游分割任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: S2DNets通过结构和平滑性约束显著提升了MR图像的校正效果，为医学分析提供了更高质量的图像。

Abstract: MR imaging techniques are of great benefit to disease diagnosis. However, due
to the limitation of MR devices, significant intensity inhomogeneity often
exists in imaging results, which impedes both qualitative and quantitative
medical analysis. Recently, several unsupervised deep learning-based models
have been proposed for MR image improvement. However, these models merely
concentrate on global appearance learning, and neglect constraints from image
structures and smoothness of bias field, leading to distorted corrected
results. In this paper, novel structure and smoothness constrained dual
networks, named S2DNets, are proposed aiming to self-supervised bias field
correction. S2DNets introduce piece-wise structural constraints and smoothness
of bias field for network training to effectively remove non-uniform intensity
and retain much more structural details. Extensive experiments executed on both
clinical and simulated MR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms
other conventional and deep learning-based models. In addition to comparison on
visual metrics, downstream MR image segmentation tasks are also used to
evaluate the impact of the proposed model. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: BronchoGAN利用解剖学约束和中间深度图像表示，实现了跨不同支气管镜输入域的稳健图像翻译，生成具有真实外观的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于支气管镜图像的稀缺性，需要一种方法生成大规模训练数据以支持深度学习模型。

Method: 提出BronchoGAN，将解剖学约束（如支气管孔匹配）和基础模型生成的深度图像作为中间表示，集成到条件GAN中。

Result: 实验表明，BronchoGAN能成功翻译不同域的输入图像，并显著提升合成图像的解剖学准确性（如Dice系数提高0.43）。

Conclusion: BronchoGAN填补了公共支气管镜图像数据的空白，为临床应用提供了大规模、真实的图像数据集。

Abstract: The limited availability of bronchoscopy images makes image synthesis
particularly interesting for training deep learning models. Robust image
translation across different domains -- virtual bronchoscopy, phantom as well
as in-vivo and ex-vivo image data -- is pivotal for clinical applications. This
paper proposes BronchoGAN introducing anatomical constraints for image-to-image
translation being integrated into a conditional GAN. In particular, we force
bronchial orifices to match across input and output images. We further propose
to use foundation model-generated depth images as intermediate representation
ensuring robustness across a variety of input domains establishing models with
substantially less reliance on individual training datasets. Moreover our
intermediate depth image representation allows to easily construct paired image
data for training. Our experiments showed that input images from different
domains (e.g. virtual bronchoscopy, phantoms) can be successfully translated to
images mimicking realistic human airway appearance. We demonstrated that
anatomical settings (i.e. bronchial orifices) can be robustly preserved with
our approach which is shown qualitatively and quantitatively by means of
improved FID, SSIM and dice coefficients scores. Our anatomical constraints
enabled an improvement in the Dice coefficient of up to 0.43 for synthetic
images. Through foundation models for intermediate depth representations,
bronchial orifice segmentation integrated as anatomical constraints into
conditional GANs we are able to robustly translate images from different
bronchoscopy input domains. BronchoGAN allows to incorporate public CT scan
data (virtual bronchoscopy) in order to generate large-scale bronchoscopy image
datasets with realistic appearance. BronchoGAN enables to bridge the gap of
missing public bronchoscopy images.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Estimating brain age from structural MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for
characterizing normative and pathological aging. In this work, we explore
contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to supervised
approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss
function, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public
neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four
key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data
consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean
absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to
site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size
increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in
patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through
brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike
supervised baselines, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation
between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting
its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position
contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and
clinically meaningful brain representations.

Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高且耗时，因此需要高效、自动化的训练方法。

Method: 提出ADA-SAM，结合类激活图和梯度反馈机制，优化半监督分割分支。

Result: 在真实临床数据上验证，ADA-SAM在有限标注条件下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: ADA-SAM为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a key task in the imaging workflow, influencing
many image-based decisions. Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models
rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through
manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone
process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient
methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated,
domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask
learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class
activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the
semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything
(SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient
feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation
and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and
improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world
clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our
proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines
by double digits in limited label settings. Our code is available at:

Motivation: LDCT在肺癌筛查中应用广泛，但放射科医生短缺限制了其大规模应用。TANGERINE旨在提供一个可扩展、资源高效的解决方案。

Method: TANGERINE基于自监督学习预训练，采用3D掩码自编码器框架，支持少量数据和计算资源下的微调。

Result: 在14种疾病分类任务中达到最先进性能，包括肺癌和多种呼吸系统疾病，且在不同临床中心表现稳健。

Conclusion: TANGERINE的开源、轻量设计为快速集成到下一代医学影像工具奠定了基础，有望推动肺癌筛查向全面呼吸疾病管理转变。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening
(LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a
generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related
early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of
radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a
computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT
analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can
be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with
limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained
from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,
thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label
efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of
fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000
thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public
datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease
classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,
while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a
masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable
solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive
models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest
computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays
the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools
that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular
focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management
in high-risk populations.

Motivation: 传统分类方法在快速响应和成本效率方面表现不佳，尤其是在趋势适应和紧急升级场景中。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）框架训练基础嵌入模型，包括单模态和多模态架构，并设计了一个嵌入检索系统。

Result: 离线实验显示EBR将ROC-AUC从0.85提升至0.99，PR-AUC从0.35提升至0.95；在线实验显示EBR提高了10.32%的行动率并降低80%以上的运营成本。

Conclusion: EBR方法在视频内容审核中表现出更高的效率、性能和灵活性，优于传统分类方法。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short
video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While
classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often
struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as
trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an
Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional
classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both
single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior
performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and
MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the
embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video
retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive
offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves
ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online
experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces
operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and
flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.

Motivation: 现有防御方法未能揭示多模态漏洞的根本原因，导致对文本驱动的多模态越狱攻击仍显脆弱。

Method: 提出SafePTR框架，选择性修剪早期-中层的有害令牌并恢复良性特征。

Result: 实验表明，SafePTR在三个MLLMs和五个基准测试中显著提升了安全性且不影响效率。

Conclusion: SafePTR通过精确修剪少量有害令牌，有效提升MLLMs的安全性，无需额外训练开销。

Abstract: By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also
introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal
jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,
including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety
Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'
built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of
multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger
jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven
multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing
heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive
analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in
MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers
are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of
precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety
tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by
this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense
framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while
restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional
computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs
while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five
benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating
jailbreak risks without compromising utility.

Result: 开发了自动分析食品晶体图像的工具，提高了效率和准确性，并通过平台实现了安全使用。

Conclusion: 平台成功解决了数据隐私问题，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because
of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their
proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This
paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may
safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those
researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world
problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform
for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate
this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem
in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality
control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals
in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and
time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal
analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool
enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers
from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample
preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high
resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also
developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged
for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the
originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while
keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,
future directions are also explored.

Abstract: The installation of solar energy systems is on the rise, and therefore,
appropriate maintenance techniques are required to be used in order to maintain
maximum performance levels. One of the major challenges is the automated
discrimination between clean and dirty solar panels. This paper presents a
novel Dual Ensemble Neural Network (DENN) to classify solar panels using
image-based features. The suggested approach utilizes the advantages offered by
various ensemble models by integrating them into a dual framework, aimed at
improving both classification accuracy and robustness. The DENN model is
evaluated in comparison to current ensemble methods, showcasing its superior
performance across a range of assessment metrics. The proposed approach
performs the best compared to other methods and reaches state-of-the-art
accuracy on experimental results for the Deep Solar Eye dataset, effectively
serving predictive maintenance purposes in solar energy systems. It reveals the
potential of hybrid ensemble learning techniques to further advance the
prospects of automated solar panel inspections as a scalable solution to
real-world challenges.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and
efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing
communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and
perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information
completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have
largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of
collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges
requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to
explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural
language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly
to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling
the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it
transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into
proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in
intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as
LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their
integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge
encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for
enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational
commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation.
Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations
of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of
the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation
on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system
reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies,
establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous
driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed
decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion
prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,
which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic
rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting
model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and
road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of
driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to
merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns
holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.
Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory
usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning
mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and
semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the
limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more
informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and
advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We
verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion
forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while
achieving improved performance.

Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging,
yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity
remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables
voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical
regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this
study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age
from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D
CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key
hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus,
posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal
lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age.
Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals
distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These
findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal
aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover
biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，探索其内部机制如何影响模态偏好。

Result: 模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，且内部注意力机制可调整模态偏好。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和控制多模态模型在冲突信号下的行为提供了基础。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Motivation: 探索视觉和语言模型是否能够通过优化实现表示对齐，从而验证柏拉图表示假设。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过轻量级Pareto高效框架可以实现模态间的表示对齐，验证了柏拉图表示假设的可行性。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择共同影响持续学习中的学习动态，揭示了任务间复杂的交互机制。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.
