### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的新方法，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的速度限制和传感器不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试对高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT方法，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来减少跨传感器不一致。

Result: SimULi比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化方法快1.5-10倍，在相机和深度误差上比现有方法减少高达40%，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过现有最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，为自动驾驶系统的高保真模拟测试提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习重新定义手术未来预测，使用师生架构和动作动力学模块，在多个数据集和任务上实现一致的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解当前事件而非预测未来事件，现有方法缺乏统一的短期和长期预测方法，且难以泛化到不同手术场景。

Method: 提出SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，使用师生架构和Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类压缩视频片段为状态表示，通过Action Dynamics模块指导学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序迁移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 状态变化学习的方法能够有效解决手术未来预测的挑战，为手术室安全和效率提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为TMPS的目标感知度量学习框架，通过优先采样策略解决植物病害诊断模型在跨域场景下的泛化问题，仅使用少量目标域样本即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习植物病害诊断系统虽然在训练数据上表现良好，但在实际部署时遇到不同环境条件（如光照、背景等）的图像时诊断准确率显著下降，这主要是由于训练数据多样性不足导致的域差距问题。

Method: 提出TMPS（Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling）框架，基于度量学习思想，利用少量目标域标注样本，通过优先采样策略来增强模型对目标域的适应能力。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每类病害10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线方法在宏平均F1分数上分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习方法提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架通过有效利用少量目标域样本，显著提升了植物病害诊断模型在跨域场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决实际部署中的域适应问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言模型增强框架，通过主动对齐视觉和语言表征特征来改进图像描述生成，无需文本标签或完全重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: ViZer在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表征特征，使现有VLM无需文本标签或完全重新训练即可生成改进的描述。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成比基线更接地气和描述性的描述。

Conclusion: ViZer为零标签视觉语言任务提供了实用的起点，自动化评估指标如CIDEr和BERTScore往往惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医学AI系统，通过引入显性认知解耦(SED)方法，在胎儿超声报告生成和诊断任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图推理、多种疾病和图像多样性的挑战。

Method: 提出显性认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，通过强化学习解耦视图-疾病关联，并沿临床步骤进行偏好选择。同时构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线方法，平均提升14%，在关键条件下的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流程引导的SED方法，有效解决了胎儿超声领域的挑战，为医学AI在胎儿超声应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导框架，通过ZeResFDG模块实现频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影，结合光谱EMA和QSilk稳定器，在不重新训练的情况下提升图像锐度、提示符遵循和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决SD/SDXL模型在采样过程中存在的细节模糊、提示符遵循不足和伪影问题，同时保持适中的引导尺度，作者提出了一个无需重新训练的采样器级引导框架。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG包含三个组件：(i)频率解耦引导，重新加权引导信号的低频和高频分量；(ii)能量重缩放，匹配引导预测与正分支的每样本幅度；(iii)零投影，移除与无条件方向平行的分量。此外，采用轻量级光谱EMA进行保守和细节寻求模式切换，以及QSilk微粒度稳定器进行量化钳位和深度/边缘门控微细节注入。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器中，ZeResFDG在中等引导尺度下显著提升了图像锐度、提示符遵循和伪影控制能力，同时QSilk稳定器提高了鲁棒性并生成了自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5框架通过采样器级引导技术有效提升了SD/SDXL模型的生成质量，无需重新训练即可实现细节增强和稳定性改进，具有良好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE提出了一种混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，相比传统堆叠编码器方法，在减少24-49%计算量的同时性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通过堆叠多个视觉编码器来提升性能，但这种方法会导致计算成本急剧增加且收益递减。需要一种更智能的编码器选择机制来平衡性能和效率。

Method: SCOPE采用混合编码器框架，包含一个共享编码器和多个路由编码器。通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来动态选择最优编码器。使用双重熵正则化和辅助损失来训练路由器，平衡数据集级负载分布和实例级路由置信度。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器+1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型，在性能上超越了同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时计算量减少了24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择比暴力聚合更有效，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式，为高效VLMs设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了时空视频动作定位（SVAG）新任务，要求模型基于自然语言描述同时检测、跟踪并时间定位视频中的参考对象，并构建了大规模基准SVAG-Bench和基线框架SVAGFormer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要关注粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽略了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并时间定位的挑战，这限制了下一代AI系统的发展。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配先进视觉语言模型进行联合时空定位，并开发标准化评估工具包SVAGEval。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，尤其在密集或复杂场景中，突显了对长视频中细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级推理的需求。

Conclusion: SVAG任务揭示了当前视频理解技术的局限性，为开发能够处理复杂时空推理的AI系统提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqBench是一个用于评估文本到视频生成中序列叙事连贯性的基准测试，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并提出了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频生成模型在视觉质量上取得了进展，但在生成需要逻辑进展的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，现有基准主要关注视觉质量而忽略了叙事连贯性评估。

Method: 设计了包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖不同叙事复杂度，并开发了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标来捕捉长距离依赖和时序关系。

Result: 评估揭示了当前文本到视频模型的局限性：在多动作序列中难以保持对象状态一致性、多对象场景中出现物理上不合理的结果、难以保持时序动作之间的现实时序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估文本到视频生成的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt是一个通过两阶段适配将场景感知注入文本条件运动生成模型的框架，利用分离的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集来解决现有方法无法同时处理运动语义和场景感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动具有多样性和语义丰富性，同时受到周围场景的影响。现有运动生成方法要么只关注运动语义，要么只关注场景感知，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段适配：1）中间帧生成阶段：通过可学习的中间帧生成作为代理任务，在不依赖文本的情况下连接两个不同数据集；2）场景感知中间帧生成阶段：添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt能有效将场景感知注入文本到运动模型，并分析了这种感知能力的出现机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了文本条件运动生成中场景感知的缺失问题，通过创新的两阶段适配方法实现了语义丰富且场景感知的运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合卷积特征提取和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架（1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba），用于心电图的异常检测，在PhysioNet挑战赛上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型（如残差网络和Transformer）在处理长序列心电信号时性能有限，需要更高效的序列建模方法来提高心电图异常检测的准确性。

Method: 提出1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba混合框架，将一维卷积神经网络的特征提取能力与Mamba选择性状态空间模型相结合，基于Vision Mamba的双向变体增强心电图数据中时间依赖关系的表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛上的实验表明，该模型在12导联心电图上的AUPRC和AUROC得分显著高于之前发表的最佳算法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是首个无需几何先验的自我监督新视角合成模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案实现真正的姿态可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成模型预测的姿态缺乏可迁移性——同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新视角合成。

Method: XFactor结合成对姿态估计和简单的输入输出增强方案，共同实现相机姿态与场景内容的解耦，并促进几何推理。该方法使用无约束的潜在姿态变量，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态新视角合成变换器，通过大规模实验证明其实现真正的姿态可迁移性，且潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何先验即可实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督3D理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

Motivation: 现有的图像融合方法通常将梯度信息压缩为幅度，丢失了方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不佳。

Method: 设计了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，在多个尺度上分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并保留其符号信息，提供明确的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公开基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能够产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘，并保留更丰富的纹理信息，且无需改变模型架构或训练协议。

Conclusion: 方向感知的多尺度梯度损失为图像融合提供了更有效的监督信号，显著提升了融合质量，特别是在边缘清晰度和纹理保留方面。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的无监督域自适应框架，专门针对医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，特别是内容变化，在跨域海马体分割任务中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分割中面临领域偏移问题，包括图像外观（风格）和人口相关的解剖特征（内容）的变化，这导致模型在不同数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 结合高效的z-归一化风格协调和双向可变形图像配准策略，配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像和目标域。

Result: 在从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者的海马体分割任务中，相比标准增强方法，Dice得分相对提高了15%，在内容偏移较大的场景中改进最为明显。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨域海马体分割中表现出色，特别是在处理显著内容偏移时，验证了框架在多样化人群中实现准确海马体分割的有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种系统量化扩散概率模型中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集并开发了标准化评估协议，揭示了FID等常用指标无法有效捕捉计数幻觉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件（包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand），定义了明确的计数标准。开发了标准化评估协议，系统分析了不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉水平的影响。

Result: 研究发现FID等广泛使用的图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，揭示了现有评估指标的局限性。不同采样条件对计数幻觉水平有显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作是系统量化扩散模型中幻觉现象的第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新的见解，有助于设计下一代受事实约束的生成模型。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一个轻量级的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征内存和特征传播机制显著降低计算开销，同时保持时间一致性和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在高计算开销、内存消耗大以及视觉保真度不足的问题，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征内存库(SFM)缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)方法保持时间一致性，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码进行精细编辑。

Result: 实验表明Edit-Your-Interest在效率和视觉保真度上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持背景完整性的同时实现了高效准确的视频编辑，具有优越的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于提升AI在AR/VR环境中感知社交动态和干预时机的能力，显著提升了现有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR/VR技术普及需要AI具备从第一人称视角理解社交动态的能力，但当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，常在不恰当时机干预，破坏自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的EgoSocial数据集，并提出EgoSoD方法，通过整合多模态上下文线索（音频、视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: EgoSoD方法在干预时机检测上使Phi-4提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；在整体社交互动性能上分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法能有效提升AI对社交动态的感知能力，解决了当前OLLMs在干预时机检测上的不足，为AR/VR环境中的智能助手提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Motivation: 当前最先进的自动驾驶评估指标（如EPDMS）在复杂场景中缺乏上下文感知能力，无法准确反映人类判断标准。

Method: 提出DriveCritic框架：1）DriveCritic数据集 - 包含需要上下文判断的挑战性场景，标注了人类偏好对；2）DriveCritic模型 - 基于视觉语言模型，采用两阶段监督学习和强化学习流程进行微调，整合视觉和符号上下文来评估轨迹对。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了一个更可靠、更符合人类判断的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 改进过去的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准工作，旨在实现高配准精度的同时控制变换质量，确保空间变换的正雅可比行列式并提供准确的逆变换近似。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、计算变换的规则性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg在微分同胚图像配准中表现出色，提供了更高质量的变换和更准确的逆映射，在计算解剖学和形态计量学中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Conclusion: OS-HGAdapter通过LLM增强文本信息熵和超图适配器优化，有效解决了跨模态语义对齐的熵不平衡问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision

Conclusion: 基于TEM信号固有物理特性的字典驱动先验正则化测试时自适应方法能够有效提升模型在新环境中的去噪性能，为跨区域TEM信号处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向边缘高斯泼溅(EGS)场景的样本后传输策略(STT-GS)，通过特征域聚类和联合客户端选择与功率控制来最大化GS质量，解决了传统方法不适用的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，而EGS明确旨在最大化GS质量，导致现有方法不适用。需要专门针对GS优化的资源管理方案。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：1）使用特征域聚类(FDC)从客户端采样代表性图像作为导频数据；2）开发联合客户端选择与功率控制(JCSPC)框架；3）基于惩罚交替主化最小化(PAMM)算法求解非凸优化问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法在真实数据集上显著优于现有基准，GS导向目标函数可在低采样率(如10%)下准确预测，在视图贡献和通信成本之间实现了优秀权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案有效解决了EGS场景下的资源管理问题，通过两阶段采样和传输策略实现了GS质量的最大化。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: MimicParts是一个用于从语音生成风格化3D人体运动的框架，通过分区感知风格注入和去噪网络解决现有方法忽略区域运动风格差异和动态适应性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么过度简化风格多样性，要么忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身vs下身），且未能让运动风格动态适应语音节奏和情感变化，限制了运动真实性

Method: 提出分区感知风格注入和分区感知去噪网络，将身体分为不同区域编码局部运动风格，并通过分区感知注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法，生成的运动序列在自然性和表现力方面表现更好

Conclusion: MimicParts框架能够捕捉细粒度区域差异，并确保生成的运动与语音节奏和情感状态的变化保持一致，提升了风格化3D人体运动生成的质量

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT的概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这两种技术及其应用的系统区分，需要澄清概念并提供清晰的路线图。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT的设计，提出统一的PA框架，建立分类法将现有方法分为可学习、生成和不可学习提示，并按注入粒度（像素级和标记级）进一步组织。

Result: 构建了全面的PA方法论和应用综述，涵盖医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等多个领域，总结了当前基准并识别了关键挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究人员和从业者提供了理解PA相关研究演变格局的清晰路线图，强调了PA作为轻量级适应方法的有效性和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性和低对比度等挑战，现有模型在像素重叠指标上表现良好但样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 基于共享编码器架构的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，样本级监督调制特征分布并持续提升小缺陷的召回率，分割分支保留边界细节。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心框架和决策关联评估指标有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的核心瓶颈，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

TL;DR: 该论文针对视觉语言模型在否定理解上的缺陷（肯定性偏见），提出了CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块，通过改进token合并机制来提升否定检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定概念时存在严重缺陷，特别是在描述性物体检测任务中表现出明显的肯定性偏见，这限制了模型在真实世界检测应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出了两个主要贡献：1）CoVAND数据集，使用思维链和VQA管道生成高质量的实例基础否定数据；2）NegToMe模块，通过token合并技术将否定词与属性词绑定成语义短语，解决tokenization过程中的否定线索丢失问题，并结合LoRA微调方法。

Result: 该方法在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，误报率降低，在OVDEval上NMS-AP提升高达+10.8分，并展示了在SoTA VLMs上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型的否定理解能力提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互机制，能够在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、多段线、线段），在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构分别训练模型。这源于将实例属性（类别、结构）和几何属性（点坐标、连接）独立处理，限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块进行跨层级上下文交换的迭代更新，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架，成功解决了多类型矢量提取的问题，为矢量提取领域提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型生成的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更动态和自适应的目标建模方法。

Method: 提出显式提示将空间运动信息转化为自然语言描述，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器来提升视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack上的大量实验表明，EPIPTrack在不同场景下优于现有跟踪器，展现出强大的适应性和优越性能。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过动态显式和隐式提示有效解决了多模态跟踪中的适应性挑战，为实时目标跟踪提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Motivation: VLA模型在机器人学习领域取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。本文旨在探索VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出有效的防御方法。

Method: 提出了EDPA攻击方法，通过优化两个目标：(i)破坏视觉与文本潜在表示的语义对齐；(ii)最大化对抗样本与干净样本潜在表示的差异。同时提出了对抗性微调防御策略，使视觉编码器对干净和对抗样本产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试中，EDPA显著提高了前沿VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御方法有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击和防御策略为提升VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准和CymbaDiff方法为户外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估和有效解决方案

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得了进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不清楚，需要系统性的可解释性分析。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术，分析不同视频问答任务中模型的内部信息流模式，包括注意力机制和表示对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频大语言模型进行时间推理的具体机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Motivation: 现有端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了各种模态的联合表示学习。为了统一多模态处理，需要一种新的架构来克服这一限制。

Method: 提出MDM架构，利用Mamba-based多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器进行编码和解码，逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型（MonoFormer、LlamaGen、Chameleon等），并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro、Mistral等SOTA模型有效竞争。

Conclusion: MDM在多模态处理统一化方面表现出有效性，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal

*Keyan Zhou,Zecheng Tang,Lingfeng Ming,Guanghao Zhou,Qiguang Chen,Dan Qiao,Zheming Yang,Libo Qin,Minghui Qiu,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLongCite是一个评估大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中保真度的基准测试，涵盖8个任务、6种上下文长度区间和多种模态，发现现有模型在长多模态上下文处理中保真度有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不能保证有效利用上下文，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。当前评估主要关注纯文本领域，而多模态评估仅限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准测试，包含8个不同任务，跨越6个上下文长度区间，整合文本、图像和视频等多种模态。对最先进的LVLMs进行评估，并深入分析上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型保真度的影响。

Result: 评估显示现有LVLMs在处理长多模态上下文时的保真度有限。

Conclusion: 需要改进LVLMs的长上下文处理能力，MMLongCite为评估多模态长上下文保真度提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [40] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MaskDCPT的掩码退化分类预训练方法，用于图像退化类型分类和图像恢复预训练，通过结合掩码图像建模和对比学习实现通用图像恢复任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中存在局限性，需要一种能够识别退化类型并实现全面图像恢复的预训练方法。

Method: MaskDCPT包含编码器和两个解码器：编码器从掩码低质量输入图像提取特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像。

Result: 在5D全能恢复任务中PSNR至少提高3.77dB，真实世界退化场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT是一种简单而有效的预训练方法，可为通用图像恢复任务提供优秀性能，同时发布了包含250万对恢复样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分类为发票、报告、信件和表单四种类型，支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获，在各种挑战性条件下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中文档图像分类面临的挑战，如光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率等复杂场景下的文档分类需求。

Method: 采用四阶段流水线：图像捕获与预处理、基于DBNet++的文本检测、基于BART的文本分类，使用Python和PyQt5实现用户界面。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，表明该方法在无约束成像场景下具有实用价值。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法对于实际混合来源文档分类在非受控成像环境下是有效的，能够处理各种现实世界中的挑战性条件。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法(3D-NCD)，通过结构因果模型(SCM)来学习基础类和新型类之间的因果表示和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云分割中新类发现问题，目标是利用已标注的基础类监督来分割未标注的新型类。关键在于建立点表示与基础类标签之间的精确关联，以及基础类和新型类之间的表示关联。

Method: 提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法：1) 使用SCM分析基础类表示中的隐藏混杂因子；2) 设计因果表示原型来消除混杂因子，捕获基础类的因果表示；3) 使用图结构建模基础类因果表示原型与新型类原型之间的因果关系，实现从基础类到新型类的因果推理。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入结构因果模型和因果推理机制，能够有效解决3D点云分割中的新类发现问题，提高分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，通过优化稀疏感知的束调整和全局定位技术，在保持精度的同时实现了40倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在处理大规模场景时存在计算效率低的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在GPU内存消耗方面存在限制。本文旨在利用GPU并行计算潜力解决这些瓶颈。

Method: 基于稀疏感知束调整优化技术，将GPU并行计算应用于标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速束调整和全局定位。

Result: 在包含5000张图像的大规模数据集上，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的速度提升，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统SfM方法的计算效率问题和深度学习方法的GPU内存限制问题，为大规模场景重建提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [44] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提高了事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用通用的视觉增强技术，忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了缓解LVLM幻觉问题的效果。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小，充分利用逻辑分布信息。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在事实一致性方面显著优于最先进的解码方法。

Conclusion: 集成查询依赖的增强和熵感知解码对于提高LVLM的有效生成至关重要。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探索大型多模态模型（特别是GPT-4o）在理解视觉有趣性概念方面的能力，通过比较分析发现人类评估与GPT-4o预测存在部分对齐，并利用这种对齐来训练学习排序模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中，我们被消费和看到的内容高度影响。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉有趣性）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型在视觉和文本数据上的训练展现出强大能力，研究者希望探索这些模型是否能捕捉视觉有趣性的概念。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o的预测，研究两者在视觉有趣性上的对齐程度。利用GPT-4o对图像对进行有趣性标注，并将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉有趣性评估上存在部分对齐，且GPT-4o的表现优于现有最先进方法。这允许有效标注图像对的有趣性，用于知识蒸馏。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够有效捕捉视觉有趣性概念，为深入理解人类兴趣提供了新的途径，展示了大型多模态模型在感知任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

### [46] [Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317)
*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积，显著提高推理速度和降低内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成本体积在现代光流估计器中普遍使用，但其计算和空间复杂性限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。经验观察发现，一旦其他网络部分充分训练后，成本体积的重要性会降低。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除成本体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，速度提升1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 该训练策略证明了在不牺牲精度的情况下，可以显著优化光流估计器的效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测技术（如毫米波、微波等）存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要开发实时、低成本且保护隐私的解决方案。

Result: DEF-YOLO能够在热成像均匀区域自适应聚焦目标定位，在保持速度和吞吐量的同时，为热成像隐蔽武器检测建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了热成像在隐蔽武器检测中的有效性，提出的DEF-YOLO架构和TICW数据集为该领域提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Group-VQ方法，通过分组优化码本来解决VQ-VAE中的码本崩溃问题，同时引入训练后码本重采样方法实现码本大小的灵活调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE模型存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但这些方法限制了码本的学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出Group-VQ方法，对码本进行分组优化，每个组独立优化，组内进行联合优化。同时引入无需训练的码本重采样方法，可在训练后调整码本大小。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验设置下，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进的性能，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ方法改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样为码本大小调整提供了所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个专门针对渲染视频的无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集，解决了现有方法在渲染视频上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集主要针对相机拍摄的视频，而渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影，直接应用现有方法会导致有偏预测。

Method: 构建了一个大规模渲染视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 与现有NR-VQA指标相比，该方法在渲染视频上表现出更优越的性能，并能有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 提出的渲染专用NR-VQA方法和数据集为渲染视频质量评估提供了有效工具，在计算机图形应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型（如MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP），最简单的基础提示词效果最好，而增加描述性细节反而会显著降低性能，这种现象被称为'提示词过拟合'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型能够在数据稀缺条件下进行零样本分类，但提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估了OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM模型，采用三级提示词设计，系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型在简单提示词下表现最佳（MetaCLIP 2多类准确率68.8%），而增加细节后准确率降至55.1%。低性能模型SigLip在模糊类别上使用基于身体线索的描述性提示词时表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有重要影响，高性能模型容易发生提示词过拟合，而低性能模型可能从更详细的提示词中受益。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们继承了VLMs有限的空间推理能力，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位，导致训练效率低下且空间理解仍不准确

Method: 采用混合transformer设计，统一整合视觉语言模型、深度transformer和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力机制形成端到端模型，显式融入空间感知能力

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5% vs 65.0%的进展，LIBERO模拟器中94.9% vs 93.6%，Simpler模拟器中74.8% vs 58.8%，均显著优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过简单有效的深度预测模块成功增强了VLA模型的空间推理能力，在多个环境中都表现出色，代码将公开提供

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLSDA框架利用预训练大模型的语义先验知识，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督方案，显著提升了WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，在跨域场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法在泛化能力和语义表达方面的局限性，由于CSI数据的领域敏感性以及缺乏高层手势抽象，导致现有方法难以适应真实AIoT环境中的变化。

Method: 提出GLSDA框架，包括：1）双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式；2）多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入；3）语义感知软监督方案增强类别区分；4）鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务上均优于现有最先进方法，同时显著减小模型尺寸和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案，有效解决了WiFi手势识别的泛化挑战。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估空间推理能力方面不足，尤其是对人类空间认知中至关重要的内在动态空间推理。

Method: 基于认知分类法构建统一基准，开发可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样化且可验证的空间推理问题。

Result: 对28个最先进VLM的评估显示，当前模型在人类能力方面存在明显差距，特别是在多步骤多视角空间推理任务上。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用移除KL约束、应用约简策略和过滤低质量样本等策略增强方法。

Result: 在基础模型Show-o上应用Mask-GRPO后，在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面取得了显著改进，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该领域提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够在4K+分辨率下保持内容一致性和提示对齐，解决现有方法在分辨率提升时的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法受限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐的挑战加剧，需要一种能够处理4K+分辨率的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器在降低分辨率下学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中的常见伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距，为4K+分辨率图像修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决异构场景下协同感知中的特征差异问题，通过轻量级空间通道调整器和域分离分布对齐模块实现高效特征对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但实际部署中存在异构性，现有方法对域差异噪声敏感且推理效率低

Method: CoDS包含LSCR（轻量级空间通道调整器）和DADS（域分离分布对齐）两个特征对齐模块，使用DAMI损失函数最大化异构特征间的互信息

Result: 实验证明CoDS能有效缓解异构场景下的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡

Conclusion: CoDS通过完全卷积架构和域分离策略，为实际异构场景下的协同感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素层面操作，难以分离神经元对物理场景属性的选择性。需要开发能够直接在3D空间中研究神经元选择性的方法。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，通过径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和缩放，同时保持几何规律性。

Result: 该方法成功应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学相结合，提供了超越传统像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的新途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功实现了文本到3D的高质量生成，通过模型缝合和奖励微调技术有效结合了不同预训练模型的优势。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: 模型具有高度适应性，可用于开发实际场景中的端到端情绪识别系统，代码和结果已公开。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: UniME-V2通过MLLM增强的语义理解能力有效解决了多模态嵌入中的负样本挖掘和语义区分问题，显著提升了模型的判别性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 动作单元作为非瞬态特征能有效缓解增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在复杂情感识别任务上表现出色，且模型具有轻量化的优势。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经参数化3D乳房形状模型的低成本单目RGB视频3D表面重建方法，通过局部隐式神经表示显著提升了重建质量，误差小于2毫米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有商业3D乳房扫描方案成本高昂且需要专用硬件的问题，开发一种仅需普通RGB视频即可实现高质量3D乳房几何重建的开放源码方法。

Method: 结合现成的运动恢复结构(SfM)流程和提出的局部隐式乳房形状模型(liRBSM)，该模型将隐式乳房域分解为多个基于解剖标志点的局部神经SDF区域。

Result: 重建质量显著优于全局模型iRBSM，误差小于2毫米，处理时间少于6分钟，实现了高细节的表面重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、高质量的3D乳房几何重建提供了可行的解决方案，具有完全透明和开源的优势。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

### [66] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM特征检测中的性能，发现GPU在传统特征检测器上表现更好，而FPGA在学习型检测器SuperPoint上具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中的耗时模块，需要针对功耗受限平台（如无人机）进行硬件加速优化。GPU和FPGA是两种常见的加速方案，但缺乏系统性的对比研究。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC平台上，对比GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在V-SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统检测器（FAST、Harris）的GPU实现性能更好；学习型检测器SuperPoint的FPGA实现性能更优（速度提升3.1倍，能效提升1.4倍）。GPU加速的V-SLAM精度更高。

Conclusion: 硬件加速可提升V-SLAM性能，GPU适合传统特征检测，FPGA更适合学习型检测器，两者在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于代理的流式基准测试，用于研究跨文化组成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化的情况。

Method: 使用基于CLIP特征空间的代理模型，在5x5格子上进行移动和交互，环境提供按sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。比较了单文化群体（西方/亚洲）和混合群体的表现。

Result: 亚洲群体在低模糊度时表现更好但中段下降更快，西方群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化但不平衡设置会放大多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中的深度估计需要鲁棒性，雷达-相机融合能在恶劣条件下提供互补的几何线索，但现有方法参数过多，需要轻量化设计。

Method: 提出轻量级架构XD-RCDepth，引入两种知识蒸馏策略：可解释性对齐蒸馏（传递教师网络的显著性结构）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重构为离散分箱的软分类）。

Result: 相比直接训练，MAE降低7.97%，在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现实时高效性，参数减少29.7%的同时保持可比精度。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth通过知识蒸馏策略成功实现了轻量化深度估计，在保持精度的同时显著减少参数，为自动驾驶提供了高效的雷达-相机融合解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Conclusion: PCDF方法能够有效应对多样化成像条件挑战，提升无人机全天候目标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVAR-Net，一种轻量级高效的音频-视觉异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视觉模态来解决现有方法在遮挡、低光照等挑战性条件下的不可靠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等挑战性条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络（MTCN），用于建模跨模态关系和长程时序依赖。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集可作为推进多模态异常识别研究的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Conclusion: 本综述揭示了当前医学图像增强领域的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，强调了需要更多关注专业成像模态和混合方法的开发。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测机制和校准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力尚未得到充分研究，这对于安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 基于AnomalyDINO框架，在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头进行白盒梯度攻击；使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后验校准。

Result: FGSM攻击导致性能指标显著下降；校准后的后验概率在对抗样本上具有更高的预测熵，可用于攻击检测并降低校准误差。

Conclusion: DINOv2异常检测器存在具体脆弱性，对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是构建可信异常检测系统的必备能力。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试中表现出色，能够生成结构一致、细节真实的高质量图像，有效减少伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文感知和条件机制，成功解决了现有方法在处理退化图像时的问题，实现了高保真度的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑流程中提供了一个可扩展的通用范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法难以跨域泛化，主要由于标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像数据集，采用伪标签策略，设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和语义线索计算置信度，选择高质量伪标签进行损失计算。

Conclusion: OmniGaze作为一个可扩展的数据引擎，能够有效利用无标签数据提升3D视线估计的泛化性能。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码自回归模型在视频生成中存在两个主要问题：慢启动问题（早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验）和空间时间维度上的误差累积问题。

Method: 提出CanvasMAR模型，引入画布机制（模糊的全局下一帧预测）作为掩码生成的起点；采用组合式无分类器引导联合放大空间和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上表现优异，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了掩码自回归模型的局限性，为视频生成提供了更高效、更连贯的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了KnowCoL框架，通过结合图像、文本和结构化知识来提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，在未见实体上比现有最佳方法提升10.5%准确率，且模型小35倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临有限监督、高视觉歧义和语义消歧等挑战，需要处理长尾分布和未见实体的识别问题。

Method: 基于知识引导的对比学习框架，将图像和文本描述映射到共享语义空间，利用Wikidata的结构化信息（实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文）进行零样本实体识别。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，视觉、文本和结构化知识的结合显著提高了准确率，特别是对罕见和未见实体的识别效果更好。最小模型在未见实体上的准确率比现有最佳方法高10.5%，且模型规模小35倍。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态信息和结构化知识，可以有效解决开放域视觉实体识别的挑战，特别是在处理长尾分布和零样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个生成模型，能够从单张图像或文本提示在几秒内生成3D场景，速度比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，但3D导向方法虽然保证3D一致性，但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在整合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：1）利用视频扩散模型先验预训练双模式多视图扩散模型；2）通过跨模式后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式分布匹配到高质量MV导向模式；3）利用大规模单视图图像和文本提示增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，并减少推理所需的去噪步骤，实现了高效高质量的3D场景生成。

Conclusion: FlashWorld成功整合了MV导向和3D导向方法的优势，在速度和质量上都超越了现有方法，为快速3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

### [80] [Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684)
*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康反事实图像，在保留患者个体解剖特征的同时有效去除病理区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成健康反事实图像在医学影像中具有重要应用价值，如异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用。现有方法难以平衡病理去除与个体特征保留的问题。

Method: 采用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM方法能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构的健康反事实图像，为医学影像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

### [81] [Risk-adaptive Activation Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13698)
*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为风险自适应激活引导（RAS）的方法，通过重新表述查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，从而实现准确的风险评估，并自适应地引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应，而无需迭代输出调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在面对恶意多模态查询时存在安全漏洞，传统方法如训练时安全对齐成本高昂，而推理时对齐方法则存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: RAS方法通过重新表述查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行准确的风险评估，并基于评估结果自适应地引导激活生成响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保证安全性的同时提升了推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

*Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Sooyeon Go,Jin-Hwa Kim,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVCustom是一个新型扩散框架，旨在同时实现多视角一致性和定制化保真度，解决现有模型在多视角生成和定制化任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角生成模型不支持几何一致性的定制化，而定制化模型缺乏明确的视角控制，难以统一。

Method: MVCustom采用基于特征场的表示学习主体身份和几何结构，结合文本到视频扩散骨干网络，通过密集时空注意力利用时间一致性实现多视角一致性。推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: 大量实验表明MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制化的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多视角定制化任务中的关键挑战，为可控生成模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

*Fabio Musio,Norman Juchler,Kaiyuan Yang,Suprosanna Shit,Chinmay Prabhakar,Bjoern Menze,Sven Hirsch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的骨架化方法，结合图连接算法，从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环（CoW）的中心线表示和形态特征，用于脑血管病理分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是大脑中关键的动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。传统的骨架化技术难以从CoW的复杂几何结构中提取可靠的中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集（包含200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像）中提取中心线图。开发基线算法，结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接，评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 基线算法能够高精度重建图拓扑结构（F1=1），预测图与参考图之间的平均欧几里得节点距离小于一个体素。半径、长度和分叉比等特征显示出强鲁棒性，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能够实现解剖学上合理的中心线提取。强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性的重要性。数据集和基线算法已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集仅限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真值，无法满足多相机光场配准的评估需求。

Method: 提供两种互补的配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计6-DoF外参的plenoptic PnP算法，均显式集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真值强对齐，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集为多相机光场配准提供了基准评估平台，提出的配准方法能够实现准确且可扩展的多相机配准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架（CSS-Diff），用于从低场MRI合成高质量的高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束和两个新网络模块来保持解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI成本低、可及性高但分辨率差，合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度和增强细粒度结构细节。

Method: CSS-Diff框架基于循环一致性约束的扩散模型，包含切片间隙感知网络（通过对比学习对齐切片不一致性）和局部结构校正网络（通过掩码和扰动块的自重建增强局部特征恢复）。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689），细粒度解剖结构保真度显著提升（如左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成定量可靠且解剖一致的高质量图像，有效解决了低场到高场MRI合成的保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图构建方法LSGC和混合CNN-GNN模型LogViG，通过限制长距离连接数量来提升视觉图神经网络性能，在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图构建方法（如KNN）在大型图像上计算成本高，而SVGA等方法存在固定步长尺度导致过度压缩和丢失多连接的问题，需要更有效的长距离连接处理方式。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建（LSGC）方法，并构建LogViG混合模型，结合高分辨率分支和低分辨率分支进行多尺度特征融合。

Result: 最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%的平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN提高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法利用长距离连接可以显著提升视觉图神经网络的性能，超越当前最先进的ViG模型。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在复制中文书法时存在局限：要么只能生成高质量的单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。

Method: 采用统一的扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务。使用不对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优异的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强。框架成功扩展到其他古文字，包括甲骨文和埃及象形文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过识别和生成的协同作用，促进了概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下改善了两种任务，为书法计算复制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Motivation: 为了解决轻量级模型在全模态理解和语音生成方面的不足，开发一个统一的多模态交互模型。

Method: 集成视觉编码器、音频编码器、大语言模型和语音解码器，采用多阶段训练策略，包括预训练和后训练，并精心构建多轮训练数据集。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

*Junhong Shen,Mu Cai,Bo Hu,Ameet Talwalkar,David A Ross,Cordelia Schmid,Alireza Fathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的视觉推理框架，通过将视觉内容转换为可执行代码来解决多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉推理中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理图表、图解等结构化视觉内容时存在精确推理困难，因为基于像素的感知缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA、Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码进行辅助线绘制或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知建立在可执行代码基础上，为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Uni-MMMU是一个综合性多模态基准测试，旨在评估理解与生成能力的双向协同，涵盖8个推理领域，强调两种能力的耦合任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估视觉理解和生成能力，或忽视两者内在耦合的任务，无法真正检验统一多模态模型的整合能力。

Method: 设计了包含可验证中间推理步骤、唯一真值和可复现评分协议的基准测试，每个任务都要求模型进行理解引导生成或生成辅助推理的双向耦合。

Result: 通过对先进统一模型、纯生成模型和纯理解模型的广泛评估，发现了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: 揭示了理解与生成能力相互强化的条件和机制，为推进统一模型发展提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D fMRI数据转换为2D活动平面图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时数据上训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小呈严格幂律缩放规律增长，下游分类显示模型学习到丰富表征，支持跨被试的细粒度状态解码和跨脑状态变化的个体特异性特征解码。

Conclusion: 成功构建了fMRI基础模型，验证了大规模预训练在fMRI数据分析中的有效性，为开放科学项目提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVC是一个基于扩散模型的故事情节延续框架，通过自适应视觉条件机制，在生成连贯叙事图像时有效利用先前的视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事情节延续中如何有效利用先前的视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐的挑战。当先前的视觉信息与当前输入冲突时，避免引入误导性或无关信息。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP模型检索先前帧中最语义对齐的图像；2. 当没有足够相关图像时，自适应地限制先前视觉影响仅作用于扩散过程的早期阶段；3. 使用大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集以提升数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人类评估表明，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在先验视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性案例中表现优异。

Conclusion: AVC框架通过自适应视觉条件机制，能够有效利用有益的视觉上下文，同时避免无关信息的干扰，在故事情节延续任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者身份证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要访问模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展

Method: 利用扩散过程初始噪声与生成视觉内容的高度相关性，通过哈希函数将随机种子嵌入到噪声采样过程中，确保无法从内容中恢复有效种子，并使用密码学零知识证明来证明所有权

Result: 在多个先进的图像和视频扩散模型上验证了NoisePrints的有效性，展示了仅使用种子和输出即可进行高效验证，无需模型权重

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护方案，通过保持种子秘密增加了水印移除的难度，为扩散模型的内容认证提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 本文提出Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清洗管道，通过高质量数据训练出性能优异的完全开源多模态大语言模型Bee-8B，在多个基准测试中达到或超越半开源模型水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型在性能上落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距。现有开源数据集普遍存在噪声和复杂推理数据（如思维链）不足的问题。

Method: 1）构建包含1500万问答对的Honey-Data-15M数据集，采用多重清洗技术和双级思维链增强策略；2）开发HoneyPipe数据清洗管道和DataStudio框架；3）基于该数据集训练8B参数的Bee-8B模型。

Result: Bee-8B在完全开源多模态大语言模型中建立了新的SOTA，性能与半开源模型如InternVL3.5-8B相当甚至在某些方面超越。

Conclusion: 通过系统性的数据质量优化，完全开源的多模态大语言模型能够达到与半开源模型竞争的水平，为社区提供了高质量的数据集、工具链和模型权重。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，首次实现了无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并创建了GCoT数据集来连接定位与空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示。开发GS-Reasoner模型实现无需外部模块的自回归定位。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得优异结果，显著提升了空间推理能力，达到最先进性能水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过GCoT数据集成功连接了定位与推理任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于像素作为视频动态基本单元的原则，需要更有效的时空表示方法来建模和理解视频动态

Method: 使用轨迹场表示视频，通过神经网络预测每个像素的B样条控制点参数化轨迹，实现在任意时间点的3D位置查询

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到SOTA性能，在点跟踪基准上表现竞争力，效率显著提升，并展现出目标条件操作、运动预测等新兴能力

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示法为视频动态建模提供了有效框架，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播实现了高效准确的轨迹预测

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉验证任务上表现不佳，与人类水平存在显著差距，需要开发能够进行可靠视觉验证和优化的下一代推理系统。

Method: 1) 构建ViVerBench基准评估多模态推理中的视觉结果；2) 设计自动化管道构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器；3) 提出OmniVerifier-TTS序列测试时扩展范式，通过迭代优化提升生成能力。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分；OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7分和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推动了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展的测试时优化，为更可信和可控的下一代推理系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在新领域面临性能急剧下降问题，现有领域自适应方法存在领域特定特征学习有限或灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出VisCoP方法，在VLM视觉编码器中添加一组紧凑的可学习视觉探针，实现高效领域自适应，最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标域获得优异性能并有效保留源域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP为解决VLM在新领域的适应问题提供了有效方案，通过轻量级修改实现高效领域自适应。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster是一个通过物理表示学习来增强视频生成模型物理意识的框架，它使用强化学习和人类反馈来优化物理表示，从而提高生成视频的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。需要一种方法来增强视频生成模型的物理意识。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件。应用强化学习与人类反馈，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）端到端优化物理表示。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并展示了对广泛物理场景的泛化性。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表示学习统一了各种物理过程的解决方案，可以作为物理感知视频生成和更广泛应用的通用即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

TL;DR: Dedelayed是一种延迟校正方法，通过结合本地轻量模型和远程重量模型的特征处理，解决远程推理中的延迟问题，实现实时低延迟输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程推理虽然能让轻量设备利用强大的云端模型，但网络延迟会导致预测结果过时，无法满足实时任务需求。

Method: 使用轻量级本地模型处理当前帧，同时融合远程重量模型从过去帧计算的特征，以校正任意远程推理延迟。

Result: 在BDD100K驾驶数据集上，Dedelayed在33ms以上所有现实网络延迟下，语义分割准确率均优于本地和远程基线方法。在100ms往返延迟下，相比全本地推理提升6.4 mIoU，相比远程推理提升9.8 mIoU。

Conclusion: 该方法在较长延迟和高运动场景下优势更明显，能够有效维持准确率，为需要与当前世界状态保持一致的实时任务提供明显优势。

Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud
models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and
unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a
delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,
allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our
method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and
fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On
video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic
segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only
baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.
Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared
to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a
round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and
higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more
effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain
aligned with the current world state.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可引导条件扩散方法，结合似然调度扩散框架，通过低秩适应技术来解决PET图像重建中的领域偏移问题，有效抑制幻觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在PET图像重建中表现出色，但面临领域偏移问题——在不同解剖结构、采集协议或病理条件下的数据上可能产生伪影，这限制了临床应用的推广。

Method: 将可引导条件扩散与PET-LiSch框架结合，在重建时对每个扩散步骤使用低秩适应技术，实时调整扩散模型先验以适应目标域。

Result: 在2D脑部体模实验中，该方法在领域偏移情况下能有效抑制幻觉伪影，在定性和定量评估上均优于OSEM和基础扩散模型。

Conclusion: 可引导先验能够缓解基于扩散的PET重建中的领域偏移问题，为未来在真实数据上的评估提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of
positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training
data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors
trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may
produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable
conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled
diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion
model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion
step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with
the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain
phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under
domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and
tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,
outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and
quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors
can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate
future evaluation on real data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数学方法，仅利用飞行时间PET发射数据同时重建活动分布和衰减sinogram，解决了传统PET成像中衰减校正依赖额外扫描的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PET成像需要依赖CT或MRI进行衰减校正，这会带来额外辐射剂量、延长扫描时间，并可能因运动导致图像错位。现有方法存在衰减校正因子误差和扫描效率低下的问题。

Method: 基于最大似然估计，开发了新的数学模型，充分利用衰减校正因子的指数形式，并考虑活动总量约束。提出了交替更新算法并分析了其收敛性。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法具有数值收敛性、对噪声鲁棒，在准确性和效率上优于现有先进方法，能够实现自主衰减校正。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了从TOF-PET发射数据中同时重建活动和衰减信息的可行性，为解决PET成像中的衰减校正问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform
attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity
map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on
the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction
factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses
and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment
induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To
address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new
mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and
attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.
Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the
attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount
of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we
prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of
the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model,
and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various
TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical
convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods
in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous
attenuation correction.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration

TL;DR: UNCAP提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息实现CAV间通信，同时明确考虑感知不确定性，显著提升了通信效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CAV协调方法中要么依赖高带宽原始传感器数据传输，要么忽略共享数据中感知和规划不确定性的问题，这些方法既不具可扩展性也不安全。

Method: 采用两阶段通信协议：首先识别最相关的车辆子集进行信息交换，然后选定的CAV传输定量表达其感知不确定性的自然语言消息，通过选择性融合最大化互信息的消息来整合最相关信号。

Result: 实验显示通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，近碰撞事件中碰撞距离裕度增加四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP方法通过不确定性引导的自然语言通信，显著提升了多CAV协同规划的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

TL;DR: 对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型进行系统性脆弱性分析，发现尽管在基准测试中表现优异，但这些模型在七个维度的扰动下表现出严重的脆弱性，性能从95%降至30%以下，且模型倾向于完全忽略语言指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLA模型在基准测试高分背后存在的根本性脆弱问题，挑战高分等于真正能力的假设，强调需要评估模型在现实变化下的可靠性。

Method: 通过在七个维度（物体布局、相机视角、机器人初始状态、语言指令、光照条件、背景纹理和传感器噪声）引入受控扰动，对多个最先进模型进行系统性脆弱性分析。

Result: 模型对扰动因素表现出极端敏感性，特别是相机视角和机器人初始状态；令人惊讶的是，模型对语言变化不敏感，进一步实验显示模型倾向于完全忽略语言指令。

Conclusion: 高基准分数并不等同于真正的能力，需要建立能够评估模型在现实变化下可靠性的评估实践。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

TL;DR: VLURes是一个新的多语言视觉语言理解基准测试，涵盖英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言，包含8个视觉语言任务和一个无关性任务，用于评估VLMs在长文本设置下的细粒度能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs评估主要局限于英语为中心的基准测试，且图像-文本对多为短文本，缺乏对多语言环境和长文本设置的细粒度能力评估。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中收集数据集，涵盖10个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文，通过自动评估和母语者评估VLMs生成响应和推理的能力。

Result: 评估了10个VLMs，最佳模型GPT-4o总体准确率为90.8%，但仍比人类表现低6.7%，开源模型的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes在开发智能代理处理多模态视觉推理方面具有关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务之间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

Result: 在多模态生成和理解基准测试中表现有竞争力，在多轮多模态交互和跨模态检索方面优于之前的统一模型。

Conclusion: NExT-OMNI作为下一代多模态基础模型具有架构优势，通过简洁的统一表示而非任务解耦设计，能够支持更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

Motivation: 探索符号接地在大规模训练的语言模型中如何自发产生，以及这种现象的具体机制和位置，目前相关研究还很少。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制分析和因果分析系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的产生过程，比较了Transformer、状态空间模型和单向LSTM等不同架构。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可以在语言模型中自发涌现，这对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Motivation: 在拥有数千万月活跃用户的大型电商平台上，推荐视觉相似商品对于帮助用户高效发现符合偏好的商品至关重要。

Method: 使用Mercari三个月内收集的100万商品图像-标题对微调SigLIP模型，开发用于推荐系统的图像编码器生成商品嵌入向量。

Conclusion: 基于VLM的编码器在电商商品推荐中具有显著效果，为开发基于视觉相似性的推荐系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly
users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users
to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study
presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has
demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval
tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer
marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically,
we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using
one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month
period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in
the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of
historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.
In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared
with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by
50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing
model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for
e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the
development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.

Motivation: 解决当前地理空间预测方法中任务特定模型和基础模型多模态融合能力不足的问题，实现对住房价格、公共卫生指标等城市现象的有效预测。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器处理街景图像、遥感数据、地图和POI数据，通过基于Transformer的融合模块学习统一表示，支持训练和推理过程中灵活使用任意可用模态子集。

Conclusion: UrbanFusion提供了一个灵活且强大的地理基础模型框架，能够适应不同数据可用性场景，为城市现象预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at
