Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for
automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in
extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies
and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated
Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch
design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial
features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics, with continuous fusion
via a gating mechanism. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000,
RLVS, and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict
separation between training and testing sets. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark offering an optimal balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of
SSMs for scalable, real-time surveillance violence detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统农业物联网系统依赖专家知识，难以处理多模态数据和动态环境，实时决策能力有限。LLMs的知识获取和语义理解能力为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出Farm-LightSeek框架，通过边缘节点收集多源数据（图像、天气、地理信息），进行跨模态推理和疾病检测，实现低延迟决策和云端协作。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，Farm-LightSeek在边缘计算资源限制下仍能可靠完成任务。

Conclusion: Farm-LightSeek推动了实时智能农业解决方案的发展，展示了农业物联网与LLMs深度融合的潜力。

Abstract: Amid the challenges posed by global population growth and climate change,
traditional agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) systems is currently
undergoing a significant digital transformation to facilitate efficient big
data processing. While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant
challenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge,
difficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic
environments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large
language models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge
acquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address
these challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric
multimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with
edge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data
(images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal
reasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management
decisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main
innovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural
"perception-decision-action" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive
monitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance
and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate
that Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in
mission-critical tasks, even under the limitations of edge computing resources.
This work advances intelligent real-time agricultural solutions and highlights
the potential for deeper integration of agricultural IoT with LLMs.

### [3] [Improvement of human health lifespan with hybrid group pose estimation methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03169)
*Arindam Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合集成的群体姿态估计方法，旨在通过结合改进的群体姿态估计和实时姿态估计技术，提升多人姿态检测的准确性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类姿态估计在健康监测等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法在遮挡和密集回归准确性上存在不足。

Method: 结合改进的群体姿态估计和实时姿态估计技术，通过姿态变换方法提取特征，并在公开数据集上训练混合集成模型。

Result: 该方法在实时姿态估计中表现优异，提升了遮挡鲁棒性和密集回归准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时应用中具有潜力，可改善人类健康监测效果。

Abstract: Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their
body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision
advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This
comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These
para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible
to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses
content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation
software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we
develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human
health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims
to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified
real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated
methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual
meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features
for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized
pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is
being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of
proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose
estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It
provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose
estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression
accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in
several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span

### [4] [PALADIN : Robust Neural Fingerprinting for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03170)
*Murthy L,Subarna Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于循环纠错码的神经指纹方法，用于文本到图像扩散模型，以实现完美准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源文本到图像生成模型可能被恶意使用，现有神经指纹方法无法达到100%准确性，导致实际不可部署。

Method: 利用编码理论中的循环纠错码概念，为扩散模型设计神经指纹。

Result: 实现了完美的归属准确性（100%）。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有神经指纹技术的准确性不足问题，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses,
especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a
serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models
with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a
plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A
trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such
models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved
$100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect}
accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate
method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models
leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of
coding theory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeVidSum是一种轻量级方法，直接在边缘设备上生成长视频的个性化快进摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视频摘要方法计算复杂度高、无法在资源受限设备上实时处理的问题，同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 使用基于缩略图的容器技术减少计算复杂度，结合轻量级2D CNN模型分析用户偏好内容并生成时间戳。

Result: 能够在Jetson Nano等资源受限设备上实时生成个性化视频摘要。

Conclusion: EdgeVidSum在计算效率、个性化和隐私保护方面为现代视频消费环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: EdgeVidSum is a lightweight method that generates personalized, fast-forward
summaries of long-form videos directly on edge devices. The proposed approach
enables real-time video summarization while safeguarding user privacy through
local data processing using innovative thumbnail-based techniques and efficient
neural architectures. Unlike conventional methods that process entire videos
frame by frame, the proposed method uses thumbnail containers to significantly
reduce computational complexity without sacrificing semantic relevance. The
framework employs a hierarchical analysis approach, where a lightweight 2D CNN
model identifies user-preferred content from thumbnails and generates
timestamps to create fast-forward summaries. Our interactive demo highlights
the system's ability to create tailored video summaries for long-form videos,
such as movies, sports events, and TV shows, based on individual user
preferences. The entire computation occurs seamlessly on resource-constrained
devices like Jetson Nano, demonstrating how EdgeVidSum addresses the critical
challenges of computational efficiency, personalization, and privacy in modern
video consumption environments.

### [6] [FOLIAGE: Towards Physical Intelligence World Models Via Unbounded Surface Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03173)
*Xiaoyi Liu,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLIAGE是一个物理信息的多模态世界模型，用于无界增长表面的预测和控制，通过多模态编码和物理感知预测实现物理智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够从部分多感官观察中预测和塑造世界的物理智能模型，以提升下一代世界模型的性能。

Method: 使用统一的上下文编码器将图像、网格连接和点云映射到共享潜在状态，结合物理感知预测器和多模态生长嵌入（MAGE）进行时间推进。

Result: FOLIAGE在多种任务和压力测试中优于专用基线模型，表现出对动态环境的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOLIAGE为物理智能提供了一种新的多模态世界模型路径，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial,
multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We
propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded
accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context
encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent
state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions,
advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the
surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces
with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network
(AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and
Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch
Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances
global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model
learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal
Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse
surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation
suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material
estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal
retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout,
zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation --
to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining
robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based,
multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

### [7] [Multimodal Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Retrieval and Activity Recognition Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03174)
*Koki Matsuishi,Kosuke Ukita,Tsuyoshi Okita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AURA-MFM的多模态基础模型，整合了第三人称视频、动作捕捉、IMU和文本四种模态，显著提升了人类活动分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型主要依赖第一人称视频和文本数据，无法全面分析全身活动，因此需要整合更多模态以实现更详细的分析。

Method: 通过整合第三人称视频、动作捕捉、IMU和文本数据，并采用基于Transformer的IMU编码器，构建了AURA-MFM模型。

Result: 在检索和活动识别任务中表现优异，零样本分类的F1分数为0.6226，准确率为0.7320，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AURA-MFM通过多模态整合和Transformer编码器，实现了对人类活动的更全面理解，为行为分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted
the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span
diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have
increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis.
Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate
first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in
providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this
limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment -
Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four
modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating
third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and
multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person
perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU
encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental
evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our
model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for
action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with
an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method
recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

### [8] [Vid-SME: Membership Inference Attacks against Large Video Understanding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03179)
*Qi Li,Runpeng Yu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-SME是一种针对视频理解大语言模型（VULLMs）的成员推断方法，通过计算Sharma-Mittal熵（SME）差异来检测训练数据中的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频理解中的应用引发了数据隐私问题，现有方法无法有效扩展到视频领域。

Method: 提出Vid-SME，利用模型输出置信度和自适应参数化计算SME，通过自然与时间反转视频帧的SME差异生成成员分数。

Result: 实验表明Vid-SME在多种VULLMs中表现优异。

Conclusion: Vid-SME是首个针对视频数据的成员推断方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video
understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious
data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive
video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their
training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a
critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership
inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods
fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from
poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible
true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to
their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and
to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To
address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference
method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs).
Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive
parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By
leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video
frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given
video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained
and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraIncognita是一个动态基准，用于评估多模态模型在识别未知昆虫物种方面的能力，结合了已知和稀有物种的图像数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球生物多样性快速丧失，尤其是昆虫，当前物种发现方法效率低下，亟需技术改进以支持保护行动。

Method: 通过混合已知和稀有昆虫物种的图像数据，评估模型在分类、检测新物种和生成解释方面的能力。

Result: 模型在粗分类（如目级）表现优异（F1>90%），但在细分类（如种级）表现极差（F1<2%）。

Conclusion: TerraIncognita为AI方法提供了一个持续更新的基准平台，推动昆虫物种发现技术的发展。

Abstract: The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents
an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are
manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely
conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed
to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of
identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data.
Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect
species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known
species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were
collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking
open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses
models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability
to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel
species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert
taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the
Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level,
highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic
prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$
Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to
quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an
evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All
TerraIncognita data, results, and future updates are available

Motivation: 探索DCNN中调参对分类性能的影响，以优化模型表现。

Method: 使用包含2个卷积层、2个池化层、1个dropout和1个密集层的DCNN，在裂缝图像数据集上测试不同参数组合。

Result: maxpooling、adam优化器和tanh激活函数组合表现最佳。

Conclusion: 调参对DCNN性能有显著影响，特定组合可提升模型表现。

Abstract: The performance of a classifier depends on the tuning of its parame ters. In
this paper, we have experimented the impact of various tuning parameters on the
performance of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). In the ex perimental
evaluation, we have considered a DCNN classifier that consists of 2
convolutional layers (CL), 2 pooling layers (PL), 1 dropout, and a dense layer.
To observe the impact of pooling, activation function, and optimizer tuning pa
rameters, we utilized a crack image dataset having two classes: negative and
pos itive. The experimental results demonstrate that with the maxpooling, the
DCNN demonstrates its better performance for adam optimizer and tanh activation
func tion.

*Ghada Sokar,Gintare Karolina Dziugaite,Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Pablo Samuel Castro,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型合并的持续学习方法，以平衡稳定性和可塑性，减少遗忘并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法偏向于近期任务，导致遗忘问题，需要一种新方法来平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Method: 通过合并新任务参数与先前学习参数，并采用对齐权重机制避免干扰。

Result: 在视觉语言模型上验证了方法的有效性，减少了遗忘，提高了任务顺序和相似性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 模型合并方法在持续学习中有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual learning is conventionally tackled through sequential fine-tuning,
a process that, while enabling adaptation, inherently favors plasticity over
the stability needed to retain prior knowledge. While existing approaches
attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a bias towards recent tasks
persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a
new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still
retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights,
we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones,
promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging
process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights
with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate
this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its
effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task
orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

### [12] [MINT: Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning at Test-time for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03190)
*Jiaming Yi,Ruirui Pan,Jishen Yang,Xiulong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MINT的新框架，通过记忆提示库动态调整视觉语言预训练模型，以提升其在测试时数据分布变化下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法未能充分利用模型内部知识，特别是在动态适应复杂和分层的视觉语义信息方面。

Method: MINT引入记忆提示库（MPB），存储可学习的键值提示对，通过分层视觉特征检索相关提示对，动态组装关联提示并注入图像编码器。

Result: MINT能够在无需源数据或重新训练的情况下，快速精确地适应视觉语言预训练模型。

Conclusion: MINT通过记忆提示库有效提升了模型在测试时的适应能力，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models
(VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge.
The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging
the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex
and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue.
Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt
Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory
of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the
MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to
dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then
injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual
guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid,
precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory,
without source data or retraining. The code is available at
https://github.com/Jamieyi2004/MINT.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth survey on the use of multimodal Generative
Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs)
for human motion understanding and generation, offering insights into emerging
methods, architectures, and their potential to advance realistic and versatile
motion synthesis. Focusing exclusively on text and motion modalities, this
research investigates how textual descriptions can guide the generation of
complex, human-like motion sequences. The paper explores various generative
approaches, including autoregressive models, diffusion models, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
transformer-based models, by analyzing their strengths and limitations in terms
of motion quality, computational efficiency, and adaptability. It highlights
recent advances in text-conditioned motion generation, where textual inputs are
used to control and refine motion outputs with greater precision. The
integration of LLMs further enhances these models by enabling semantic
alignment between instructions and motion, improving coherence and contextual
relevance. This systematic survey underscores the transformative potential of
text-to-motion GenAI and LLM architectures in applications such as healthcare,
humanoids, gaming, animation, and assistive technologies, while addressing
ongoing challenges in generating efficient and realistic human motion.

Method: 利用预训练的3D CNN提取时空特征，仅训练SVM分类器以减少时间成本，采用分层五折交叉验证。

Result: 在GMDCSA和CAUCAFall数据集上进行了实验，模型表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型和SVM分类器实现了高效的跌倒检测，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unintentional or accidental falls are one of the significant health issues in
senior persons. The population of senior persons is increasing steadily. So,
there is a need for an automated fall detection monitoring system. This paper
introduces a vision-based fall detection system using a pre-trained 3D CNN.
Unlike 2D CNN, 3D CNN extracts not only spatial but also temporal features. The
proposed model leverages the original learned weights of a 3D CNN model
pre-trained on the Sports1M dataset to extract the spatio-temporal features.
Only the SVM classifier was trained, which saves the time required to train the
3D CNN. Stratified shuffle five split cross-validation has been used to split
the dataset into training and testing data. Extracted features from the
proposed 3D CNN model were fed to an SVM classifier to classify the activity as
fall or ADL. Two datasets, GMDCSA and CAUCAFall, were utilized to conduct the
experiment. The source code for this work can be accessed via the following

reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains
surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess
visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring
two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot
patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of
nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance
deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The
best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a
striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants
achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model
reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap
in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores
potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this
perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster
further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

TL;DR: AutoSEP是一个自监督提示学习框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度图像分类任务中的性能，无需标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度图像分类需要关注细微视觉差异，而MLLMs可能忽略这些细节。AutoSEP通过自监督学习生成描述提示，引导MLLMs识别关键特征。

Method: AutoSEP利用未标注数据迭代优化描述提示，基于实例级分类评分函数，无需训练或微调MLLMs。

Result: 在多个细粒度分类数据集上，AutoSEP平均比零样本分类提升13%，优于其他无监督基线5%。

Conclusion: AutoSEP通过自监督提示学习显著提升了MLLMs在细粒度分类中的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on
general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification
remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to
distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may
easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce
AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to
enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised
manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description
prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within
an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic
self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve
the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level
classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to
MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our
approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently
outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average
improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over
the best-performing baselines. Code is available at:

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured,
machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as
traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited
adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end
reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly
layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly
released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic
scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we
instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called
Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and
formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity,
outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了FLEX数据集，首个多模态、多动作的大规模数据集，结合表面肌电信号（sEMG）用于动作质量评估（AQA），填补了现有AQA方法和数据集在健身领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健身训练中的潜在风险需要专业评估和指导，但现有AQA方法和数据集局限于单视角竞技体育场景和RGB模态，缺乏对健身动作的专业评估。

Method: FLEX数据集通过高精度MoCap收集38名不同技能水平的受试者执行20种负重动作的数据，包含RGB视频、3D姿态、sEMG和生理信息等多模态数据，并结合知识图谱构建标注规则。

Result: 实验表明，多模态数据、多视角数据和细粒度标注显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: FLEX推动了AQA方法和数据集向多模态、多动作场景发展，促进了人工智能在健身领域的应用。

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic
physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks
associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness
actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology
that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the
potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving
better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets
are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and
lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this
gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action,
large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals
into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different
weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels
for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D
pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates
knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty
functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and
feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating
that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations
significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA
methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but
also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness
domain. Dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶和扩展现实的快速发展，点云传输的高效性变得至关重要。

Method: 采用跨模态设计，融合图像和点云语义编码，结合通道自适应联合语义-信道编码架构，并利用修正的去噪扩散隐式模型加速解码。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在低信噪比、带宽限制等多样条件下具有鲁棒性，支持完全模拟传输，显著提升压缩效率。

Conclusion: GenSeC-PC通过生成先验和跨模态设计，实现了高效、鲁棒的点云传输，优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality,
efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important.
In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative
semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC.
GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where
images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is
built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures
high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction
performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and
reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric
channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the
encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available
bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is
employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling
real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages
generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or
incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission,
improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side
information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric
guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse
conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D
images, and previously unseen objects.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据且计算成本高，自监督学习虽能利用无标签数据，但存在计算成本高和特征对齐问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，ConMamba显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ConMamba为植物病害检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture.
However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated
datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised
Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of
unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high
computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based
architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies
in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align
local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates
the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model
(SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce
a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize
local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and
robust solution for PDD.

Conclusion: OpenCarbon能有效捕捉城市功能与碳排放的内在关系，支持高效碳治理和减排规划。

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for
effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional
methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data
collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques
offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is
developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on
available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open
data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict
high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing
macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively
dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon
emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit
effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial
contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model,
OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a
cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract
complementary functionality information from two modules and model their
interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the
spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's
superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further
generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to
capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon
emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and
targeted carbon mitigation planning. Codes and data are available:

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练模型的知识蒸馏提供了新思路，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample
is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy
annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these
models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve
"manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly
promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial
labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative
consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise
primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by
pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of
the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning
difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural
networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a
"Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization
constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our
method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further
enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and
disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model
application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning
techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

Motivation: DiT在推理时存在计算冗余，Chipmunk旨在通过动态稀疏化减少冗余，无需额外训练。

Method: 研究DiT激活变化，提出动态稀疏化方法Chipmunk，优化稀疏操作和缓存更新。

Result: Chipmunk在多个模型上实现1.41x-3.72x的加速，质量影响极小。

Conclusion: Chipmunk有效减少DiT推理冗余，显著提升效率，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at
inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly
across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant
across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this
redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change
between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%
of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations
across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic
sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate
activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems
challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU
tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and
caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,
Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce
column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient
sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at
93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk
overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other
parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra
latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on
FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that
Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup
on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev
with minimal quality impact.

Conclusion: 神经ODE方法为光流估计提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the
flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These
networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally
several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative
refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually
implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a
fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of
steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the
input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the
derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary
differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its
capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of
compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural
architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model
can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works,
offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical
flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive
improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a
single refinement step.

Motivation: 团队运动中的多目标跟踪因快速运动和频繁遮挡而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖检测和外观跟踪，难以应对复杂场景。

Method: 提出mamba-attention机制建模非线性运动，引入高度自适应空间关联度量减少遮挡导致的ID切换，并扩展检测搜索空间。

Result: 在SportsMOT数据集上表现优异，并在VIP-HTD冰球数据集上展示了零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: SportMamba在复杂运动场景中表现出色，具有通用性和适应性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to
the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and
identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios
is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion
patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and
appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports
scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not
necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce
SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking
in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold.
First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion
by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a
height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by
partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes.
Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to
improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique,
SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the
SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe
occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through
zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.

Conclusion: ArrowRL验证了时间方向性理解在LMMs中的重要性，并显著提升了模型的性能。

Abstract: The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is
fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for
modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and
utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries,
obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first
providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then
introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with
an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging
divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For
rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted
benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL
greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial
improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts
performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak
accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates
ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT
understanding in LMMs.

Abstract: Controlling defects in semiconductor processes is important for maintaining
yield, improving production cost, and preventing time-dependent critical
component failures. Electron beam-based imaging has been used as a tool to
survey wafers in the line and inspect for defects. However, manual
classification of images for these nano-scale defects is limited by time, labor
constraints, and human biases. In recent years, deep learning computer vision
algorithms have shown to be effective solutions for image-based inspection
applications in industry. This work proposes application of vision transformer
(ViT) neural networks for automatic defect classification (ADC) of scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of wafer defects. We evaluated our proposed
methods on 300mm wafer semiconductor defect data from our fab in IBM Albany. We
studied 11 defect types from over 7400 total images and investigated the
potential of transfer learning of DinoV2 and semi-supervised learning for
improved classification accuracy and efficient computation. We were able to
achieve classification accuracies of over 90% with less than 15 images per
defect class. Our work demonstrates the potential to apply the proposed
framework for a platform agnostic in-house classification tool with faster
turnaround time and flexibility.

TL;DR: KRONOS是一个为空间蛋白质组学设计的基础模型，通过自监督学习在多平台上训练，能够高效处理高维、多通道的成像数据，并在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间蛋白质组学在单细胞分辨率下映射蛋白质，但现有基础模型对其影响有限，因此需要专门设计的模型。

Method: KRONOS通过自监督学习在47百万图像块上训练，覆盖多种蛋白质标记和组织类型，并引入架构适应以处理多通道成像数据。

Result: KRONOS在11个独立队列中表现出色，支持细胞表型分析、区域分类和患者分层等任务，并实现高效数据处理。

Conclusion: KRONOS是一个灵活且可扩展的空间蛋白质组学工具，支持跨机构比较和图像反向搜索。

Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as
pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when
post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging
that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we
introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was
trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering
175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging
platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the
high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging.
We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations
across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue
levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell
phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated
across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance
across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks,
and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of
segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial
proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image
reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position
KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了城市声音与视觉场景的对应关系，通过多模态方法比较了不同视觉表示策略在捕捉声音语义上的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索环境声景在城市地理分析中的潜力，尤其是声音与视觉场景的关联。

Method: 结合地理参考声音记录与街景和遥感图像，使用AST、CLIP、RemoteCLIP等模型提取特征，评估跨模态相似性。

Result: 街景嵌入与声音对齐更强，而遥感分割在生态类别解释上更有效。

Conclusion: 嵌入模型提供更好的语义对齐，分割方法则更易解释视觉结构与声学生态的联系。

Abstract: Environmental soundscapes convey substantial ecological and social
information regarding urban environments; however, their potential remains
largely untapped in large-scale geographic analysis. In this study, we
investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by
comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic
semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound
recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major
global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio,
along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV
for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to
evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view
embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to
segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in
interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony
(BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer
superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide
interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work
advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel
perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.

*Shafqaat Ahmad*

TL;DR: EigenCL是一种无监督对比学习框架，用于早期作物胁迫检测，无需标记数据，通过生物特征分解和NDRE时间动态实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NDRE方法依赖标记数据且检测滞后，EigenCL旨在提供一种无需标记、可扩展的早期胁迫检测方法。

Method: 利用Sentinel-2 NDRE图像构建时间序列，通过RBF相似矩阵和特征分解提取主特征向量，指导对比学习嵌入。

Result: 在爱荷华州玉米田中，EigenCL实现76%的早期检测（提前12天），聚类和分类性能优异（Silhouette: 0.748，分类准确率95%）。

Conclusion: EigenCL是一种适用于数据稀缺环境的无监督方法，具有生理学意义和实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and
enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches
using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require
labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel
unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics
and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2
NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed
five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The
principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r
= 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for
contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual
augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar
stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings
formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering
metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection
up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification
yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an
independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without
retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress
detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for
real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.

TL;DR: ViT-Split是一种新的视觉基础模型适配方法，通过分离特征提取和任务适配，解决了现有方法中的梯度传播和参数调优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型适配器存在梯度传播过早和参数调优复杂的问题，且未能充分利用先验知识。

Method: 提出ViT-Split，将VFM分为特征提取器和任务适配器，引入任务头和先验头，减少训练时间和参数。

Result: 在多个任务上验证了ViT-Split的高效性，训练时间减少4倍，性能优于其他适配器。

Conclusion: ViT-Split通过分离设计和双头结构，显著提升了视觉基础模型的适配效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across a wide range of downstream tasks. While several VFM adapters have shown
promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two
inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between
convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer
gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all
components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features,
underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of
several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an
extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning
task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch
and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task
head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient
propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior
features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting.
Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth
estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of ViT-Split. Specifically, ViT-Split reduces training time up to
$4\times$ while achieving comparable or even better results on ADE20K, compared
to other VFM adapters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的人-物交互识别需要结合视觉和几何特征，但如何在不损害各自特性的情况下有效融合这些多模态特征仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出GeoVis-GNN，采用自底向上的方法，先建立实体特定表示，再通过双注意力特征融合和相互依赖的实体图学习建模交互。

Result: 在多种HOI场景（如双人交互、单人活动、双手操作等）中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GeoVis-GNN通过渐进式建模和多模态融合，显著提升了HOI识别的性能，并引入MPHOI-120数据集以支持复杂场景的研究。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition in videos requires understanding
both visual patterns and geometric relationships as they evolve over time.
Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features
capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural
patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising
their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing
robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps
preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a
bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this
insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network
(GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with
interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from
entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To
advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent
Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person
interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset
helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual
occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions,
single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent
partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RefEdit在复杂场景编辑任务中表现出色，同时提升了传统基准测试的性能，数据与模型已开源。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in inversion and instruction-based image editing,
existing approaches primarily excel at editing single, prominent objects but
significantly struggle when applied to complex scenes containing multiple
entities. To quantify this gap, we first introduce RefEdit-Bench, a rigorous
real-world benchmark rooted in RefCOCO, where even baselines trained on
millions of samples perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic
data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets,
outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data.
Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that our model not
only excels in referring expression tasks but also enhances performance on
traditional benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to
closed-source methods. We release data \& checkpoint for reproducibility.

Motivation: 解决真实图像数据稀缺、成本高及潜在安全风险的问题，提供一种廉价、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 通过UE4生成合成图像，测试其在两种分类任务（猫狗分类和焊接缺陷检测）中对VGG16和MobileNetV3-small模型性能的影响，并使用预训练模型评估合成图像质量。

Result: 合成图像可减少对真实图像的需求（仅需10%真实图像），且添加60%以上合成图像能将测试-训练准确率差距缩小至1-2%。

Conclusion: 合成图像为数据稀缺项目提供了一种高效、经济的解决方案，并提出了使用指南和潜在限制。

Abstract: This paper investigates how rendering engines, like Unreal Engine 4 (UE), can
be used to create synthetic images to supplement datasets for deep computer
vision (CV) models in image abundant and image limited use cases. Using
rendered synthetic images from UE can provide developers and businesses with a
method of accessing nearly unlimited, reproducible, agile, and cheap training
sets for their customers and applications without the threat of poisoned images
from the internet or the cost of collecting them. The validity of these
generated images are examined by testing the change in model test accuracy in
two different sized CV models across two binary classification cases (Cat vs
Dog and Weld Defect Detection). In addition, this paper provides an
implementation of how to measure the quality of synthetic images by using
pre-trained CV models as auditors. Results imply that for large (VGG16) and
small (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional
synthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the
test-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test
accuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10%
additional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the
classification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more
real training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from
rendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during
training, compared to the traditional 50-70%. This research serves as an
example of how to create synthetic images, guidelines on how to use the images,
potential restrictions and possible performance improvements for data-scarce
projects.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的鲁棒神经场方法（RoNFA），用于带有噪声标签的小样本图像分类，显著提升了模型在标签噪声下的鲁棒性和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在小样本学习中，标签样本稀缺且标签错误不可避免，这会显著降低分类准确性，因此提升模型在标签噪声下的鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: RoNFA通过两个神经场分别表示特征和类别，其中类别表示场（FCR）的神经元在特征表示场（FFR）上具有可调感受野（RF），并通过软聚类生成类别代表神经元。预测阶段通过自适应调整感受野范围来确保准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，RoNFA在三种不同标签噪声的真实小样本数据集上显著优于现有方法，甚至在噪声标签下的准确率超过了现有方法在干净支持集上的结果。

Conclusion: RoNFA具有卓越的小样本学习能力和对标签噪声的强鲁棒性，适用于现实场景中的小样本分类任务。

Abstract: In few-shot learning (FSL), the labeled samples are scarce. Thus, label
errors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are
inevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model
in the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust
neural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification
with noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category
representation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each
neuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field
(RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the
representative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the
prediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the
neuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning
strategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning
capability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results
on real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
FSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even
surpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean
support sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a challenging task in the domain
of multimedia retrieval. It is designed to identify and retrieve untrimmed
videos that are partially relevant to the provided query. In this work, we
investigate long-sequence video content understanding to address information
redundancy issues. Leveraging the outstanding long-term state space modeling
capability and linear scalability of the Mamba module, we introduce a
multi-Mamba module with temporal fusion framework (MamFusion) tailored for PRVR
task. This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term
video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance
understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we
introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model
temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving
contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on
large-scale datasets demonstrate that MamFusion achieves state-of-the-art

Result: 在NTU-60、NTU-120和PKU-MMD II数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同人形结构的机器人动作识别。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition has received widespread attention in
recent years due to its diverse range of application scenarios. Due to the
different sources of human skeletons, skeleton data naturally exhibit
heterogeneity. The previous works, however, overlook the heterogeneity of human
skeletons and solely construct models tailored for homogeneous skeletons. This
work addresses the challenge of heterogeneous skeleton-based action
representation learning, specifically focusing on processing skeleton data that
varies in joint dimensions and topological structures. The proposed framework
comprises two primary components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified
representation learning. The former first converts two-dimensional skeleton
data into three-dimensional skeleton via an auxiliary network, and then
constructs a prompted unified skeleton using skeleton-specific prompts. We also
design an additional modality named semantic motion encoding to harness the
semantic information within skeletons. The latter module learns a unified
action representation using a shared backbone network that processes different
heterogeneous skeletons. Extensive experiments on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and
PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various
tasks of action understanding. Our approach can be applied to action
recognition in robots with different humanoid structures.

Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream
generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision
tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion
models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in
multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different
entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional
hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series
diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive
integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving
in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In
addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional
denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the
training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on
publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves
state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization
capabilities in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: EDCFlow可作为RAFT类方法的即插即用模块，提升光流细节估计。

Abstract: Recent learning-based methods for event-based optical flow estimation utilize
cost volumes for pixel matching but suffer from redundant computations and
limited scalability to higher resolutions for flow refinement. In this work, we
take advantage of the complementarity between temporally dense feature
differences of adjacent event frames and cost volume and present a lightweight
event-based optical flow network (EDCFlow) to achieve high-quality flow
estimation at a higher resolution. Specifically, an attention-based multi-scale
temporal feature difference layer is developed to capture diverse motion
patterns at high resolution in a computation-efficient manner. An adaptive
fusion of high-resolution difference motion features and low-resolution
correlation motion features is performed to enhance motion representation and
model generalization. Notably, EDCFlow can serve as a plug-and-play refinement
module for RAFT-like event-based methods to enhance flow details. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDCFlow achieves better performance with lower
complexity compared to existing methods, offering superior generalization.

Motivation: 传统DPO方法因独立噪声生成的视频对导致偏好标注偏向低运动片段，且缺乏细粒度比较。

Method: DenseDPO通过去噪生成对齐视频对，利用时间对齐进行分段偏好标注，并探索自动标注方法。

Result: DenseDPO仅需1/3标注数据即可显著提升运动生成质量，同时保持文本对齐和视觉质量。

Conclusion: DenseDPO有效解决DPO的局限性，且自动标注方法接近人类标注效果。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a
post-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training
data, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated
from independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained
comparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion
clips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three
contributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted
copies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar
motion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing
the motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label
preferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and
more precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO
greatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text
alignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that
DenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision
Language Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences
similar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO
trained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.

Conclusion: 通过文本表示空间的语义中心搜索，提供了一种简单且鲁棒的通用域自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) focuses on transferring source domain
knowledge to the target domain under both domain shift and unknown category
shift. Its main challenge lies in identifying common class samples and aligning
them. Current methods typically obtain target domain semantics centers from an
unconstrained continuous image representation space. Due to domain shift and
the unknown number of clusters, these centers often result in complex and less
robust alignment algorithm. In this paper, based on vision-language models, we
search for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text
representation space. The constrained space ensures almost no domain bias and
appropriate semantic granularity for these centers, enabling a simple and
robust adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we propose TArget Semantics
Clustering (TASC) via Text Representations, which leverages information
maximization as a unified objective and involves two stages. First, with the
frozen encoders, a greedy search-based framework is used to search for an
optimal set of text embeddings to represent target semantics. Second, with the
search results fixed, encoders are refined based on gradient descent,
simultaneously achieving robust domain alignment and private class clustering.
Additionally, we propose Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS), a scoring
function tailored for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally, we
evaluate the universality of UniDA algorithms under four category shift
scenarios. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our method, which has achieved state-of-the-art
performance.

Method: 1. 构建基于技能的CoT标注；2. 引入技能特定的专家学习框架。

Result: 在三个视频理解基准测试中，Video-SKoT表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Video-SKoT通过技能感知的CoT监督和专家学习，显著提升了视频理解的领域适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex
video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to
domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding,
emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose
Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs
and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning.
First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant
reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill
taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each
video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert
learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning
skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT
supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three
video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms
strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT
annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Asymmetric Dual 3DGS的新框架，通过并行训练两个3D高斯模型并引入一致性约束，减少重建中的视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外图像3D重建中因光照条件和瞬态干扰导致的低质量训练数据问题。

Method: 使用两个3D高斯模型并行训练，结合一致性约束和互补掩码策略，避免模型陷入相似的错误模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法能稳定生成高质量3D重建结果，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to
inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods
typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data,
which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions,
frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric
Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these
artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor
randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages
convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent
artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes
due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that
applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a
self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the
two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency
of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy,
which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential
Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to
preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while
achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.

Result: 在五个数据集和三个多模态融合任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WIFE-Fusion通过频域交互实现了更精确的特征提取和融合。

Abstract: Multimodal image fusion effectively aggregates information from diverse
modalities, with fused images playing a crucial role in vision systems.
However, existing methods often neglect frequency-domain feature exploration
and interactive relationships. In this paper, we propose wavelet-aware
Intra-inter Frequency Enhancement Fusion (WIFE-Fusion), a multimodal image
fusion framework based on frequency-domain components interactions. Its core
innovations include: Intra-Frequency Self-Attention (IFSA) that leverages
inherent cross-modal correlations and complementarity through interactive
self-attention mechanisms to extract enriched frequency-domain features, and
Inter-Frequency Interaction (IFI) that enhances enriched features and filters
latent features via combinatorial interactions between heterogeneous
frequency-domain components across modalities. These processes achieve precise
source feature extraction and unified modeling of feature
extraction-aggregation. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three
multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate WIFE-Fusion's superiority over current
specialized and unified fusion methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: We propose DaigNet, a new approach to object detection with which we can
detect an object bounding box using diagonal constraints on adjacency matrix of
a graph convolutional network (GCN). We propose two diagonalization algorithms

Abstract: We present ViTSGMM, an image recognition network that leverages
semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often
rely on complex training techniques and architectures, while their
generalization ability when dealing with extremely limited labeled data remains
to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical

information between feature representations and target classes, compressing
redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on STL-10 and CIFAR-10/100 datasets when using negligible labeled

Conclusion: NWPU-Refer和MRSNet为遥感图像分割领域提供了重要资源和方法。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation is a complex and challenging task
that integrates the paradigms of computer vision and natural language
processing. Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in
resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the
generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To
facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest
and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution
images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets
supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios.
Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network
(MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet
introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module
(IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a
Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale
feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative
power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset

TL;DR: BiMa框架通过视觉和文本去偏方法提升文本-视频检索性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统因数据集中的视觉-语言偏差而忽略关键细节。

Method: 生成场景元素增强视频嵌入，并解耦文本特征为内容和偏差部分。

Result: 在五个主要TVR基准测试中表现优异，并在分布外检索任务中验证去偏能力。

Conclusion: BiMa有效减少偏差，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases
present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook
key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to
mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins
by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying
relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate
these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize
fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a
mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components,
enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling
biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five
major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo)
demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias
mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on
out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Result: 在多模态基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并通过可视化和消融研究验证了有效性。

Conclusion: UTAMoE有效缓解了任务目标冲突，为多模态大语言模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end
autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and
generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective
Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and
fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges,
often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing
solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of
fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of
AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a
Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal
AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization
subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall
coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive
experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task
objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various
tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness
of our approach.

Result: 实验证明ControlThinker有效减少语义鸿沟，提升视觉质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: ControlThinker通过语义增强和优化推理轨迹，显著改善了可控图像生成的效果。

Abstract: The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements,
with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control
signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the
semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target
images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional
details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel
framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by
incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from
control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic
understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for
additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising
from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of
reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output
reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts
and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic
consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are
available at https://github.com/Maplebb/ControlThinker.

Conclusion: 为基于第一人称视觉的动作描述生成6DoF操作轨迹提供了数据集和基线模型。

Abstract: Learning to use tools or objects in common scenes, particularly handling them
in various ways as instructed, is a key challenge for developing interactive
robots. Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a
large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for
various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper,
we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video
datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to
extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted
trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop
trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language
models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality
trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate
valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models
for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action
descriptions in egocentric vision.

Abstract: Edge computing decentralizes processing power to network edge, enabling
real-time AI-driven decision-making in IoT applications. In industrial
automation such as robotics and rugged edge AI, real-time perception and
intelligence are critical for autonomous operations. Deploying
transformer-based image captioning models at the edge can enhance machine
perception, improve scene understanding for autonomous robots, and aid in
industrial inspection.
  However, these edge or IoT devices are often constrained in computational
resources for physical agility, yet they have strict response time
requirements. Traditional deep learning models can be too large and
computationally demanding for these devices. In this research, we present
findings of transformer-based models for image captioning that operate
effectively on edge devices. By evaluating resource-effective transformer
models and applying knowledge distillation techniques, we demonstrate inference
can be accelerated on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model
performance using these techniques.

Abstract: Detecting lesions in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task in
medical image processing due to the diverse types, sizes, and locations of
lesions. Recently, various one-stage and two-stage framework networks have been
developed to focus on lesion localization. We introduce a one-stage lesion
detection framework, PDSE, by redesigning Retinanet to achieve higher accuracy
and efficiency for detecting lesions in multimodal CT images. Specifically, we
enhance the path aggregation flow by incorporating a low-level feature map.
Additionally, to improve model representation, we utilize the adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block and integrate channel feature map attention.
This approach has resulted in achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our
method significantly improves the detection of small and multiscaled objects.
When evaluated against other advanced algorithms on the public DeepLesion

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索VLMs如何通过视觉拼接能力绕过数据审核，即使有害图像被分割成看似无害的小块并分散在训练数据中，模型仍能整合这些片段并生成有害响应。

Method: 方法包括在三个数据集上验证VLMs的视觉拼接能力，通过将图像和唯一ID对分割为不同粒度的图像块和ID对进行微调，并模拟对抗性数据中毒场景。

Result: 结果显示，微调后的模型能够从完整图像或文本引用中正确识别ID，并证实有害内容可以通过视觉拼接绕过审核，构成严重的安全风险。

Conclusion: 结论指出视觉拼接能力是VLMs安全性的潜在威胁，需要新的数据审核方法来应对这种攻击。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

Abstract: Current benchmarks for sign language recognition (SLR) focus mainly on
isolated SLR, while there are limited datasets for continuous SLR (CSLR), which
recognizes sequences of signs in a video. Additionally, existing CSLR datasets
are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in
building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we
present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset
of its type and size that has been collected in an unconstrained environment
using signers' smartphone cameras. This setup resulted in high variations of
recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation
helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling
the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of
30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally,
the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for
all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language
translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language
understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence
CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT. The Isharah dataset is

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法仅依赖正样本且使用预训练阶段的扩散损失，无法有效提升主题保真度。

Method: SFO通过成对比较引导模型偏好正样本，CDNS自动生成有区分度的负样本，并重新加权扩散时间步以聚焦中间步骤。

Result: 实验表明，SFO在主题保真度和文本对齐方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SFO通过对比学习和CDNS有效提升了零样本主题驱动生成的性能。

Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning
framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject
fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive
targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces
synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives
over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose
Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates
distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and
textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the
diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject
details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS
significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text
alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark. Project page:

Abstract: A major challenge in finger vein recognition is the lack of large-scale
public datasets. Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples
per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To
address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing
diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn,

containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100
variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels,
skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also
the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning
applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and

Method: 结合SpatialMind（结构化提示策略）和ScanForgeQA（自动化构建的数据集），无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了提示和微调策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 框架为视觉空间理解的未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and
layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic
navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial
uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we
present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained
VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind,
a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions
into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable
question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an
automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined
effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights
that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

*Lingjun Mao,Rodolfo Corona,Xin Liang,Wenhao Yan,Zineng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOVE是一种动态视觉编码器，根据图像复杂度生成可变数量的视觉标记，显著减少标记数量同时保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器将图像映射为固定长度的标记序列，忽略了不同图像信息量的差异。

Method: 提出DOVE动态视觉编码器，生成可变数量的视觉标记以重建图像，并扩展为查询条件化标记化。

Result: DOVE在减少标记数量的同时保持高质量重建，并在多项任务中优于固定长度编码方法。

Conclusion: DOVE通过动态标记化和查询条件化，实现了更高效和有针对性的语义提取。

Abstract: Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of
tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of
information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room)
inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple
image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a
dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e.,
continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show
that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining
high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream
multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization
methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic
features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with
query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant
regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code
and checkpoints are available at https://dove-encoder.github.io/dove-encoder.

*Hansen Feng,Lizhi Wang,Yiqi Huang,Tong Li,Lin Zhu,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOND是一种新型盲原始图像去噪方法，通过合成数据训练，能泛化到未知相机数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法依赖相机特定数据，导致在未知相机数据上性能下降。

Method: 提出三个模块：CNE（粗到细噪声估计）、EM-VST（期望匹配方差稳定变换）、SNR-Net（信噪比引导去噪）。

Result: 在未知相机数据上表现优异，具有高度实用性。

Conclusion: YOND解决了相机依赖问题，提供了灵活的去噪解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photography has created a growing demand for a
practical blind raw image denoising method. Recently, learning-based methods
have become mainstream due to their excellent performance. However, most
existing learning-based methods suffer from camera-specific data dependency,
resulting in performance drops when applied to data from unknown cameras. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel blind raw image denoising method
named YOND, which represents You Only Need a Denoiser. Trained solely on
synthetic data, YOND can generalize robustly to noisy raw images captured by
diverse unknown cameras. Specifically, we propose three key modules to
guarantee the practicality of YOND: coarse-to-fine noise estimation (CNE),
expectation-matched variance-stabilizing transform (EM-VST), and SNR-guided
denoiser (SNR-Net). Firstly, we propose CNE to identify the camera noise
characteristic, refining the estimated noise parameters based on the coarse
denoised image. Secondly, we propose EM-VST to eliminate camera-specific data
dependency, correcting the bias expectation of VST according to the noisy
image. Finally, we propose SNR-Net to offer controllable raw image denoising,
supporting adaptive adjustments and manual fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
on unknown cameras, along with flexible solutions for challenging cases,
demonstrate the superior practicality of our method. The source code will be
publicly available at the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在情感表达和抽象艺术图像生成方面存在不足，主要缺乏大规模细粒度情感数据集。

Method: 提出了EmoArt数据集，包含132,664件艺术作品，涵盖56种绘画风格，每张图像有结构化标注。

Result: 通过EmoArt数据集，系统评估了流行文本到图像扩散模型的情感对齐能力。

Conclusion: EmoArt数据集为情感驱动的图像合成提供了重要数据和基准，推动了情感计算、多模态学习和计算艺术的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, text-to-image generation has
achieved significant progress in image resolution, detail fidelity, and
semantic alignment, particularly with models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, Stable
Diffusion XL, and FLUX 1. However, generating emotionally expressive and
abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of
large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present
the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art
datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g.,
Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and
cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene
descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line,
light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential
art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular
text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally
aligned images from text. Our work provides essential data and benchmarks for
emotion-driven image synthesis and aims to advance fields such as affective
computing, multimodal learning, and computational art, enabling applications in
art therapy and creative design. The dataset and more details can be accessed

Motivation: 解决Transformer在实时目标检测中计算复杂度高的问题，同时满足对全局上下文建模的需求。

Method: 提出MambaNeXt Block（CNN与Mamba混合设计）、MAFPN（多尺度特征融合）和边缘优化。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上达到66.6% mAP和31.9 FPS，支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: MambaNeXt-YOLO在实时目标检测中实现了高效与高精度的平衡。

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer
vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although
YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy,
the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of
Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high
computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which
limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these
challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba,
provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with
linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel
object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three
key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs
with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range
dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an
enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object
detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our
method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any
pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX and Orin NX.

TL;DR: INP-Former是一种新颖的异常检测方法，通过从测试图像中提取固有正常原型（INPs）来提升检测精度，无需依赖外部训练集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法依赖训练集中的正常参考图像，但外观和位置变化导致对齐困难，影响检测精度。作者发现异常图像中仍包含有价值的正常信息，可用于更准确的检测。

Method: 提出INP-Former，包括INP提取器（线性组合正常标记生成INPs）、INP一致性损失和INP引导的解码器。还引入软挖掘损失优化训练样本。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VisA和Real-IAD数据集上，INP-Former在单类、多类和少样本任务中达到SOTA性能，并展示零样本能力。改进版INP-Former++进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: INP-Former是一种通用且高效的异常检测方法，通过利用测试图像内部的正常信息显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical
diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to
normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and
positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test
image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as
local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal
information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more
aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information
originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external
normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that
extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image.
Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal
tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure
INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then
guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with
reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a
Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training.
INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class,
and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a
versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also
demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft
version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating
residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed
method significantly improves detection performance across single-class,
multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注数据导致领域偏差和低效部署，且现有零样本方法因粗粒度估计和开环流程限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入自适应采样策略生成视觉提示，结合2D和3D观察，通过3D手部速度采样高质量初始猜测，并利用闭环反馈优化结果。

Result: 在公开数据集和新基准测试中表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EgoLoc在自我中心视频的时序交互定位中实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Motivation: 深度学习模型常基于预训练模型加速训练，但可能延续编码偏见，因此需要研究这些偏见的具体表现。

Method: 使用线性分类器探针和激活可视化（地形图）评估ImageNet分类器中的偏见。

Result: 发现ImageNet分类器特别能区分年龄，对某些种族和中年性别也有较弱的区分能力。

Conclusion: ImageNet分类器在面部图像中存在对年龄、种族和性别的偏见，需进一步关注和解决。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often
accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of
perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations
of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering
intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the
biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as
topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers
particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the
models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in
middle-aged groups.

Abstract: This paper introduces a preprocessing technique to speed up
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) based pose estimation, which is critical for
real-time applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and
robotics. Our method leverages the concept of a dominating set from graph
theory to preprocess SfM models, significantly enhancing the speed of the pose

techniques. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in processing
speed, ranging from 1.5 to 14.48 times, and a reduction in reference images and
point cloud size by factors of 17-23 and 2.27-4, respectively. This work offers
a promising solution for efficient and accurate 3D pose estimation, balancing

TL;DR: BiXFormer通过统一模态匹配和跨模态对齐提升多模态语义分割性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态融合中未能充分发挥各模态优势，且对非RGB模态关注不足。

Method: 提出BiXFormer，将多模态输入分为RGB和X模态，分别处理，并引入UMM和CMA优化模态匹配和对齐。

Result: 在合成和真实多模态基准测试中，mIoU分别提升2.75%和22.74%。

Conclusion: BiXFormer有效提升多模态语义分割性能，尤其对非RGB模态和缺失模态具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing
complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse
features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified
representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to
fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate
multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and
propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross
Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing
modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into
RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing
separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established
pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X
modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching
(MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all
modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's
strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features
within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality
contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing
modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which
enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally
matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving
significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.

TL;DR: PART是一种自监督学习方法，通过连续相对变换克服网格方法的局限性，提升空间理解任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格方法无法捕捉真实世界物体组合的连续性和流动性，限制了表示学习的效果。

Method: PART利用离网格补丁间的连续相对变换，建模部分间的相对关系，实现更灵活的结构定位。

Result: 在对象检测和时间序列预测等任务中，PART优于MAE和DropPos等网格方法，全局分类任务表现也具竞争力。

Conclusion: PART突破了网格限制，为跨数据类型的通用自监督预训练开辟了新方向，潜力广泛。

Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object
positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for
representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively
explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid
structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute
position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches
fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object
compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to
overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a
continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid
structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and
deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object
detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based
methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on
global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking
free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for
universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural
images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and
audio.

Result: PRJ在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有系统，支持结构化毒性解释。

Conclusion: PRJ为AI生成内容的安全检测提供了更灵活和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled remarkable creative
capabilities, yet it also raises urgent concerns regarding the safety of
AI-generated visual content in real-world applications such as content
moderation, platform governance, and digital media regulation. This includes
unsafe material such as sexually explicit images, violent scenes, hate symbols,
propaganda, and unauthorized imitations of copyrighted artworks. Existing image
safety systems often rely on rigid category filters and produce binary outputs,
lacking the capacity to interpret context or reason about nuanced,
adversarially induced forms of harm. In addition, standard evaluation metrics
(e.g., attack success rate) fail to capture the semantic severity and dynamic
progression of toxicity. To address these limitations, we propose
Perception-Retrieval-Judgement (PRJ), a cognitively inspired framework that
models toxicity detection as a structured reasoning process. PRJ follows a
three-stage design: it first transforms an image into descriptive language
(perception), then retrieves external knowledge related to harm categories and
traits (retrieval), and finally evaluates toxicity based on legal or normative
rules (judgement). This language-centric structure enables the system to detect
both explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical
granularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a
contextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different
semantic dimensions. Experiments show that PRJ surpasses existing safety
checkers in detection accuracy and robustness while uniquely supporting
structured category-level toxicity interpretation.

<details>

Motivation: 传统分娩过程中的阴道检查方法主观且不准确，超声辅助诊断通过胎儿头部位置参数（AoP和HSD）提供客观评估，但需要准确分割胎儿头部和耻骨联合。

Method: 设计了DSSAU-Net，采用对称U形编码器-解码器架构，结合双稀疏选择注意力（DSSA）块和多尺度特征融合，减少计算复杂度并提取相关特征。

Result: 在MICCAI IUGC 2024竞赛中，DSSAU-Net在分类和分割任务中排名第四，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DSSAU-Net是一种高效且性能良好的网络架构，适用于胎儿头部和耻骨联合的分割任务。

Abstract: In the childbirth process, traditional methods involve invasive vaginal
examinations, but research has shown that these methods are both subjective and
inaccurate. Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis offers an objective yet effective way
to assess fetal head position via two key parameters: Angle of Progression
(AoP) and Head-Symphysis Distance (HSD), calculated by segmenting the fetal
head (FH) and pubic symphysis (PS), which aids clinicians in ensuring a smooth
delivery process. Therefore, accurate segmentation of FH and PS is crucial. In
this work, we propose a sparse self-attention network architecture with good
performance and high computational efficiency, named DSSAU-Net, for the
segmentation of FH and PS. Specifically, we stack varying numbers of Dual
Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) blocks at each stage to form a symmetric
U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture. For a given query, DSSA is
designed to explicitly perform one sparse token selection at both the region
and pixel levels, respectively, which is beneficial for further reducing
computational complexity while extracting the most relevant features. To
compensate for the information loss during the upsampling process, skip
connections with convolutions are designed. Additionally, multiscale feature
fusion is employed to enrich the model's global and local information. The
performance of DSSAU-Net has been validated using the Intrapartum Ultrasound
Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024 \textit{test set} provided by the organizer in the
MICCAI IUGC 2024

Motivation: 通过最优传输理论对齐视觉-语言特征，提升开集词汇语义分割的跨域泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段优化策略：第一阶段通过Sinkhorn距离解决最优传输问题，第二阶段用对齐方案指导CAT-Seg模型训练。

Result: 在MESS基准测试中，OV-COAST显著优于CAT-Seg和SAN-B模型，分别提升1.72%和4.9% mIoU。

Conclusion: OV-COAST通过最优传输理论有效提升了开集词汇语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic
labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically
leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization,
we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within
the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a
cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our
approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the
optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to
obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to
guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS
models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the
performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone,
achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 %
mIoU. The code is available at

Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solutions for the three egocentric
video localization tracks of the Ego4D Episodic Memory Challenge at CVPR 2025.
All tracks require precise localization of the interval within an untrimmed

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PlückeRF表示的多视角3D重建方法，通过结构化特征增强线连接3D表示与输入视图的像素光线，提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角和少视角3D重建方法在利用多视角信息方面仍有改进空间，需更有效地共享信息。

Method: 使用PlückeRF表示（结构化特征增强线）连接3D表示与输入视图的像素光线，优先共享邻近3D位置和像素光线的信息。

Result: 相比三平面表示和现有前馈重建方法，重建质量显著提升。

Conclusion: PlückeRF表示在多视角3D重建中更有效，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods aim to predict the 3D structure of a
scene directly from input images, providing a faster alternative to per-scene
optimization approaches. Significant progress has been made in single-view and
few-view reconstruction using learned priors that infer object shape and
appearance, even for unobserved regions. However, there is substantial
potential to enhance these methods by better leveraging information from
multiple views when available. To address this, we propose a few-view
reconstruction model that more effectively harnesses multi-view information.
Our approach introduces a simple mechanism that connects the 3D representation
with pixel rays from the input views, allowing for preferential sharing of
information between nearby 3D locations and between 3D locations and nearby
pixel rays. We achieve this by defining the 3D representation as a set of
structured, feature-augmented lines; the Pl\"uckeRF representation. Using this
representation, we demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality over the
equivalent triplane representation and state-of-the-art feedforward
reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: FSHNet通过SlotFormer块和动态稀疏标签分配策略，解决了稀疏3D检测器在长距离特征提取和网络优化中的问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏3D检测器仅从非空体素提取特征，导致长距离交互能力弱和中心特征缺失，影响特征提取和网络优化。

Method: 提出FSHNet，引入SlotFormer块增强稀疏编码器的长距离特征提取能力，采用动态稀疏标签分配策略优化网络，并加入稀疏上采样模块保留细节。

Result: 在Waymo、nuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: FSHNet有效解决了稀疏3D检测器的局限性，提升了长距离检测性能。

Abstract: Fully sparse 3D detectors have recently gained significant attention due to
their efficiency in long-range detection. However, sparse 3D detectors extract
features only from non-empty voxels, which impairs long-range interactions and
causes the center feature missing. The former weakens the feature extraction
capability, while the latter hinders network optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Fully Sparse Hybrid Network (FSHNet). FSHNet
incorporates a proposed SlotFormer block to enhance the long-range feature
extraction capability of existing sparse encoders. The SlotFormer divides
sparse voxels using a slot partition approach, which, compared to traditional
window partition, provides a larger receptive field. Additionally, we propose a
dynamic sparse label assignment strategy to deeply optimize the network by
providing more high-quality positive samples. To further enhance performance,
we introduce a sparse upsampling module to refine downsampled voxels,
preserving fine-grained details crucial for detecting small objects. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FSHNet. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统位置编码方法缺乏鲁棒性和灵活性，RoPE虽然有所改进，但其旋转矩阵是手动定义的，限制了模型能力。

Method: 通过定义可训练的交换角度矩阵，确保RoPE的可扩展性和位置鲁棒性，提出了RoPE方程并提供了两种解决方案。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，训练分辨率和高分辨率下分别提升了1.6%和2.9%。

Conclusion: ComRoPE不仅提升了性能，还为未来位置编码研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was
proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode
positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit
significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position.
Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these
issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in
the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation
matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity.
In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in
terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that
pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve
scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation,
which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with
position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of
trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE
equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher
resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows
versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new
insights for future positional encoding research. To ensure reproducibility,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在超分辨率任务中因计算成本高而采用非重叠窗口的自注意力计算，忽略了通道间和空间结构信息。

Method: 引入高效通道与窗口协同注意力组（CWSAG）和空间与窗口协同注意力组（SWSAG），分别增强非局部特征融合和结构化特征提取。

Result: SAAT在相同参数量下性能与SOTA相当，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SAAT通过协同利用通道和空间注意力机制，显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to
restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models
based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However,
current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to
save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only
focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across
channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the
intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have,
respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual
tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure
relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial
attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a
novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can
better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the
Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial
& Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines
efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local
feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other
hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature
information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural
features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves
performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same
quantity of parameters.

Abstract: Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour
due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and
humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and
understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in
forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in
these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for
human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive
representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature
representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the
interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides,
we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both
spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical
features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be
released when this paper is published.

Conclusion: CoLa模型通过组合性和学习学习能力，实现了高效泛化和零样本识别，展示了跨数据集泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Humans can decompose Chinese characters into compositional components and
recombine them to recognize unseen characters. This reflects two cognitive
principles: Compositionality, the idea that complex concepts are built on
simpler parts; and Learning-to-learn, the ability to learn strategies for
decomposing and recombining components to form new concepts. These principles
provide inductive biases that support efficient generalization. They are
critical to Chinese character recognition (CCR) in solving the zero-shot
problem, which results from the common long-tail distribution of Chinese
character datasets. Existing methods have made substantial progress in modeling
compositionality via predefined radical or stroke decomposition. However, they
often ignore the learning-to-learn capability, limiting their ability to
generalize beyond human-defined schemes. Inspired by these principles, we
propose a deep latent variable model that learns Compositional Latent
components of Chinese characters (CoLa) without relying on human-defined
decomposition schemes. Recognition and matching can be performed by comparing
compositional latent components in the latent space, enabling zero-shot
character recognition. The experiments illustrate that CoLa outperforms
previous methods in both character the radical zero-shot CCR. Visualization
indicates that the learned components can reflect the structure of characters
in an interpretable way. Moreover, despite being trained on historical
documents, CoLa can analyze components of oracle bone characters, highlighting
its cross-dataset generalization ability.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context
learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically
focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists
employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a
straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then
masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt
confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address
this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of
image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning
with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware
aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query
representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also
consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of
homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is
effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the
model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like,
context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText
model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain
benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferenas/ConText.

Abstract: Automatically estimating animal poses from videos is important for studying
animal behaviors. Existing methods do not perform reliably since they are
trained on datasets that are not comprehensive enough to capture all necessary
animal behaviors. However, it is very challenging to collect such datasets due
to the large variations in animal morphology. In this paper, we propose an
animal pose labeling pipeline that follows a different strategy, i.e. test time
optimization. Given a video, we fine-tune a lightweight appearance embedding
inside a pre-trained general-purpose point tracker on a sparse set of annotated
frames. These annotations can be obtained from human labelers or off-the-shelf
pose detectors. The fine-tuned model is then applied to the rest of the frames
for automatic labeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a
reasonable annotation cost. We believe our pipeline offers a valuable tool for
the automatic quantification of animal behavior. Visit our project webpage at

Conclusion: JointSplat通过联合优化光流和深度，实现了高保真稀疏视角3D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge
with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view
reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view
synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view
datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite
offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation
and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from
mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the
latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable
matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we
propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity
between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization
mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information
fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow
during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel
multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision
while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on
RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed
probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity
sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Result: 在三种数据集上实现约2.5倍加速，平均准确率仅下降0.55%（ViViT）。

Conclusion: 视频token合并是一种高效且无需重新训练的方法，适用于多种视频Transformer模型。

Abstract: Video transformer models require huge amounts of compute resources due to the
spatio-temporal scaling of the input. Tackling this, recent methods have
proposed to drop or merge tokens for image models, whether randomly or via
learned methods. Merging tokens has many benefits: it can be plugged into any
vision transformer, does not require model re-training, and it propagates
information that would otherwise be dropped through the model. Before now,
video token merging has not been evaluated on temporally complex datasets for
video understanding. In this work, we explore training-free token merging for
video to provide comprehensive experiments and find best practices across four
video transformers on three datasets that exhibit coarse and fine-grained
action recognition. Our results showcase the benefits of video token merging
with a speedup of around $2.5$X while maintaining accuracy (avg. $-0.55\%$ for
ViViT). Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频增强方法多为顺序处理，效率低下且效果不佳，未考虑多因素共同降质。

Method: DSFN网络包含联合去模糊和超分辨率模块（JDSR）以及基于三帧的帧插值模块（TFBFI），直接处理多降质因素。

Result: 实验表明，DSFN在公共数据集上优于现有顺序方法，网络更小且处理更快。

Conclusion: DSFN通过联合处理多降质因素，实现了高效且高质量的视频增强。

Abstract: Video quality is often severely degraded by multiple factors rather than a
single factor. These low-quality videos can be restored to high-quality videos
by sequentially performing appropriate video enhancement techniques. However,
the sequential approach was inefficient and sub-optimal because most video
enhancement approaches were designed without taking into account that multiple
factors together degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose a new joint
video enhancement method that mitigates multiple degradation factors
simultaneously by resolving an integrated enhancement problem. Our proposed
network, named DSFN, directly produces a high-resolution, high-frame-rate, and
clear video from a low-resolution, low-frame-rate, and blurry video. In the
DSFN, low-resolution and blurry input frames are enhanced by a joint deblurring
and super-resolution (JDSR) module. Meanwhile, intermediate frames between
input adjacent frames are interpolated by a triple-frame-based frame
interpolation (TFBFI) module. The proper combination of the proposed modules of
DSFN can achieve superior performance on the joint video enhancement task.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other sequential
state-of-the-art techniques on public datasets with a smaller network size and
faster processing time.

Conclusion: 噪声注入训练是事件数据分类系统中传统滤波方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
cameras, especially in scenarios involving rapid motion or challenging lighting
conditions. However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise,
negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models.
Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms
to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this
paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to
enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise.
Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data,
enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted
extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets
(N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures,
including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural
Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our
noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of
noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and
achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable
alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object
classification system. Code: https://github.com/vision-agh/DVS_Filtering

Motivation: 现有CDFSL框架依赖人工设计的训练和测试机制，pCDFSL更贴近实际应用需求。

Result: 在四个CDFSL基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIST框架有效解决了pCDFSL任务中的挑战，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a practical cross-domain few-shot learning (pCDFSL)
task, where a large-scale pre-trained model like CLIP can be easily deployed on
a target dataset. The goal is to simultaneously classify all unseen classes
under extreme domain shifts, by utilizing only a few labeled samples per class.
The pCDFSL paradigm is source-free and moves beyond artificially created
episodic training and testing regimes followed by existing CDFSL frameworks,
making it more challenging and relevant to real-world applications. Towards
that goal, we propose a novel framework, termed MIST (MultIple STochastic
Prompt tuning), where multiple stochastic prompts are utilized to handle
significant domain and semantic shifts. Specifically, multiple prompts are
learnt for each class, effectively capturing multiple peaks in the input data.
Furthermore, instead of representing the weights of the multiple prompts as
point-estimates, we model them as learnable Gaussian distributions with two
different strategies, encouraging an efficient exploration of the prompt
parameter space, which mitigate overfitting due to the few labeled training
samples. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods
on four CDFSL benchmarks adapted to this setting, show the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法在Vision Projector中压缩视觉令牌会导致视觉信息丢失，尤其是需要细粒度空间关系的任务（如OCR和图表理解）。

Conclusion: Vision Remember在不牺牲效率的情况下提升了性能，适用于细粒度视觉任务。

Abstract: In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model.
Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory
and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision
Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in
the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for
tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \&
Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which
is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to
re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision
features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the
text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a
local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing
local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves
computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual
information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the

TL;DR: DiffCAP是一种基于扩散的净化策略，能有效中和视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的对抗性扰动，显著提升模型在对抗环境中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在对抗性扰动下容易产生错误输出，影响实际应用的可靠性，因此需要一种高效的防御方法。

Method: DiffCAP通过逐步注入高斯噪声并利用预训练扩散模型去噪，中和对抗性扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，DiffCAP显著优于现有防御技术，并减少了超参数调整和去噪时间。

Conclusion: DiffCAP为对抗环境中安全部署VLMs提供了强大且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a
significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite
often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter
model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper
introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can
effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding
minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its
latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP
cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input
data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy
images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach
to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion
model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean
representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive
experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths
in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing
defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly
reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time,
thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical
and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for
securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的mL1-ACE损失函数，用于改善医学图像分割的校准性能，同时保持分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在医学图像分割中过度自信的问题，提升预测的可信度和临床实用性。

Method: 通过硬分箱和软分箱方法优化像素级校准，引入mL1-ACE作为辅助损失函数。

Result: 在四个数据集上显著降低了校准误差（ACE和MCE），同时保持了较高的Dice系数。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了分割预测的可信度，有助于深度学习在临床中的安全应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident,
compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose
differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE)
as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both
hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration.
Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that
incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly
Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while
largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the
soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the
Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation
performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance,
albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into
calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we
introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image
reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment
between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not
only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows
potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical
workflows. We share our code here:

TL;DR: MS-YOLO是一种基于YOLOv11的改进模型，通过多尺度扩张残差模块、动态跨路径特征增强模块和轻量自适应权重下采样模块，显著提升了血细胞检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动显微镜方法效率低且准确性不足，现有自动化检测方法成本高且精度有限，尤其是重叠细胞和多尺度目标的检测问题。

Method: 提出MS-YOLO模型，包含三个关键模块：MS-DRM（多尺度扩张残差模块）、DCFEM（动态跨路径特征增强模块）和LADS（轻量自适应权重下采样模块）。

Result: 在CBC基准测试中，mAP@50达到97.4%，优于现有模型，且在WBCDD数据集上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO具有轻量级架构和实时推理效率，满足临床部署需求，为标准化血液病理评估提供了可靠技术支持。

Abstract: Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical
diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time
inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection
approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy.
While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent
challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder
practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a
blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three
key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically,
the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2
modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature
enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the
backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature
representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS)
improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing
computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate
that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale
objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of
97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary
WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with
a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets
clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for
standardized blood pathology assessment.

Motivation: AI生成图像质量高，难以区分真伪，检测器在对抗条件下的鲁棒性常被忽视。

Method: 创建RAID数据集，包含72k对抗样本，通过攻击七种先进检测器和四种文本到图像模型生成。

Result: 对抗样本对未见检测器具有高迁移成功率，当前检测器易被欺骗。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的检测方法，RAID数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are
incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the
inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images
is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the
presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually
evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness
is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial
effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,
we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of
AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of
AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable
adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an
ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four
different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology
generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen
detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still
reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate
that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily
deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the
development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义类别名称，限制了其适用性，尤其是在类别名称难以指定或不可用的情况下。

Method: 提出Similarity Mapping（SiM），通过计算目标实例与一组通用提示（文本或视觉）的相似性分数进行分类，无需精心设计的提示。

Result: SiM表现优异，计算高效（学习映射通常不到一秒），且具有可解释性。

Conclusion: SiM为词汇无关少样本学习提供了重要基线，未来研究可在此基础上展开。

Abstract: Recent advances in few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
greatly expanded their ability to generalize across tasks using only a few
labeled examples. However, existing approaches primarily build upon the strong
zero-shot priors of these models by leveraging carefully designed,
task-specific prompts. This dependence on predefined class names can restrict
their applicability, especially in scenarios where exact class names are
unavailable or difficult to specify. To address this limitation, we introduce
vocabulary-free few-shot learning for VLMs, a setting where target class
instances - that is, images - are available but their corresponding names are
not. We propose Similarity Mapping (SiM), a simple yet effective baseline that
classifies target instances solely based on similarity scores with a set of
generic prompts (textual or visual), eliminating the need for carefully
handcrafted prompts. Although conceptually straightforward, SiM demonstrates
strong performance, operates with high computational efficiency (learning the
mapping typically takes less than one second), and provides interpretability by
linking target classes to generic prompts. We believe that our approach could
serve as an important baseline for future research in vocabulary-free few-shot
learning. Code is available at

TL;DR: Rex-Thinker是一个基于显式思维链推理的对象指代模型，通过结构化推理提高预测的可解释性和可靠性，并在实验中表现优于基线方法。

Motivation: 现有对象指代模型缺乏可解释性和对无匹配对象的拒绝能力，Rex-Thinker旨在通过显式推理解决这些问题。

Method: 模型将对象指代任务分解为候选对象识别和逐步推理评估，使用HumanRef-CoT数据集进行训练，结合监督学习和强化学习。

Result: 实验表明Rex-Thinker在精度和可解释性上优于基线，且能更好地拒绝无匹配对象的输出。

Conclusion: Rex-Thinker通过结构化推理显著提升了对象指代任务的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Object referring aims to detect all objects in an image that match a given
natural language description. We argue that a robust object referring model
should be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and
faithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key
properties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies
its predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,
by learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given
expression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box
prediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject
expressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a
model that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given
a referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances
corresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs
step-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the
given expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,
we construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by
prompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a
structured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to
learn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train
Rex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach
the model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL
learning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our
approach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability
on in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject
hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多任务中表现出色，但幻觉问题严重，主要源于模态不对齐和底层大型语言模型的固有幻觉。现有方法忽视图像-文本模态对齐，导致过度依赖语言模型和幻觉。

Method: 提出Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO)，增强模态对齐，并利用开源指令数据集自动构建高质量多模态偏好数据。

Conclusion: EMPO通过多模态偏好优化有效减少幻觉问题，为大型视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often
challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality
misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language
Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning
model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality
alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this
paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO),
which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference
alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically
construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image,
instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and
five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO,
e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on
MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Monitoring aerial objects is crucial for security, wildlife conservation, and
environmental studies. Traditional RGB-based approaches struggle with
challenges such as scale variations, motion blur, and high-speed object
movements, especially for small flying entities like insects and drones. In
this work, we explore the potential of event-based vision for detecting and
recognizing flying objects, in particular animals that may not follow short and
long-term predictable patters. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution,
low latency, and robustness to motion blur, making them well-suited for this
task. We introduce EV-Flying, an event-based dataset of flying objects,
comprising manually annotated birds, insects and drones with spatio-temporal
bounding boxes and track identities. To effectively process the asynchronous
event streams, we employ a point-based approach leveraging lightweight
architectures inspired by PointNet. Our study investigates the classification
of flying objects using point cloud-based event representations. The proposed
dataset and methodology pave the way for more efficient and reliable aerial
object recognition in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频去模糊算法未能充分利用相邻帧信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: DAN包含预处理网络（PPN）、基于对齐的解卷积网络（ABDN）和帧聚合网络（FAN），分别处理模糊输入、解卷积和聚合去模糊帧。

Result: 在公开数据集上，DAN在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAN通过合理结合三个子网络，有效利用相邻帧信息，显著提升了视频去模糊性能。

Abstract: In contrast to single-image deblurring, video deblurring has the advantage
that neighbor frames can be utilized to deblur a target frame. However,
existing video deblurring algorithms often fail to properly employ the neighbor
frames, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
deconvolution and aggregation network (DAN) for video deblurring that utilizes
the information of neighbor frames well. In DAN, both deconvolution and
aggregation strategies are achieved through three sub-networks: the
preprocessing network (PPN) and the alignment-based deconvolution network
(ABDN) for the deconvolution scheme; the frame aggregation network (FAN) for
the aggregation scheme. In the deconvolution part, blurry inputs are first
preprocessed by the PPN with non-local operations. Then, the output frames from
the PPN are deblurred by the ABDN based on the frame alignment. In the FAN,
these deblurred frames from the deconvolution part are combined into a latent
frame according to reliability maps which infer pixel-wise sharpness. The
proper combination of three sub-networks can achieve favorable performance on
video deblurring by using the neighbor frames suitably. In experiments, the
proposed DAN was demonstrated to be superior to existing state-of-the-art
methods through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce GlobalBuildingAtlas, a publicly available dataset providing
global and complete coverage of building polygons, heights and Level of Detail
1 (LoD1) 3D building models. This is the first open dataset to offer high
quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the
individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed
machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights
(called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also
a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality
polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons,
including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide,
GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1

Finally, we generated a global LoD1 building model (called GBA.LoD1) from the

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine
details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with
complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper,
we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and
optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our
approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and
surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated,
varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into
standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view
stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined
with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV,
LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing
fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The
present paper is an extended version of the earlier conference paper by Brument
et al. (in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024), featuring an accelerated and more robust
algorithm as well as a broader empirical evaluation. The code and data relative

<details>

Motivation: 传统2D指标（如IoU和CPD）在复杂3D场景中难以找到关键匹配，影响感知系统的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 引入Contour Errors（CEs），通过比较自车坐标系中的边界框，从功能角度评估匹配。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，CEs在跟踪检测方法中优于IoU和CPD，减少了80%（近距离）和60%（远距离）的功能性失败。

Conclusion: CEs是一种更有效的3D跟踪匹配度量标准，显著提升了感知系统的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the
accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications
such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors,
enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and
safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and
Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often
fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation,
we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for
identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional
perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour
errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors
improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD
metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show
that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges
and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CSV2S任务中因中间文本导致的错误传播和时序不对齐问题。

Method: 提出UniCUE框架，整合CSR任务，引入细粒度语义对齐池、VisioPhonetic适配器和姿态感知视觉处理器。

Result: 在中文CS数据集上，词错误率降低78.3%，唇语同步性提升32%。

Conclusion: UniCUE有效解决了CSV2S任务中的关键挑战，性能显著优于单任务方法。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise
speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech
generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos)
of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct
generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor
performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS
Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on
this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech
system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for
stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and
temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS
videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose
UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in
the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic
information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1)
a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between
visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge
cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two
distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is
introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and
hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS
dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our
UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech
synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试主要关注理解任务，缺乏对多帧证据定位和深度推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出MMR-V基准测试，包含长距离多帧推理、超越感知的隐藏信息推理、人工标注任务和干扰项设计。

Result: 当前模型在多模态推理上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅52.5%，且现有推理增强策略效果有限。

Conclusion: MMR-V揭示了多模态推理与文本推理的差异，希望推动相关研究。

Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and
conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus
on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in
the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few
adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for
Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the
following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required
to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.
(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception
alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks
are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to
align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor
annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos
and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with
multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only
52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies
(Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further
analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from
it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains.
We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal
reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 提出的统一系统有效解决了属性不平衡和语义信息利用问题，提升了行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a very important task in video
surveillance systems such as tracking people, finding people in public places,
or analysing customer behavior in supermarkets. Although there have been many
works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as
large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data
(attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online
stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are
not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system
consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO),
Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main
point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN
and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter
the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as
Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of
attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We
experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results
have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the
higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art
Re-ID methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但在指令驱动的图像编辑中，尤其是涉及大幅布局变化的结构不一致编辑时表现不佳。

Method: 提出IEAP框架，基于Diffusion Transformer架构，将编辑指令分解为原子操作，每个操作由轻量级适配器实现，并通过VLM代理编程。

Result: IEAP在标准基准测试中显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂多步指令编辑中表现出更高的准确性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: IEAP通过模块化和序列化编辑操作，为结构不一致的编辑任务提供了通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image
editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly
struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout
changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a
unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a
reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of
atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter
sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit.
Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations
collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent
transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP
generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple
adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our
framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for
complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at

Motivation: 3DGS需要大量GPU内存，限制了其在计算资源受限设备上的应用。现有方法通常需要微调且缺乏对不同设备内存需求的适应性。

Method: 引入了一个小型可学习模块，根据输入百分比控制高斯选择，并通过变换模块调整所选高斯以补充减少模型的性能。

Result: 在ZipNeRF、MipNeRF和Tanks&Temples场景上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不增加微调负担的情况下，显著提升3DGS的渲染性能，适应不同设备的特定内存需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has enabled various applications in 3D scene
representation and novel view synthesis due to its efficient rendering
capabilities. However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting
its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches
have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS
but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the
specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic
inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our
method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial
rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny
learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input
percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected
Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive
experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\&Temples scenes demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://flexgs.github.io.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑是否需要昂贵的联合训练来实现语言-图像对齐，探索预训练的固定LLM是否能作为足够好的文本编码器指导视觉表示学习。

Method: 提出LIFT框架，固定LLM的文本编码器，仅训练图像编码器，简化了训练过程。

Result: LIFT在涉及组合理解和长标题的场景中优于CLIP，同时显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: LIFT为探索LLM文本嵌入如何指导视觉学习提供了初步尝试，并提出了学习语言对齐视觉表示的替代设计选择。

Abstract: Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image
alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive
learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such
a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a
pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder
to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn
Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by
training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive
benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework
LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve
compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable
gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards
systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual
learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning
language-aligned visual representations.

Motivation: 目标检测器在训练数据（源域）和真实数据（目标域）之间存在较大域差距时性能下降，扩散模型具有提取跨域特征的潜力。

Method: 在源域上训练冻结权重的扩散模型作为教师模型，生成目标域的伪标签，指导学生模型在目标域上的监督学习。

Result: 在6个数据集上平均mAP提升21.2%，超越当前SOTA方法5.7% mAP，且在更复杂模型中仍有效。

Conclusion: DDT方法简单有效，具有广泛的域适应能力，显著提升了跨域目标检测性能。

Abstract: Object detectors often suffer a decrease in performance due to the large
domain gap between the training data (source domain) and real-world data
(target domain). Diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable
abilities in generating high-quality and diverse images, suggesting their
potential for extracting valuable feature from various domains. To effectively
leverage the cross-domain feature representation of diffusion models, in this
paper, we train a detector with frozen-weight diffusion model on the source
domain, then employ it as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels on the
unlabeled target domain, which are used to guide the supervised learning of the
student model on the target domain. We refer to this approach as Diffusion
Domain Teacher (DDT). By employing this straightforward yet potent framework,
we significantly improve cross-domain object detection performance without
compromising the inference speed. Our method achieves an average mAP
improvement of 21.2% compared to the baseline on 6 datasets from three common
cross-domain detection benchmarks (Cross-Camera, Syn2Real, Real2Artistic},
surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average of 5.7%
mAP. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
consistently brings improvements even in more powerful and complex models,
highlighting broadly applicable and effective domain adaptation capability of
our DDT. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullDiT2 improves efficiency in video diffusion transformers by reducing computational redundancy in context conditioning, achieving faster performance with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic computation overhead in existing in-context conditioning methods for video generation, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Introduces FullDiT2 with dynamic token selection and selective context caching to reduce redundancy in context tokens and interactions.

Result: Achieves 2-3 times speedup per diffusion step with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: FullDiT2 offers an efficient and general framework for controllable video generation and editing.

Abstract: Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers
has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context
Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video
generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context
conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token
sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite
their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task
complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study
the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video
generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key
sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within
context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent
interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we
propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general
controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates
from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2
leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important
context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.
Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize
redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive
experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks
demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3
times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal
degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality. The project

Conclusion: 模型通过交互式对象感知生成声音，验证了注意力机制与分割掩模的功能近似性。

Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging,
especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this
paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that
grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our
method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion
model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds
through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image
segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em
object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism
functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated
audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between
objects and their associated sounds. Project page:

Result: 在六个视频编辑任务上表现优异，并展现出任务组合能力。

Conclusion: UNIC通过统一框架实现了高效、灵活的视频编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in
generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific
architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations
(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing
conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we
introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective
framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an
in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of
various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,
the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary
according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key
insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token
sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,
thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,
direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe
token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and
diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce
task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and
condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different
editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video
editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in
context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we
construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video
editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior
performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.

Motivation: 探索LMMs是否仅通过结构化2D输入（而非显式3D输入）实现空间推理。

Method: 提出Struct2D框架，结合BEV图像、对象标记和元数据，并构建Struct2D-Set数据集进行微调。

Result: LMMs在结构化2D输入下表现出色，微调后的Qwen2.5VL在多个任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化2D输入可有效连接感知与语言推理，无需3D输入。

Abstract: Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for
enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts
often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask:
can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived
from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework
that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric
metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using
Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs
(e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning
abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks
such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these
insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset
with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories,
generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM
(Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple
benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object
grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively
bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D
representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support
future research.

Abstract: Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand
the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera
trajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects
from text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes
remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a
novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud
sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing
approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction
with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D
reconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo).
Our method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video
Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth
video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global
coherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point
culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for
iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data
Engine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation
and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse
training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these
designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality
and geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.

Result: 能够生成平滑的分层视频，支持多种变体任务。

Conclusion: LayerFlow通过统一框架和多阶段训练策略，有效解决了分层视频生成的挑战。

Abstract: We present LayerFlow, a unified solution for layer-aware video generation.
Given per-layer prompts, LayerFlow generates videos for the transparent
foreground, clean background, and blended scene. It also supports versatile
variants like decomposing a blended video or generating the background for the
given foreground and vice versa. Starting from a text-to-video diffusion
transformer, we organize the videos for different layers as sub-clips, and
leverage layer embeddings to distinguish each clip and the corresponding
layer-wise prompts. In this way, we seamlessly support the aforementioned
variants in one unified framework. For the lack of high-quality layer-wise
training videos, we design a multi-stage training strategy to accommodate
static images with high-quality layer annotations. Specifically, we first train
the model with low-quality video data. Then, we tune a motion LoRA to make the
model compatible with static frames. Afterward, we train the content LoRA on
the mixture of image data with high-quality layered images along with
copy-pasted video data. During inference, we remove the motion LoRA thus
generating smooth videos with desired layers.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了现有模型的局限性，显著提升了缺失模态预测的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing
modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize
existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total
of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of
prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals
that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i)
fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust
validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and,
at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an
agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework
dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input
context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic
features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which
iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through
internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for
missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by
at least 10% compared to baselines.

as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT
projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several
collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each
collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the
gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic
reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only
utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the
correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the
radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction
pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured
using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches
significantly reduce random noise in the reconstructed images without blurring
the sharp features of the observed objects. Equivalently, our methods can
achieve the same reconstruction quality as gating-based methods but with a
lower radiation dose. Our code is available at github.com/PeriodRecon.

*George Webber,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P. King,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过图像配准生成个性化伪PET图像的方法，用于提升低计数数据下的PET重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法利用预训练扩散模型重建PET图像，但缺乏个性化数据支持。本文旨在通过多受试者PET-MR扫描数据生成受试者特异性伪PET图像，以提升重建效果。

Method: 通过图像配准技术在不同受试者的解剖结构间转换，生成受试者特异性伪PET图像，并用于预训练个性化扩散模型。

Result: 在模拟和真实[$^{18}$F]FDG数据集中，该方法显著提升了低计数数据下的重建精度，且在保留PET独有特征与MR特征之间取得了更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖生成式深度学习或大规模训练数据集，即可生成患者特异性PET图像，为医学影像任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent work has shown improved lesion detectability and flexibility to
reconstruction hyperparameters (e.g. scanner geometry or dose level) when PET
images are reconstructed by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. Such
methods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but
still noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for
generating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR
scans, synthesizing "pseudo-PET" images by transforming between different
patients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain
information from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the
retention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images.
With simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a
personalized diffusion model with subject-specific "pseudo-PET" images improves
reconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows
promise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly
imposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between
reconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET
and MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data
has further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because
patient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative
deep learning or large training datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了DIPP和DISH两个系统，用于解决CubeSat上图像处理管道的灵活性和复杂性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSat资源受限且部署在太空，限制了图像处理管道的灵活性和复杂性。

Method: DIPP是模块化、可配置的图像处理管道框架；DISH是领域特定语言和运行时系统，用于调度复杂成像任务。

Result: 实验表明DIPP分解管道几乎无额外开销，DISH与Lua相比内存需求更低且表达力相当。

Conclusion: DIPP和DISH有效提升了CubeSat上图像处理管道的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: CubeSats offer a low-cost platform for space research, particularly for Earth
observation. However, their resource-constrained nature and being in space,
challenge the flexibility and complexity of the deployed image processing
pipelines and their orchestration. This paper introduces two novel systems,
DIPP and DISH, to address these challenges. DIPP is a modular and configurable
image processing pipeline framework that allows for adaptability to changing
mission goals even after deployment, while preserving robustness. DISH is a
domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex
imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors.
  Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing
pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network
requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module
uploads. Furthermore, we compare DISH to Lua, a general purpose scripting
language, and demonstrate its comparable expressiveness and lower memory
requirement.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的动态光声成像重建方法，通过稀疏传感器数据提升图像质量和时间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光声成像方法在稀疏数据下产生严重伪影，且未考虑动态成像中的帧间关系。INR为解决稀疏数据逆问题提供了新思路。

Method: 利用INR将动态光声图像表示为隐式函数，仅需时空坐标输入，无需外部训练数据或先验图像。结合低秩和稀疏性正则化。

Result: 在两种稀疏条件下优于传统方法，有效抑制伪影并保证图像质量。

Conclusion: INR方法为动态光声成像提供了一种高效、高质量的重建方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging
technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing
high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than
traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and
geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the
imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic
(PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data,
produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not
consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution
is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by
the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser
technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a
powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by
characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates
in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to
improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and
enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input.
Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as
implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the
network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the
need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong
implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit
regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms
traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions,
effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce
radiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating

improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances
parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report
generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments
conducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR
outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学分辨率光声显微镜（OR-PAM）因高斯光束的窄景深限制，无法在深度方向解析足够细节。

Method: 采用轻量级Siamese网络，结合抗伪影的通道空间频率特征融合规则，并使用U-Net感知损失函数进行端到端训练。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持横向分辨率的同时，实现了高质量的光声显微镜图像融合。

Conclusion: Dc-EEMF方法有望成为临床和临床前研究中扩展景深的实用工具。

Abstract: Photoacoustic microscopy holds the potential to measure biomarkers'
structural and functional status without labels, which significantly aids in
comprehending pathophysiological conditions in biomedical research. However,
conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is hindered
by a limited depth-of-field (DoF) due to the narrow depth range focused on a
Gaussian beam. Consequently, it fails to resolve sufficient details in the
depth direction. Herein, we propose a decision-level constrained end-to-end
multi-focus image fusion (Dc-EEMF) to push DoF limit of PAM. The DC-EEMF method
is a lightweight siamese network that incorporates an artifact-resistant
channel-wise spatial frequency as its feature fusion rule. The meticulously
crafted U-Net-based perceptual loss function for decision-level focus
properties in end-to-end fusion seamlessly integrates the complementary
advantages of spatial domain and transform domain methods within Dc-EEMF. This
approach can be trained end-to-end without necessitating post-processing
procedures. Experimental results and numerical analyses collectively
demonstrate our method's robust performance, achieving an impressive fusion
result for PAM images without a substantial sacrifice in lateral resolution.
The utilization of Dc-EEMF-powered PAM has the potential to serve as a
practical tool in preclinical and clinical studies requiring extended DoF for
various applications.

Result: 该方法在计算效率上优于传统PD-AI方法，同时保持重建质量，且优于标准临床方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限设备上的高分辨率MRI重建提供了可能，展示了实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have
emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher
spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans
generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage,
and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI,
where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands.
Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI
reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage
bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware
efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches,
which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we
propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge
computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating
redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves
computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to
conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our
approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on
resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides
crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However,
rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a
significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such
as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and
hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet
quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer
variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for
comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset.
We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver
patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with
expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal
tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis,
and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art
multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as
baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results
demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver
assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000
individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that
develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and
minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic
tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost,
multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can
identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile
application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of
wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure
to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer
vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images,
which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS
app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite
challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions.
The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals
to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess
critical parameters related to wound care.

Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies'
heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades,
surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading
to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond
Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with
sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This
procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to
induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique
for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient
preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are
currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection.
Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite
element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and
required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this
research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of
patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure
during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating
personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs,
incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness,
and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed
to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support
vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13.
Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical
scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial
index (CI).

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level
computer vision, where deep learning technologies have played a significant
role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led
to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the
usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are
primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's
potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed
in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed
development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we
present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution
models, investigating each component and discussing its implications.
Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed
by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying
methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends,
requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of
deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level
taxonomy to guide current and future VSR research, enhancing the maturation and
interpretation of VSR practices for various practical applications.

regarding processing time, variability in tracer types, and challenges in
multimodal integration.
  METHODS: We developed petBrain, a novel end-to-end processing pipeline for
amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and structural MRI. It leverages deep learning-based
segmentation, standardized biomarker quantification (Centiloid, CenTauR,
HAVAs), and simultaneous estimation of A, T2, and N biomarkers. The pipeline is
implemented as a web-based platform, requiring no local computational
infrastructure or specialized software knowledge.
  RESULTS: petBrain provides reliable and rapid biomarker quantification, with
results comparable to existing pipelines for A and T2. It shows strong
concordance with data processed in ADNI databases. The staging and
quantification of A/T2/N by petBrain demonstrated good agreement with
CSF/plasma biomarkers, clinical status, and cognitive performance.
  DISCUSSION: petBrain represents a powerful and openly accessible platform for
standardized AD biomarker analysis, facilitating applications in clinical
research.

planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding
annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description
and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose
OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球范围内常见且危及生命的疾病，早期检测对患者结果至关重要。

Method: 结合视觉变换器（EVA02）和设计的卷积ViT混合模型（EdgeNeXtSAC），采用分割辅助分类流程，并通过梯度提升决策树（GBDT）集成预测结果。

Result: 在部分AUC（pAUC）高于80%真阳性率（TPR）的评估指标下，达到了0.1755的最高值。

Conclusion: 混合可解释AI系统在远程医疗和资源有限环境中具有皮肤癌分诊的潜力。

Abstract: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases
worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work
presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying
malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024,
which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body
Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our
method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT
hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a
segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization.
Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree
(GBDT) ensemble enriched by engineered features and patient-specific relational
metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment
malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a
diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a
3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate
(TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the
highest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of
hybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and
resource-constrained settings.

Method: 使用3D卷积神经网络训练R2*图像，通过LRP生成热图，并用谱聚类和t-SNE可视化分析决策模式。

Result: 谱聚类揭示了不同决策模式，其中基于相关性的模型在AD和NC间分离最清晰。

Conclusion: 预处理和训练选择对模型策略影响显著，谱聚类为分析分类策略差异提供了结构化方法，强调医学AI中可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in classifying Alzheimer's
disease (AD) from R2* maps, but their decision-making remains opaque, raising
concerns about interpretability. Previous studies suggest biases in model
decisions, necessitating further analysis. This study uses Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP) and spectral clustering to explore classifier decision
strategies across preprocessing and training configurations using R2* maps. We
trained a 3D convolutional neural network on R2* maps, generating relevance
heatmaps via LRP and applied spectral clustering to identify dominant patterns.
t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization was used to assess
clustering structure. Spectral clustering revealed distinct decision patterns,
with the relevance-guided model showing the clearest separation between AD and
normal control (NC) cases. The t-SNE visualization confirmed that this model
aligned heatmap groupings with the underlying subject groups. Our findings
highlight the significant impact of preprocessing and training choices on deep
learning models trained on R2* maps, even with similar performance metrics.
Spectral clustering offers a structured method to identify classification
strategy differences, emphasizing the importance of explainability in medical
AI.

Motivation: 冠状动脉钙化的偶然检测和量化可能带来早期临床干预，但过度报告可能对患者健康和医疗系统造成负担，因此需要谨慎自动报告钙化分数。

Method: 提出了一种基于聚类的条件共形预测框架，用于校准3D UNet模型（确定性、MCDropout和深度集成）的预测区间。

Result: 该方法在覆盖率和分流指标上优于传统共形预测，能够提供有意义的钙化分数预测区间。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于根据风险类别预测的置信度对患者进行分流，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Incidental detection and quantification of coronary calcium in CT scans could
lead to the early introduction of lifesaving clinical interventions. However,
over-reporting could negatively affect patient wellbeing and unnecessarily
burden the medical system. Therefore, careful considerations should be taken
when automatically reporting coronary calcium scores. A cluster-based
conditional conformal prediction framework is proposed to provide score
intervals with calibrated coverage from trained segmentation networks without
retraining. The proposed method was tuned and used to calibrate predictive
intervals for 3D UNet models (deterministic, MCDropout and deep ensemble)
reaching similar coverage with better triage metrics compared to conventional
conformal prediction. Meaningful predictive intervals of calcium scores could
help triage patients according to the confidence of their risk category
prediction.

Motivation: 确保医学影像模型与临床知识对齐并具有可解释性。

Method: 使用简单的重建自编码器，将用户定义的概念与图像级特征关联，提取稳定的概念激活向量。

Result: 在胸部X光片中，对大病理（如心脏肥大）效果显著，但对小病理因重建限制仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于临床知识的可解释性提供了一条路径，尽管未超越基线，但具有潜力。

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment
with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical
concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link
user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training.
The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations
that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along
concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce
specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise
for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain
challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines,
this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations

Result: 在ACDC和膝关节数据集上验证，TSSC-Net实现了6倍时间超分辨率，保持结构保真度。

Conclusion: TSSC-Net有效提升动态MRI的时空一致性，适用于快速运动场景。

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the
trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time
that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude
motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based
interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle
with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and
diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving
spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our
diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames
using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal
super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel
tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual
information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from
cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting
cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC
cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results
demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from
fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership
has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like
violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by
embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior

visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a
novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder
for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for
inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over
unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了动态不确定性感知学习（DUAL）框架，有效处理单模态和多模态场景中的特征不确定性，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在多模态场景中面临特征不确定性问题，影响性能和可靠性。

Method: DUAL框架包含动态特征不确定性建模、自适应分布感知调制和不确定性感知跨模态关系学习。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，如CIFAR-10提升7.1%，CMU-MOSEI提升4.1%。

Conclusion: DUAL框架能有效解决特征不确定性，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse
learning scenarios, significantly impacting their performance and reliability.
This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models
must integrate information from different sources with inherent uncertainties.
We propose Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL), a unified framework that
effectively handles feature uncertainty in both single-modal and multi-modal
scenarios. DUAL introduces three key innovations: Dynamic Feature Uncertainty
Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint
consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive
Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions
through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal
Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal
interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's
effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves
substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on
CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it
demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy
on CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements
on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings.
This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the
pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language
models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image
encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this
work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient
adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to
large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial
accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided
by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we
can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our
robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under
adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text
encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via
direct optimization.

TL;DR: Dual-Arch框架通过结合深度和宽度网络的优势，解决了持续学习中的稳定性与可塑性冲突，提升了性能并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要平衡稳定性与可塑性，现有方法多关注参数层面，忽视了网络架构的影响。

Method: 提出Dual-Arch框架，包含两个独立网络：一个专注于可塑性（深度网络），一个专注于稳定性（宽度网络）。

Result: 实验表明，Dual-Arch提升了现有持续学习方法的性能，同时参数数量减少了87%。

Conclusion: Dual-Arch通过架构层面的优化，有效解决了持续学习中的稳定性与可塑性冲突。

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with
the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance
between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and
acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this
trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability
and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this
paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the
architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper
networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by
superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a
novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL.
This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and
independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability.
Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture,
tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87%
more compact in terms of parameters.

Motivation: 预训练模型在持续学习中通常冻结主干以保持稳定性，但限制了可塑性，尤其是在面对显著领域差距时。

Method: 提出ACL框架，在核心持续学习过程前加入适应性调整阶段，通过调整嵌入空间来平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Result: 实验表明ACL显著提升了持续学习性能，适用于多种基准和方法。

Conclusion: ACL为基于预训练模型的持续学习提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally
acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge
(stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL,
prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting
their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in
incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks
catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical
stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting
PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM
backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task
with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by
aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them
from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves
CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile
solution for PTM-based CL.

Conclusion: 新算法避免了启发式近似，提升了后验采样的准确性，适用于复杂贝叶斯逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling
high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for
representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However,
current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs
rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the
generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we
propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without
the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing
works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process
encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding
posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a
reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle
methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior
distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained
score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we
validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our
method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了数据分布差异，提升了联邦学习的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing
local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability.
The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset
imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the
labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models
with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model
aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of
the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal
Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing
the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish
this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise
averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where
they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset
towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a
global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of
variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed
approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching
higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical
inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality
textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where
tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular
reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information
available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured
information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring
structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address
these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a
new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured
tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator
based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On
this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous
reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo}
achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across
multiple datasets.

TL;DR: ReVisual-R1通过改进多模态大语言模型的训练流程，包括冷启动初始化、解决梯度停滞问题以及分阶段训练，显著提升了复杂推理能力，成为开源7B MLLM的新标杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接应用强化学习（RL）于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）时，难以激活复杂推理能力，因此需要深入分析训练流程中的关键问题。

Method: 1) 使用精选文本数据进行冷启动初始化；2) 解决标准GRPO在多模态RL中的梯度停滞问题；3) 分阶段训练（先多模态RL，后纯文本RL）。

Result: ReVisual-R1在多个挑战性基准测试（如MathVerse、AIME2024等）中达到开源7B MLLM的最新最优性能。

Conclusion: 分阶段训练方法有效平衡了感知基础和认知推理的发展，结合对多模态RL问题的解决，显著提升了MLLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex
textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement
learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In
this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into
current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective
cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.
Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone
can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,
even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers
from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)
Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further
enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively
balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By
incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we
introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B
MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,
LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但目标是提升元数据的完整性和标准化。

Conclusion: 集成多种技术可以解决文化遗产数字化中的元数据问题。

Abstract: Digitizing cultural heritage collections has become crucial for preservation
of historical artifacts and enhancing their availability to the wider public.
Galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM institutions) are actively
digitizing their holdings and creates extensive digital collections. Those
collections are often enriched with metadata describing items but not exactly
their contents. The Jagiellonian Digital Library, standing as a good example of
such an effort, offers datasets accessible through protocols like OAI-PMH.
Despite these improvements, metadata completeness and standardization continue
to pose substantial obstacles, limiting the searchability and potential
connections between collections. To deal with these challenges, we explore an
integrated methodology of computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI),
and semantic web technologies to enrich metadata and construct knowledge graphs
for digitized manuscripts and incunabula.

*Lukas Meyer,Josef Grün,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MS-Splatting是一种多光谱3D高斯泼溅框架，无需跨模态相机标定，能生成多视角一致的新视图，适用于多种光谱（如热红外和近红外）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用光谱和空间相关性，且需要跨模态相机标定。

Method: 提出一种神经颜色表示法，将多光谱信息编码为紧凑的每泼溅特征嵌入，并通过浅层MLP解码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了多光谱渲染质量，并在农业应用中成功渲染植被指数（如NDVI）。

Conclusion: MS-Splatting是一种简单有效的多光谱渲染方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from
images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In
contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera
calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra,
including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by
optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the
underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel
neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a
learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling
joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to
improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved
per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render
vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著缩小了低成本与工作室录制之间的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为日常用户提供了高质量的数字克隆解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing facial appearance capture methods can reconstruct plausible facial
reflectance from smartphone-recorded videos. However, the reconstruction
quality is still far behind the ones based on studio recordings. This paper
fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located
smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the
quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the
data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a
diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the
reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the
diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and
training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high
resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a
patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution
reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate
our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a
large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the
digital world. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yxuhan/DoRA.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial
for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing
methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly
annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and
rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a
self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from
two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states,
enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and
articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter
per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization
strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation,
and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy.
SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging
scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors.
Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with
applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate
SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical
limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns
and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face
insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while
being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook
compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel
paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real
datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic
observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key
idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by
generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and
speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations
that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based
weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of
causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential
interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated
with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop
approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to
benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 物体中心3D运动场是一种有效的动作表示方法，能够显著提升机器人从人类视频中学习控制策略的性能。

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction
for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or
action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key
challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and
pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss
of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field
to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel
framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control.
We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel
training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to
extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly.
Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that
favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background.
We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method
reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method,
achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches
fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills
like insertion.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and
accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22
official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most
of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on
zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics
come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of
a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the
phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and
enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频建模方法（如LLava）在处理长视频时会产生大量视觉令牌，导致计算负担过重。

Method: DynTok将视觉令牌自适应分组并合并，在高信息密度区域保留关键内容，低密度区域实现高压缩。

Result: 令牌数量减少至原始大小的44.4%，性能相当；在Video-MME和MLVU上分别达到65.3%和72.5%。

Conclusion: DynTok揭示了视频令牌表示的冗余性，为设计更高效的视频建模技术提供了思路。

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences
of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective
video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual
tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract
relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it
into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work,
we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression
strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them
within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information
density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of
tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance.
It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves
65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective
compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and
offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了单模态学习的潜力以及多模态的互补性，为模型设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor
experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper,
we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of
data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a
ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing
tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We
evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as
multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an
extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset
of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly
outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform
comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are
classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights
into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity
of the modalities.

Conclusion: RAG技术显著提升了LVLMs的性能，无需微调即可实现效果提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and
complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data,
susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against
up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic
real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a
practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access
large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding
model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this
paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG
pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the
modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on
strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved
evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best
integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we
extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and
generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence
and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG
for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance
boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group
(RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively
"dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This
task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached
probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct
scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We
demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters
can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior
of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder
ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated
configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but
also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly,
we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers
offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules,
akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the
universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative
models of statistical ensembles in physics.

cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for
dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a
spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural
displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors
and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to
reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's
efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using
millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a
programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude
improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules,
establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures.
Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and
data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with
potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and
autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and
high-throughput are critical.

Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires
accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target
audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods
often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research
introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location
visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced
from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver
field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle
position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with
building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the
cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential
points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is
highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive
disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core
technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index
over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity)
radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of
millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly
outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings:
1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots'
receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2)
The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal
distribution.
