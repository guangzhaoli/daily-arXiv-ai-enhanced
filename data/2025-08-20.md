### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR是一种轻量高效的实时疲劳检测模型，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳检测对智能交通系统至关重要，但现有方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或鲁棒性不足等问题。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，结合CAFM（卷积与注意力融合模块）和RCM（矩形校准模块）增强特征表达和定位能力。

Result: 在DSM数据集上，精度87.17%，召回率83.86%，mAP@50为88.09%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了高效实用的解决方案，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于检测真实场景中的AI生成图像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像（AIGI）的传播威胁信息安全和公众信任，现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建Mirage基准，提出Mirage-R1模型，结合启发式到分析推理和强化学习。

Result: Mirage-R1在Mirage和公共基准上分别领先现有方法5%和10%。

Conclusion: Mirage-R1有效平衡推理速度和性能，适用于真实场景的AIGI检测。

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的框架，通过结合推理和工具交替的视觉语言模型（VLMs）来解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在OCR任务中的幻觉问题和性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在OCR任务中存在幻觉问题（生成不存在的文本）且性能不如专业模型，需要一种方法来结合两者的优势。

Method: DianJin-OCR-R1通过自身OCR能力识别图像内容，调用专业工具获取参考结果，再重新推理生成最终识别内容。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1优于非推理模型和专业OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了VLMs和专业模型的优势，提升了OCR任务的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

### [4] [Exploration of Deep Learning Based Recognition for Urdu Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13245)
*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过自动特征学习技术处理乌尔都语的复杂几何和形态结构，成功实现了高精度的组件分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语因其复杂的几何和形态结构难以分类，传统的基于分割的识别方法错误率高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行自动特征学习，通过连接组件技术生成乌尔都语文本数据集，并实现分层神经网络处理字符排列和组件分类。

Result: 模型在组件分类上达到了0.99%的高精度。

Conclusion: 提出的组件分类方法在乌尔都语字符识别中表现优异，为类似语言的识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过考虑标签可靠性和有序结构，提高了溃疡性结肠炎内窥镜图像分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内窥镜评分（MES）分类由于观察者间的标签噪声和有序性，标准模型难以处理。

Method: 使用图像质量作为标签置信度的代理，结合ResizeMix增强，设计了一个从易到难的课程学习框架。

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升了性能，如ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK。

Conclusion: CLoE展示了在标签不确定性下，难度感知训练策略对有序分类的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的框架，用于合成逼真的步态轮廓序列，解决了步态识别中数据不足和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别缺乏大规模标注数据集，且收集多样化的步态样本时隐私难以保障。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，生成时间一致且保留身份的步态序列，并可控制生成条件（如衣物、视角等）。

Result: 合成样本提升了步态识别性能，尤其在挑战性条件下；还能生成新身份以保护隐私。

Conclusion: GaitCrafter为高质量、可控且隐私友好的步态数据生成提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶中多视角视觉语言模型的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过多样性感知令牌选择和视图自适应剪枝控制器，显著提升了计算效率和内存使用，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率、多视角图像时面临计算开销大和内存消耗高的问题，这源于视觉令牌编码的二次复杂度。

Method: Prune2Drive提出了一种多样性感知令牌选择机制和视图自适应剪枝控制器，无需模型重新训练或访问注意力图。

Result: 在DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1基准测试中，Prune2Drive在仅保留10%视觉令牌的情况下，实现了6.40倍的预填充加速和13.4%的原始FLOPs消耗，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive是一种高效且兼容性强的视觉令牌剪枝框架，显著提升了多视角视觉语言模型的计算效率，适用于自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一种可微分的元攻击框架，通过组合现有Lp攻击方法生成感知对齐的对抗样本，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Lp范数约束的对抗样本与人类感知不一致，且缺乏对感知对齐攻击的探索。

Method: DAASH采用多阶段策略，动态聚合多个基础攻击的候选样本，并通过元损失函数联合优化分类错误和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet上，DAASH攻击成功率和视觉质量显著优于现有方法（如AdvAD）。

Conclusion: DAASH是一种实用且强大的基准方法，无需针对新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展、可解释的计算机视觉框架，用于通过正面照片量化面部整形手术的美学效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化面部整形手术的美学效果，为手术规划、患者咨询和客观结果评估提供数据支持。

Method: 利用自动标志点检测、几何面部对称性计算、基于深度学习的年龄估计和鼻形态分析。

Result: 在鼻整形手术中，96.2%的患者至少一项鼻部测量指标显著改善；在更广泛的正面照片队列中，71.3%的患者面部对称性或感知年龄显著改善。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据驱动的手术规划和结果评估提供了可重复的定量基准和新数据集。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限的医疗环境中存在计算成本高、可访问性低和数据隐私问题，因此研究SLMs的替代方案。

Method: 使用NIH Chest X-ray数据集，评估多种SLMs在胸部X光片位置分类任务中的表现，比较三种提示策略。

Result: 某些SLMs通过精心设计的提示达到与LLMs竞争的准确率，提示工程可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提示工程能有效提升SLMs在医疗应用中的表现，无需用户具备深度学习专业知识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选视觉问答基准中存在Easy-Options Bias（EOB）问题，提出GroundAttack工具生成难负选项以消除偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）仅通过视觉和选项即可选择正确答案，无需问题，揭示了视觉相关性不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出GroundAttack工具，自动生成视觉上可信的难负选项，用于创建无EOB的标注数据。

Result: 在无EOB的标注数据上，VLMs在仅视觉和选项输入下的准确率接近随机，在完整输入下的准确率也显著下降。

Conclusion: GroundAttack有效消除了EOB偏差，提供了更真实的VLMs问答能力评估。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化提示和知识蒸馏的框架VISTA，用于高效理解交通场景和风险评估，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂动态环境中难以扩展和泛化，需提升智能交通系统和自动驾驶的场景理解能力。

Method: 结合GPT-4o和o3-mini两个大型视觉语言模型，通过结构化思维链策略生成高质量伪标注，用于训练轻量级学生模型VISTA。

Result: VISTA在低分辨率视频中表现优异，性能接近教师模型，且参数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体监督和知识蒸馏可赋能轻量模型，实现高效实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和预防复发至关重要，但CNN在长距离依赖捕捉上有限。

Method: 使用ViT和ResNet50在两种外植数据集（CCD相机和输尿管镜图像）上进行对比分析。

Result: ViT在复杂子集（内窥镜图像）中准确率达95.2%，F1分数95.1%，显著优于ResNet50的64.5%和59.3%。

Conclusion: ViT在肾结石图像分类中表现优于CNN，提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多图像，节省60%参数并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR为每张图像单独训练MLP导致计算和存储效率低下。

Method: 共享中间层并设计输入特定的投影层。

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中节省60%参数，PSNR保持34 dB。

Conclusion: MINR在多图像处理中高效且鲁棒。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种新型的分布感知Hadamard量化方案，针对INRs中的权重和激活进行量化，显著降低硬件开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs依赖全精度数字表示，导致硬件开销大，现有量化方法仅关注权重量化，硬件节省有限。

Method: 利用Hadamard变换将权重和激活的多样化分布标准化为统一钟形，再应用标准量化器。

Result: DHQ在图像重建任务中优于现有量化方法，延迟降低32.7%，能耗减少40.1%，资源利用率降低98.3%。

Conclusion: DHQ通过标准化分布和量化，显著提升硬件效率，适用于INRs的量化需求。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了INRs的鲁棒性，适用于噪声环境下的多媒体应用。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Motivation: 微表情持续时间短、强度低，现有方法难以有效提取其细粒度和时空特征。

Method: 结合2D CNN AMNet2D和3D CNN AMNet3D，采用多任务学习（MER和FAUD）和参数硬共享策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如SAMM（UAR 83.75%）、CASME II（UF1 84.03%）和CAS(ME)^3（UAR 51%）。

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和分层注意力机制，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Result: 在Dual-Radar数据集上验证了CORENet的有效性，检测鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: CORENet在噪声环境下优于主流方法，且仅需训练时使用LiDAR数据，推理时完全依赖雷达。

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过增强特征和聚类空间的可区分性，显著提升了多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE，结合运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图进行训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够自适应选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列，优于传统解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的标记器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征（如纹理和颜色），而忽略了几何结构。VGQ旨在通过直接建模结构相关参数（如位置、旋转和尺度）来解决这一问题。

Method: VGQ将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，通过增加高斯密度来提升重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ实现了rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的优异表现，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过增强结构建模能力，在图像重建任务中取得了显著进步，为视觉编码提供了新的范式。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的头像重建框架EAvatar，解决了现有方法在捕捉细微表情和保持局部纹理连续性上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真头像重建在AR/VR、游戏和多媒体内容创作中至关重要，但现有3DGS方法在复杂表情和纹理连续性上表现不足。

Method: 引入稀疏表情控制机制，利用关键高斯点影响邻近高斯点的变形，并结合预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验。

Result: 实验表明，EAvatar能更准确地重建头像，提升表情可控性和细节保真度。

Conclusion: EAvatar在头像重建中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

*Sukhun Ko,Dahyeon Kye,Kyle Min,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR是一种新型的隐式神经表示方法，通过频率选择和空间定位改进现有INRs的局限性，显著提升了2D图像和3D重建的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INRs缺乏频率选择性、空间定位和稀疏表示，导致对冗余信号成分的过度依赖和频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含RC-GAUSS激活函数（用于频率选择和空间定位）和WEGE编码（利用DWT计算能量分数并引导频率信息）。

Result: 在2D图像表示与修复以及3D重建任务中，FLAIR均优于现有INRs。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率和局部感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: GazeProphet是一种纯软件方法，用于预测VR环境中的注视位置，无需专用硬件，显著降低了计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于硬件的眼动追踪系统成本高且复杂，限制了广泛应用。

Method: 结合球形视觉Transformer和LSTM时序编码器，通过多模态融合网络预测未来注视位置。

Result: 在VR数据集上，GazeProphet的中值角度误差为3.83度，优于传统方法24%。

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，提升性能且无需额外硬件。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

*Zihan Zhang,Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量化的GFVC框架，通过双模式优化（架构重设计和操作优化）降低复杂度，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GFVC因大模型参数和高计算成本而难以实际部署的问题。

Method: 采用双模式优化：架构上替换传统卷积层为更高效的层；操作上开发两阶段自适应通道剪枝策略。

Result: 实现了90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，性能优于VVC。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境中高效部署GFVC。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物神经元原理的编码方法，增强SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN性能落后于CNN的问题，同时保持神经形态计算的初衷。

Method: 采用类似神经元的编码方法，并结合人工光感受器层生成视觉脉冲信号。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效增加了脉冲信号的信息量并提升了SNN性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力推动神经形态计算的发展，扩展SNN的应用范围。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一种无需目标数据重新训练的新框架，通过自监督学习将字典查找能力迁移到FSAS任务中，用于检测未见类别的视觉异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在FSAS任务中的跨类别泛化能力依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，而DictAS旨在通过自监督学习实现无需目标数据重新训练的异常检测。

Method: DictAS包含三个主要组件：字典构建（模拟真实字典的索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征）、查询判别正则化（增强异常特征的判别能力）。

Result: 在七个公共工业和医学数据集上的实验表明，DictAS始终优于最先进的FSAS方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督学习和字典查找机制，实现了对未见类别视觉异常的高效检测，无需目标数据重新训练。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify 是一种神经框架，通过单次回归模型替代 SMPLify 的迭代优化过程，显著提升运行速度，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify 的计算成本高，限制了其实用性。受数据驱动神经网络替代迭代优化的趋势启发，提出了 Learnable SMPLify。

Method: 采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对，并提出人中心归一化方案和残差学习以缩小解空间。

Result: Learnable SMPLify 运行速度比 SMPLify 快近 200 倍，在 3DPW 和 RICH 上泛化良好，并可作为插件工具。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify 是一种实用且简单的基线方法，适用于序列推理和插件后处理。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用特征语义，提升了视频动作分析的精度和可扩展性，适用于高性能物联网应用。

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: 在四个公开RVOS基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 改进分割头和简化模型设计能显著提升RVOS性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、基于GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法，并利用现有DA GAN扩展支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像进行训练。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，语义分割性能整体提升1.85%，夜间条件下提升4.62%。

Conclusion: 混合方法在恶劣条件下显著提升了自动驾驶感知的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Method: 提出双解耦框架，包括源级和路径级解耦，结合混合视图变换和轴感知融合模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上取得最佳性能，分别提升0.23 mIoU和2.03 IoU。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过解耦设计和创新模块，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的效果。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有训练数据在规模、质量和多样性上的不足导致模型无法泛化到全人类多样性。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型表现优于其他数据集训练的模型，且TalkVid-Bench揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid和TalkVid-Bench为未来研究提供了必要的数据和评估工具。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计方法，通过基于transformer的网络和几何特征引导算法实现高效准确的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RGB-D方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中表现不佳，因此需要一种仅依赖RGB图像的解决方案。

Method: 设计了基于transformer的神经网络，结合几何特征引导算法和RANSAC-PnP算法进行姿态估计。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出高效性和高精度，优于现有RGB方法。

Conclusion: 为仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现训练与推理阶段的差距导致条件生成性能下降，且生成质量对引导权重高度敏感。

Method: 提出DiffIER，一种基于优化的方法，通过迭代最小化推理阶段的误差来减少累积误差。

Result: 实验表明DiffIER在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，并在多领域应用中表现一致。

Conclusion: DiffIER是一种通用且高效的优化框架，有望在未来的广泛研究中应用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术主要关注服装，而OmniTry旨在扩展到任何可穿戴物品（如珠宝和配饰），并解决数据配对的挑战。

Conclusion: OmniTry为虚拟试穿提供了更通用的解决方案，适用于多种可穿戴物品，且性能优越。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Method: 通过解耦任务为候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展，实现动态顶点（边）插入。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中表现优于现有方法，速度更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: DeH4R在拓扑保真度和空间一致性方面表现出色，同时保持快速推理速度。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCMamba的新型半监督医学图像分割框架，通过数据、网络和特征多样性增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据获取成本高且耗时，半监督技术可利用未标注数据生成伪标签，而Mamba等状态空间模型能高效处理长程依赖关系。

Method: DCMamba框架结合了数据层面的弱-强混合增强、网络层面的多样扫描协作模块和特征层面的不确定性加权对比学习机制。

Result: 实验表明，DCMamba在20%标注数据的Synapse数据集上比其他方法性能提升6.69%。

Conclusion: DCMamba通过多样性增强在半监督医学图像分割中表现出色，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了农业主题虚拟博物馆的检索问题，并通过实验验证了其设计选择的合理性。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

TL;DR: IPGA是一种针对视觉语言模型的新型对抗攻击方法，通过攻击投影模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）实现更精细的扰动控制，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型中仅关注全局相似性，忽略了投影模块的关键作用，导致攻击粒度不足和效果受限。

Method: IPGA利用Q-Former的中间阶段生成细粒度视觉特征，结合Residual Query Alignment（RQA）保留无关内容，实现精确攻击。

Result: IPGA在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中表现优于现有方法，并能迁移到商业模型如Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影模块中间阶段，显著提升了对抗攻击的精细度和有效性，为视觉语言模型的安全性评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码和噪声抑制解决多图像输入中的信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多图像输入时性能显著下降，原因是不同图像的视觉线索在输出中纠缠（交叉图像信息泄漏）。

Method: 提出FOCUS策略：顺序掩码所有图像（仅保留一张干净图像），重复此过程并聚合结果，最后通过噪声参考输入对比优化。

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM家族中均提升了性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS为增强多图像推理提供了一种通用且无需额外训练或架构修改的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Conclusion: MR6D为移动机器人姿态估计方法的开发和评估提供了基础，填补了现有数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了方法的准确性，展示了多相机系统下SfT的优越性。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了广义相机模型下的SfT解决方案，通过多相机约束提高了配准精度，为相关领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Conclusion: VisionLaw成功地从视觉观察中推断出可解释的内在动力学，为交互式模拟提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，结合临床文本增强模型的可信度。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT和Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码的临床文本，通过跨模态注意力机制生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上，Dice分数达99%，IoU达95%，优于U-Net、ViT和Swin基线模型。临床文本显著提升分割和解释质量。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为多模态医学架构设定了新标准，提升了分割性能和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的新型攻击框架，显著降低了SNN的攻击延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的攻击方法在SNN中存在高延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: TCA包含两个组件：TLBP（基于时间步的反向传播）和A-MPR（对抗性膜电位重用）。

Result: 实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少了56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟。

Conclusion: TCA在保持攻击成功率的同时，显著提升了攻击效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Diaa Addeen Abuhani,Marco Seccaroni,Martina Mazzarello,Imran Zualkernan,Fabio Duarte,Carlo Ratti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督聚类框架，结合街景图像和空间种植模式，无需标签即可估算城市树木生物多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候韧性、生态稳定性和宜居性至关重要，但大多数城市缺乏详细的树冠数据。传统方法成本高且耗时，而监督AI方法需要标签数据且难以跨区域泛化。

Method: 通过无监督聚类框架，整合街景图像的视觉嵌入和空间种植模式，估算生物多样性。

Result: 在北美八个城市中，该方法能够高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，与真实数据的Wasserstein距离较低，并保留了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏详细数据的城市提供了可扩展、细粒度的生物多样性映射途径，支持低成本持续监测，促进绿化公平和城市生态系统适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自感知自适应对齐方法（SA3），用于跨域智能交通检测，通过高效的注意力机制和识别策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域场景下智能交通检测的挑战，提升检测性能。

Method: 采用基于注意力的对齐模块和实例到图像级别的对齐模块，实现源域和目标域的自适应对齐。

Result: 在流行的跨域目标检测基准测试中，SA3优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SA3通过自适应对齐机制显著提升了跨域检测性能。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过建模信号分量来提升文本到图像生成的精确对齐，避免关键元素缺失或概念混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在精确对齐文本提示时表现不佳，常遗漏关键元素或混淆不同概念。

Method: 学习基于目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，支持额外条件模态（如边界框）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进方法，且无需训练，兼容现有扩散和流匹配架构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过精细控制生成过程，显著提升了文本到图像生成的对齐效果。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The
code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.

Motivation: 传统石材劣化识别方法依赖专家团队直接观察，虽然准确但耗时耗资源。

Method: 系统采用认知架构，协调五个专业AI智能体（岩性学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师和诊断协调员）进行自动化诊断。

Result: 在28张复杂图像上的测试显示，系统在所有指标上均显著优于基础模型。

Conclusion: 该系统为石材劣化诊断提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个真实增量学习基准（RICO），用于评估增量学习在复杂现实场景中的表现，发现现有方法在适应性和知识保留上表现不佳，少量数据回放已优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多基于简化合成数据，无法反映真实场景中的挑战，因此需要更真实的基准。

Method: 引入两个基准：D-RICO（固定类别但领域变化）和EC-RICO（新增领域和类别），基于14个多样化数据集构建。

Result: 实验显示现有方法在适应性和知识保留上表现不佳，少量数据回放优于现有方法，但单独训练仍最优。

Conclusion: 增量学习方法的性能差距可能源于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示（LCRs）引导模型学习语义基础的特征，提高医学影像模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的深度学习模型常依赖虚假相关性而非临床相关特征，导致在分布偏移下泛化能力差。

Method: 通过小规模辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取LCRs，并引入正则化项引导CNN激活相关概念子空间。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中，LCRReg显著提升对虚假相关性的鲁棒性和OOD泛化能力。

Conclusion: LCRReg是一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念标注即可提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚雾霾对印度-恒河平原造成严重影响，但缺乏实时预测系统，因此研究旨在开发有效的预测方法。

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P气溶胶数据（2019-2023）和ConvLSTM神经网络，以紫外气溶胶指数为预测指标。

Result: 模型在五天内预测气溶胶指数的均方误差为0.0018，损失为0.3995，结构相似性指数为0.74。

Conclusion: 模型预测效果良好，但可通过整合更多数据和优化架构进一步提升。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法忽视长距离依赖，Transformer方法忽略局部上下文信息，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，SCRNet在医学超声图像分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCRNet通过结合卷积和交叉注意力机制，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PhysGM克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了高效且逼真的物理模拟和渲染。

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，无需重新训练即可适应多样光照条件。

Conclusion: DIME-Net具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力，适用于复杂光照环境。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Result: 在多个基准测试和FR模型中，ViT-FIQA表现优异，证明了ViT在FIQA中的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA展示了基于Transformer的架构在FIQA中的潜力，为未来研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在识别图像旋转角度（0°、90°、180°、270°）方面的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，尤其是区分90°和270°旋转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLMs在视觉推理和空间关系理解方面的能力，揭示其与人类感知的差距。

Method: 使用RotBench（350张手动筛选的图像）测试多种MLLMs，并尝试辅助信息、链式思维提示等方法。

Result: 模型能识别0°和180°旋转，但无法区分90°和270°；辅助信息和微调效果有限。

Conclusion: MLLMs在空间推理能力上存在显著不足，需进一步改进以接近人类水平。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become
increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has
motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still

<details>

Motivation: 在城市之外的高速公路上，自动驾驶车辆需要更长的感知距离（至少250米）以确保安全驾驶，尤其是对于大型卡车。现有方法因计算和内存成本高而难以实现这一目标。

Method: 采用稀疏表示和高效的3D编码，结合多模态和时序特征，并引入自监督预训练方案，利用未标注的相机-LiDAR数据进行大规模学习。

Result: 感知距离扩展到250米，物体检测的mAP提高了26.6%，LiDAR预测的Chamfer Distance降低了30.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长距离感知的挑战，为自动驾驶在高速公路上的应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应视图选择和在线多视角立体技术，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅模型的完整性和一致性。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Noisy Alignment（NA）的方法，用于解决自监督对比学习中的数据中毒后门攻击问题。该方法通过显式抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分，显著提升了攻击效果，并保持了干净数据的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督对比学习（CL）在无标签数据上学习可迁移表示时容易受到数据中毒后门攻击（DPCLs）的影响。现有方法因依赖脆弱的隐式共现关系和对中毒图像中判别性特征的抑制不足而效果有限。

Method: Noisy Alignment方法通过策略性地操纵对比学习的随机裁剪机制，将过程建模为图像布局优化问题，并推导出理论上的最优参数。

Result: 实验表明，Noisy Alignment在攻击效果上达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了干净数据的准确性，并对常见的后门防御方法表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment是一种简单而有效的方法，显著提升了数据中毒后门攻击的效果，为自监督对比学习的安全性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Conclusion: InfiniteTalk通过稀疏帧视频配音和自适应条件设计，解决了传统方法的局限性，实现了高质量的音频驱动全身动画。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D有效提升了多种3D生成和重建方法生成的形状的细节质量。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational

designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing

handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained

detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing

information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and

The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf

Result: 实验证明ROVER在重复环境中有效减少误检，并集成到SLAM系统中验证其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: ROVER利用轨迹先验显著提升了闭环验证的准确性，适用于挑战性环境。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based

Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data

*Martijn Cramer,Yanming Wu,David De Schepper,Eric Demeester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在中小企业中通过集成3D物体识别和定位技术，将协作机器人（cobots）转变为移动和可重构生产助手的机遇与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高混合低批量生产，中小企业面临小批量订单和多样化需求的挑战，标准自动化解决方案不足，导致依赖重复性人工劳动，增加了成本且未能充分利用技术熟练劳动力。

Method: 通过集成现有技术（如3D物体识别和定位），将协作机器人转变为移动和可重构的生产助手。

Result: 论文概述了在工业环境中增强协作机器人系统的关键步骤，并通过与工业合作伙伴的实际项目案例提供了具体实施示例。

Conclusion: 通过技术集成，协作机器人可以成为解决中小企业生产挑战的有效工具，但仍需克服实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Image2Net的混合框架，用于将电路图转换为网表，并开源了一个包含丰富电路图风格的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟集成电路（IC）多以图像形式呈现，而大型语言模型（LLM）需要文本描述来丰富知识，因此需要高效的电路图到网表的转换方法。

Method: 构建了一个多样化的电路图数据集，并提出Image2Net框架，引入网表编辑距离（NED）作为评估指标。

Result: Image2Net的成功率为80.77%，比之前工作提高了34.62%-45.19%；平均NED为0.116，比现有技术低62.1%-69.6%。

Conclusion: Image2Net在电路图到网表转换任务中表现出色，为LLM在模拟IC设计中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 解决行人跟踪问题，探索标准点对象模型与数据之间的匹配性。

Method: 采用标准点对象模型和PMBM滤波器，结合第一原理和数据（MOT-17数据集）选择参数。

Result: PMBM算法显示出有希望的结果，但揭示了标准点对象模型与数据之间的不匹配。

Conclusion: 未来通过修改导致模型与数据不匹配的组件，可以开发出更好的基于模型的算法。

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

Motivation: 探索视觉问答任务中的图表问答子任务，验证跨模态模块的重要性。

Method: 开发了基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型，结合ResNet 101图像编码器和联合融合模块，与LSTM+CNN基线对比。

Result: 跨模态模块在图表问答中并非关键，模型表现未达预期。

Conclusion: 图表问答任务具有挑战性，需进一步研究适合的模型架构。

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

TL;DR: RISE框架通过两阶段方法提升视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力，无需人工标注的思维链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SFT和Visual-RFT）在复杂图像标注任务中表现不足，缺乏高质量思维链支持。

Method: RISE分为两阶段：RISE-CoT通过强化学习生成逻辑一致的思维链；RISE-R1利用高质量思维链进行监督和强化微调。

Result: RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B在复杂和简单任务中均优于SFT和Visual-RFT，性能更强且可解释性更高。

Conclusion: RISE为提升视觉语言模型推理能力提供了自监督解决方案，无需人工标注思维链。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层次多标签分类在多任务学习中面临结构一致性和损失平衡的挑战，需要一种能够保持语义一致性和动态优化资源的方法。

Method: HCAL结合原型对比学习和自适应任务加权机制，通过原型扰动和定量指标HVR增强鲁棒性和评估一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，HCAL在分类准确率和层次一致性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: HCAL通过语义一致性和自适应优化机制，有效解决了层次多标签分类中的关键问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Motivation: 现有评估框架（1998年的比较表）已无法反映生物识别技术的最新发展和漏洞，亟需更新。

Method: 通过24位生物识别专家的调查，重新评估各模态的属性评分，并与55个数据集的实证数据对比。

Result: 发现技术进步提升了面部识别的评分，而指纹识别的可靠性下降；专家评估与实证数据高度一致，但也揭示了关键挑战。

Conclusion: 专家评估与实证数据的结合对生物识别模态的评估至关重要，未来研究应解决专家分歧揭示的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调（SFT）方法在图表到代码生成任务中存在性能瓶颈，需要更有效的强化学习策略来优化结构化输出。

Method: 提出MSRL方法，结合文本和视觉反馈的多粒度奖励系统，包括基于规则的细粒度代码验证和基于模型的视觉结构相似性评估。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准上分别提升了6.2%和9.9%。

Conclusion: MSRL通过多模态结构化奖励系统有效解决了图表到代码生成任务中的性能瓶颈问题，性能接近闭源先进模型。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Abstract: Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making
that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under
high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to
assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into
measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for
visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated,
multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated
Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice
questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality
assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with
substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions
such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44%
in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5
attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing
threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5
delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o
in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving,
highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医生对医学AI的信任度低，主要源于其诊断不确定性，而AI缺乏足够的背景知识。

Method: 采用不确定性感知学习策略，结合医生的背景知识和病灶信息进行训练。

Result: 模型在敏感度上提升了10%，不确定性熵降低了0.2，性能达到92%（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2）。

Conclusion: 该策略有效减少了医学AI的诊断不确定性，提升了临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

Result: 分类模型在测试集上准确率92.31%，灵敏度98.24%，特异性88.37%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源环境下的自动化筛查提供了可行方案，具有高准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散MRI（dMRI）在脑微结构和连接性研究中很重要，但单次采集易受磁化率畸变影响，传统方法需双采集，限制了应用。

Method: 使用深度学习技术，仅需单次采集（blip-up或blip-down）即可校正磁化率畸变，无需成对数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与传统topup方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为dMRI磁化率畸变校正提供了一种高效实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Path-PKT，首次系统研究了病理学中的预后知识转移，通过多癌症数据集和实验设计，提出了一种新方法MoE-PKT，并验证了其在罕见肿瘤疾病中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSI预后研究采用癌症特异性模型，无法利用其他癌症的预后知识，且难以应对罕见肿瘤样本不足的问题。

Method: 研究包括三部分：构建多癌症数据集UNI2-h-DSS，实验分析知识转移影响因素，提出MoE-PKT方法。

Result: 验证了预后知识在不同癌症间的可转移性，并展示了MoE-PKT在罕见肿瘤中的有效性。

Conclusion: Path-PKT为WSI预后知识转移研究奠定了基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Motivation: 评估公开腹部CT数据集在AI临床应用中的适用性，以解决数据冗余和地理偏差问题。

Method: 分析了46个公开腹部CT数据集（50,256项研究），评估冗余性和地理分布，并对19个数据集进行偏差分析。

Result: 发现59.1%的数据冗余和75.3%的地理偏差（北美和欧洲），63%的领域偏移和57%的选择偏差。

Conclusion: 提出多机构合作、标准化协议和多样化患者纳入等策略，以提升AI模型的公平性和临床稳健性。

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医药领域的高通量筛选提供了一种高效、无需微调的分割解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our
codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Method: 采用数据驱动的扩散模型插值方案，在潜在空间操作以提高计算效率，仅需稀疏2D CMR图像输入。

Result: CaLID在重建质量和效率上优于基线方法，计算速度提升24倍，且无需辅助输入。

Conclusion: CaLID为心脏成像提供了高效、准确的解决方案，推动了3D心脏重建技术的发展。

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

Motivation: TCCD评估依赖操作者经验，限制了其广泛应用，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发了Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)网络，用于实时脑血管分割。

Result: AAW-YOLO在分割CoW血管时表现优异，Dice分数0.901，推理速度14.199 ms/帧。

Conclusion: 该系统有望在临床中减少对操作者经验的依赖，未来将探索更大规模验证。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale
validation.

Result: NeuSee能抑制高达$10^6$倍饱和阈值的激光辐照，图像恢复质量提升10.1%。

Conclusion: NeuSee首次实现全光谱成像和激光抑制，优于其他学习型DOE。

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum
imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in
restored image quality.

Conclusion: 相似性融合块和一热标签空间有效提升模型性能，解决了数据不一致问题。

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical
structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models
are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the
process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and
significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative
applications in orthopedics.

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，传统预训练方法难以适应多领域、多任务需求。

Method: 提出UNICON框架，通过统一且可扩展的方式，动态调整基础模型以适应新任务和模态。

Result: 实验表明，UNICON在分类、预后和分割任务中表现优异，PET扫描的Dice分数提高了5%。

Conclusion: 基础模型可通过持续学习扩展其初始训练范围，为医学影像通用AI模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Method: 引入了MM-BrowseComp，包含224个手工制作的问题，这些问题结合了图像和视频，并提供了验证清单以分析多模态依赖性和推理路径。

Result: 评估显示，即使是顶级模型（如OpenAI o3）在多模态任务上的准确率仅为29.02%，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

Conclusion: MME-SCI通过多语言和细粒度知识属性，深入分析了模型性能，并揭示了其在特定领域的弱点。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Motivation: 传统方法在从RGB-D序列重建场景表面时存在性能不足的问题，PreSem-Surf旨在通过多模态信息融合提升重建效果。

Method: 采用SG-MLP采样结构和PR-MLP进行体素预渲染，结合渐进式语义建模提取多精度语义信息。

Result: 在七个合成场景的实验中，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU上表现最佳，其他指标也保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf在高效性和实用性上表现出色，适用于高质量场景重建。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.
