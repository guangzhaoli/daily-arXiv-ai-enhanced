### [1] [Artificial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Care: Transforming Preoperative Planning and Patient Education with 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12242)
*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于人机协作的U-Mamba机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割和重建算法的泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割精度，并显著提升了临床规划和患者教育效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割算法在多样化数据集上泛化能力不足，需要开发能够跨数据集泛化的准确3D解剖重建算法来支持精准的术前规划。

Method: 采用人机协作方法，处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，包括匿名化、手动分割T1加权和动态增强序列、配准分割整个乳腺、纤维腺组织和肿瘤，使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化，并通过U-Mamba模型优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba在T1加权图像上表现出色：整体器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12，生成准确的3D重建模型，临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持。

Conclusion: 这种人机协作的机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过3D可视化提升了患者教育和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络(CNN)自动分割TRISO颗粒的微观截面图像，以替代人工分析，提高效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRISO颗粒燃料在辐照后会产生形态变化，传统人工分析方法繁琐且主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效自动化TRISO颗粒的微观图像分割，减少人工劳动并提高分析结果的客观性

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出分层管道用于作物异常检测和状态估计，结合自编码器、机器学习和深度学习，实现高效养分管理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法分析时间长，无法实时优化；成像技术计算量大，难以在资源受限环境下部署

Method: 使用多光谱成像，构建分层管道：自编码器用于异常检测，植被指数+随机森林和原始图像+视觉变换器用于状态估计

Result: 异常检测效率高（移植后9天检测73% T3样本），能耗低于浪费氮的隐含能量；ViT在磷和钙估计上优于RF但能耗更高

Conclusion: 模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个带注释多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型的幽默理解和叙事序列识别能力，实验显示当前模型表现远低于人类水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解幽默是社交智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战，需要开发更好的评估框架

Method: 构建包含2800个标注多格漫画的PixelHumor基准数据集，对最先进的LMMs进行实验评估，包括面板排序等任务

Result: 实验结果显示当前模型存在显著差距：顶级模型在面板排序任务中仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现，表明模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在关键限制

Conclusion: PixelHumor通过提供评估多模态上下文和叙事推理的严格框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社交意识交互的LMMs

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线人-物交互（HOI）生成与感知任务，并基于Mamba框架构建OnlineHOI网络，在流式数据场景下实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI方法基于离线设置，无法处理现实世界中的在线场景，即每个时间步只能获取当前和历史信息

Method: 基于Mamba框架构建OnlineHOI网络架构，采用记忆机制有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba强大的流式数据建模能力

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及HOI4D在线感知任务上取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 在线HOI任务具有重要意义，提出的OnlineHOI框架通过结合Mamba和记忆机制，成功解决了离线方法在在线场景下的性能瓶颈

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度学习技术发展带来了Deepfake技术的进步，这对社会产生了复杂影响，既有利也有弊，特别是在隐私、名人声誉和国家安全方面存在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析深度学习技术在日常生活中的应用及其带来的双重影响，特别是Deepfake技术对社会各个层面的潜在危害。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析深度学习技术发展，探讨Deepfake技术在面部识别、信息篡改和政治操纵等方面的具体应用方式和风险。

Result: Deepfake技术能够生成难以区分的伪造图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统功能，并被滥用于误导用户、操纵选举和破坏政治经济结构。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术的快速发展带来了Deepfake等技术的双重影响，需要社会各界关注其潜在风险并采取相应防范措施。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型的简单性偏差(SB)与图像分类任务性能之间的关系，提出了新的频率感知测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能的相关性存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏差(SB)影响泛化能力，但过度SB可能损害复杂任务性能。现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量方法及其在不同图像分类任务中影响的研究。

Method: 1. 理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2. 提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3. 在CLIP模型上验证新方法，并应用两种SB调制方法；4. 研究SB与各种图像分类任务性能的关系，包括零样本和微调设置。

Result: 1. 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；2. SB强度与性能关系因任务而异：更强的SB与更好的OOD泛化性能正相关，但与对抗鲁棒性的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏差与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB的适当程度应根据具体任务需求进行调整，不同任务对SB的需求存在差异。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于图神经网络的多类别皮肤镜分类框架，首次在ISIC规模上整合图像、毫米级校准和元数据，显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的仅基于图像的AI方法往往忽略患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而这些信息对于皮肤镜图像的几何分析至关重要。

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过轻量级1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征和元数据相似性的图结构，采用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类。

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice得分分别为0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型达到AUC 0.9812，稀疏版本使用约25%边仍保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于仅图像基线的0.9440。

Conclusion: 整合校准尺度、病变几何和元数据的群体图方法在ISIC-2019上相比仅图像流程有显著提升，稀疏图能保持近乎最优精度，尺度感知的图基AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向。

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TIMT研究主要关注图像中所有文本的翻译，忽视了边界框定位和有限场景覆盖，需要支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译任务。

Method: 提出了自适应图像OCR精炼管道，根据场景自适应选择OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的结果；构建了包含1200个高质量实例的测试集；使用紧凑大型视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 经过数据微调后，紧凑型LVLMs在两个子任务上均达到最先进性能，实验结果表明训练数据具有良好的可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的方法和基准数据集有效解决了细粒度位置感知翻译问题，为相关研究提供了可靠评估框架。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架，通过相似性引导和记忆引导的域适应方法，解决光学图像到SAR图像的跨模态船迹检测问题，提高检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的船迹特征抽象且噪声多，标注困难；光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，直接迁移会导致性能下降。

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制筛选源样本，建立特征-置信度记忆库动态校准目标域伪标签，结合区域混合训练增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态船迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的跨模态域适应挑战，验证了所提方法的有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动、物理引导的深度学习方法，用于生成美国本土2公里分辨率的小时级气温数据，通过神经网络重建被云遮挡的卫星地表温度数据并转换为气温，准确率达到1.93°C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象站提供连续监测但空间覆盖有限，卫星提供广域覆盖但无法提供无缝的时空数据，需要一种能够结合两者优势的高分辨率气温监测方法。

Method: 使用Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，首先通过编码年温度循环的神经网络重建GOES-16地表温度数据，然后利用另一个神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温，并通过深度集成学习进行不确定性估计。

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录进行测试，在站点验证中达到1.93°C的小时气温制图精度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了地表温度重建和气温预测的流程化，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Motivation: 探究通用预训练模型和领域专用模型在细粒度动物重识别任务中的性能差异，以及后处理度量学习对不同类型骨干网络的影响

Method: 使用K近邻分类器结合鲁棒阈值方法进行个体识别，比较DINOv2和MegaDescriptor作为骨干网络，并测试三元组学习投影头对两种模型的提升效果

Result: 领域专用模型MegaDescriptor经过三元组学习后性能提升0.13分，而通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分，验证损失停滞且可视化显示通用流形难以重塑

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、数据有限的重新识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练至关重要

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Method: 基于GhostNetV3架构开发GhostNetV3-Small变体，并比较多种知识蒸馏技术（传统蒸馏、教师助手、教师集成）

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构调整比知识蒸馏更具影响力，需要在低分辨率领域进一步研究有效的模型设计和先进蒸馏技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动分析通常假设简化运动结构或依赖关节标注，但机械组件（如齿轮）的运动来自几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动

Method: 构建了包含693个合成齿轮组件的MechBench数据集，并提出DYNAMO模型——一个依赖感知的神经网络模型，直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO在强基线方法中表现优异，能够准确且时间一致地预测各种齿轮配置的运动

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于CAD组件中耦合机械运动的数据驱动学习

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花收获和高通量表型分析提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Conclusion: TSDF框架显著提升了模型性能，同时保持了紧凑的参数规模，能够灵活高效地利用所有可用数据

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的tokenizer训练方案，包括主训练和后训练，通过模拟生成过程中的噪声和优化解码器，显著提高了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>

Motivation: 当前图像生成模型在预构建的潜在空间中捕获图像分布，但重建分布和生成分布存在显著差异。现有tokenizer仅关注重建任务，未考虑生成过程中的采样误差。

Method: 提出主训练和后训练两阶段方案：主训练采用潜在扰动策略模拟生成噪声，提高tokenizer鲁棒性；后训练针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器，减少生成与重建token的分布差异。

Result: 使用约400M参数的生成器，经过主训练的离散tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，加上后训练后进一步提升至1.36 gFID。实验广泛验证了该方法对离散和连续tokenizer以及自回归和基于扩散的生成器的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的tokenizer训练方案有效解决了重建与生成分布差异问题，显著提升了生成质量，并提出了新的评估指标pFID成功关联tokenizer性能与生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达成本低、耐用且抗遮挡，但角分辨率差。现有方法缺乏标准化基础模型和大数据集，需要从零训练特定任务模型

Method: 收集了100万样本(29小时)的最大原始雷达数据集，训练了GRT(Generalizable Radar Transformer)基础模型，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可微调适应不同任务，数据规模呈对数增长(每10倍数据提升20%)，原始数据使用相当于10倍训练数据增益

Conclusion: 估计需要约1亿样本(3000小时)数据才能充分发挥GRT的潜力，为毫米波雷达领域提供了重要的基础模型和大规模数据集

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

Result: 实验发现：真实标注的描述性显著影响模型性能；大型模型在语义理解方面表现优异但并非总是优于小模型；JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声会显著降低所有模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特性和噪声鲁棒性之间的细微权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，在缺乏像素级标注的场景下提供了实用解决方案，具有出色的定位精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism

TL;DR: 提出MGNM多模态图网络模型，利用GNN显式建模人-物交互关系，在HOI检测任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中未能显式建模关系结构，而GNN更适合显式建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到最先进性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，并保持稀有和非稀有类别的有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法能够有效提升HOI检测性能，显式关系建模和多模态特征交互是关键因素

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

TL;DR: VQT-Light是一个基于VQVAE和ViT架构的新型光照估计框架，通过将光照估计转化为多分类任务，实现了40FPS的推理速度，并在纹理细节和保真度方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照估计方法要么难以恢复光照图的详细纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持轻量快速又能提供高质量光照估计的解决方案

Method: 提出VQVAE-ViT混合架构，包含特征提取和光照估计两个模块：使用VQVAE提取离散特征避免后验坍塌，使用ViT捕获全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计制定为多分类任务

Result: 模型实现了40FPS的推理速度，在多个评估指标上均有提升，能够预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图，在定性和定量实验中都优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: VQT-Light通过结合VQVAE和ViT的优势，成功解决了光照估计中的纹理细节和运行速度平衡问题，为计算机视觉和图形学中的光照估计任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的一致性蒸馏方法在目标时间步选择上主要依赖确定性或随机策略，需要为不同蒸馏过程专门设计采样调度器，限制了扩散模型在实际应用中的采样灵活性和潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，显著提高了扩散模型的生成性能，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出针对LiDAR定位的新型对抗攻击框架DisorientLiDAR，通过逆向工程识别关键点并策略性移除，显著降低定位精度，并在物理世界中验证了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到视觉不可察觉的对抗攻击，但针对自动驾驶定位系统的攻击研究较少，大多数对抗攻击集中在3D感知领域。

Method: 通过逆向工程定位模型（如特征提取网络）识别关键点，策略性地移除包含Top-K关键点的区域，使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界中隐藏关键区域。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上测试三个最先进的点云配准模型（HRegNet、D3Feat和GeoTransformer），移除关键区域显著降低了配准精度；在Autoware平台上，隐藏少量关键区域即可引起明显的定位漂移；物理世界攻击成功复现了KITTI数据中的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了针对LiDAR定位的对抗攻击的可行性和有效性，通过物理世界验证展示了攻击的真实性和普适性，为自动驾驶安全提供了重要警示。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 提出CIARD方法解决对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中清洁样本性能下降问题，通过多教师框架和连续对抗训练实现更好的鲁棒性和准确性平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性蒸馏方法虽然提升了学生模型的鲁棒性，但会导致清洁样本性能下降，主要原因是双教师模型的优化目标冲突和迭代生成的对抗样本导致教师模型性能退化

Method: 提出循环迭代ARD方法(CIARD)：1) 多教师框架配合对比推挽损失对齐来解决双教师优化目标冲突；2) 连续对抗再训练来维持教师模型对变化对抗样本的动态鲁棒性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上实验显示，CIARD在各种攻击场景下平均提升3.53%的对抗防御率，清洁样本准确率提升5.87%

Conclusion: CIARD在模型鲁棒性和泛化性平衡方面建立了新的基准，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性蒸馏的性能

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个语义对齐的多模态篡改检测数据集SAMM和检索增强的检测框架RamDG，解决了现有数据集中跨模态语义不一致的问题，在检测准确率上比现有方法提升2.06%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有篡改检测基准存在模态间不对齐问题，无法反映真实世界中篡改内容保持语义一致性的特点，需要构建更符合实际场景的数据集和检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1)构建SAMM数据集，先进行图像篡改再生成语义一致的文本描述；2)提出RamDG框架，通过检索外部知识作为辅助文本，结合图像伪造定位和深度篡改检测模块进行多模态分析。

Result: 在SAMM数据集上，RamDG框架比现有最先进方法的检测准确率高出2.06%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语义对齐的多模态篡改检测是重要研究方向，SAMM数据集和RamDG框架为解决真实世界中的多媒体内容篡改检测问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角地理定位中因视角变化导致的显著外观差异问题，现有方法忽视空间和语义信息，需要提取更具判别性的特征

Method: MFAF方法包含多频率分支块(MFB)和频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块，MFB捕获多尺度低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，FSA自适应关注频率特征的关键区域

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中取得竞争性性能，在无人机定位和导航任务中表现优异

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过频率注意力融合有效缓解背景噪声和视角变化的干扰，提升了跨视角地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统，但水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限，需要评估最新YOLO变体在水下环境的表现

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病和鱼类物种），创建四种训练规模，用相同超参数训练YOLOv8-s至v11-s，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间和FPS，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9后精度达到饱和，但推理速度显著提升。YOLOv10在速度和精度之间提供最佳平衡，适合嵌入式AUV部署

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个近期YOLO变体在水下图像上的控制比较，表明架构创新主要针对效率而非精度，YOLOv10最适合AUV应用，并提供了可复现的基准和代码库

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic

configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather

across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

*Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Mingyu Liu,Qingsheng Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，通过解构重建框架和去偏策略解决组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习中属性与对象的纠缠性以及现实数据的长尾分布限制了组合表示的可泛化性，受神经科学发现启发，提出利用想象力增强感知

Method: DeFA方法整合了解构重建框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，通过合成高保真组合特征来显式利用已见属性和对象的先验知识

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上，DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置下均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，实现了优异的组合泛化能力

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一个针对视觉-语言模型不对称性的新型MoE架构，通过三种专家组解决模态特定处理和跨模态交互的平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE方法在处理视觉和语言的不对称性时面临挑战，视觉信息空间完整而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家：模态内专家处理特定模态、双曲跨模态专家处理层次化跨模态交互、证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏差并保持上下文基础

Result: 在实验中，AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别提升26.58%和15.45%准确率，激活参数比密集模型少25.45%

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了MoE模型在跨模态任务中的平衡问题，显著提升性能同时减少参数使用

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，未能捕捉部分可观测性和动态变化下的长时程推理和记忆利用挑战。

Method: 提出了局部可观测迷宫导航和匹配消除两个动态空间基准测试，并设计了基于主观经验的记忆机制来实现跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，这些基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已公开可用。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息映射到2D图像域，解决了多视图不一致性问题，并能表示复杂内部结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型依赖多视图扩散先验，容易产生视图不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构和非平凡拓扑

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为紧凑的多层2D球面投影表示，完全在图像域操作，继承强大的2D扩散先验

Result: SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 球面投影表示为单视图3D生成提供了统一、灵活且高效的解决方案，能够同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 利用防御机制增强攻击，Defense2Attack方法通过嵌入对抗性扰动和防御风格提示，在单次尝试中实现高效越狱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLMs)能力强大，但存在越狱漏洞。现有越狱方法的有效性和效率仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御融入攻击流程能显著提升越狱效果。

Method: 提出Defense2Attack方法，包含三个核心组件：(1)视觉优化器嵌入具有肯定语义的通用对抗扰动；(2)文本优化器使用防御风格提示优化输入；(3)通过强化微调生成红队后缀增强越狱效果。

Result: 在4个VLMs和4个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱VLMs提供了新视角，证明了利用防御模式可以更有效地绕过安全防护机制。

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

TL;DR: 通过动态激活球象谐正或法线、调整SH阶数和任务解耦剪枝的方法，实现了更高保神度的3D重建且参数更少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Gaussian Splatting方法中属性分配正则过于粗糕导致的梯度冲突和表示效率低下的问题

Method: 使用表面重建模块监督的动态密化策略，根据梯度大小自适应调整每个Gaussian的SH阶数，并采用任务解耦剪枝策略

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面都超越了现有最优方法，以显著更少的参数数量实现了更优称的性能

Conclusion: 该管理方法不依赖于特定模型，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时大幅减少模型大小

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

### [46] [Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析ConvNeXt架构深度可分离网络中学习到的8个主关键滤波器，证明了这些滤波器可以用离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，并展示了用理想化滤波器替换学习滤波器在网络中的良好预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野滤波器的数学特性，验证它们是否可以被建模为可分离的空间滤波操作，并探索用理想化模型替代学习滤波器的可行性。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器的空间扩散度量（加权均值和方差），然后使用高斯核的离散模拟构建理想化感受野模型，通过两种方式进行模型拟合：要求空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数差异。

Result: 学习到的滤波器可以通过可分离的空间滤波操作很好地建模，非中心滤波器的空间偏移接近半个网格单位。理想化模型与学习滤波器在定性上表现出良好的相似性。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中的学习滤波器可以很好地用离散尺度空间滤波器近似，用理想化滤波器替换学习滤波器在网络中表现出良好的预测性能。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 研究多模态LLM与人类在图像质量评估方面的差异，发现LLM在图像属性判断上与人存在显著差异，特别是在解剖准确性等属性上表现较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本生成图像模型具有挑战性，现有研究缺乏对多模态LLM如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图）进行质量判断的深入理解

Method: 首先使用合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，通过图像质量属性间的跨任务相关性分析人类判断；重复相同分析比较LLM表现；生成针对每个质量属性的合成数据集进行详细研究

Result: 发现图像质量属性间的关系在LLM中比人类弱得多；人类能轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但多模态LLM在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上难以学习判断

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，LLM在理解某些图像质量属性方面与人存在明显差距

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

TL;DR: ReCOT是一个循环跨视角目标地理定位Transformer，将CVOGL任务重新定义为循环定位问题，通过可学习token和迭代注意力机制实现精确定位，并引入SAM知识蒸馏和分层注意力模块，在减少60%参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角目标地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归目标位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏纠错机制。

Method: 提出循环定位框架，使用可学习token编码查询意图，迭代优化位置预测；集成SAM知识蒸馏策略提供语义指导；设计分层注意力模块增强参考特征。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，同时相比之前SOTA方法减少了60%的参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略，有效解决了跨视角目标地理定位中的噪声和纠错问题，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成中的实时性挑战，为城市管理、城市规划、土地测量等领域的实时应用提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式令牌表示改进和保持强大归纳偏置，有效解决了ViT在少样本学习中的挑战，为少样本分类提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 在多样性和真实性方面显著优于现有方法，下游异常检测性能得到显著提升

Conclusion: DH-Diff框架有效解决了合成异常数据的关键问题，为制造业视觉检测提供了高质量的数据增强方案

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: SPAM是一个基于深度学习的超像素分割框架，能够在保持超像素规则性的同时实现高精度分割，支持语义无关分割和交互式对象聚焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低级特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高级特征但往往牺牲超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差。

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，在推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与对象掩模对齐，并能处理任何先验高级分割和不确定区域。

Result: 综合实验表明，SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量均优于最先进方法，成为各种应用的强大工具。

Conclusion: SPAM提供了一个准确且规则的超像素分割框架，具有处理不确定区域和交互式对象聚焦的能力，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

TL;DR: SAGA提出选择性自适应门控机制，改进线性注意力中的KV信息压缩问题，在保持线性复杂度同时提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性注意力对历史KV信息进行均匀压缩，导致特征冗余和方向对齐损失，造成性能差距

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束，同时提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下吞吐量提升1.76倍，GPU峰值内存减少2.69倍，ImageNet数据集top-1准确率最高提升4.4%

Conclusion: SAGA通过选择性门控机制有效解决了线性注意力的性能瓶颈问题，实现了计算效率和模型效果的双重提升

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于小规模数据集，需要研究数据规模和预训练范式对性能的影响

Method: 使用350万张单机构胸部X光片，持续预训练MI2（CLIP范式）和RAD-DINO（DINOv2范式），评估分类、分割和报告生成任务

Result: MI2在放射学发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上更强；使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签训练MI2可提升性能；30k领域内样本即可超越开源基础模型

Conclusion: 机构特定的持续预训练具有重要价值，医疗机构可利用领域内数据获得显著性能提升

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Motivation: 由于NeRF生成的图像存在独特伪影，现有单一指标在不同数据集上表现不一致，需要开发更鲁棒的评估方法来准确衡量NeRF输出质量。

Method: 结合DISTS（深度图像结构与纹理相似性）和VMAF（视频多方法评估融合）两种基于不同感知方法的指标，采用两种归一化策略和两种融合策略进行组合。

Result: 在Synthetic和Outdoor两个数据集上测试了三种配置，显示融合指标相比单一指标在相关性系数上表现更优，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多指标融合方法能够克服单一指标的局限性，显著提升NeRF生成图像质量评估与主观感知的一致性，为NeRF评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Method: 开发了将视觉标注映射到200多个标记区域的系统，使用引导解码、思维链推理和少样本提示等技术，生成了1000个髌骨脱位诊断的合成视觉文档

Result: 生成的文档对诊断位置和严重程度敏感且与性别无关。仅使用合成数据训练的模型在70个真实文档上达到88%的F1分数

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据在解决罕见疾病数据稀缺方面具有巨大潜力，虽然方法针对医学领域设计，但可适配到其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Result: 在Open Images和KITTI数据集上，CCS与F1-score、概率检测质量和最优纳米调整成本指标达到90%以上一致性

Conclusion: CCS提供了一种模型无关的标签免费评估方法，为物体检测器的实际部署监控提供了可靠基础

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Conclusion: 利用扩散模型的预训练条件编码器为原型扩展提供通用特征源，构建的双流原型框架有效解决了少样本3D分割中的关键挑战

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过结合模型级工具组织和强化学习训练，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了手术三联体识别中的优化冲突问题，验证了其处理长尾数据分布的能力

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

TL;DR: CLVS方法通过跨层视觉平滑技术，在大型视觉语言模型中引入视觉记忆机制，持续关注关键对象，显著提升了视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然能准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力持续时间很短。假设持续关注关键对象可以提升模型的视觉能力。

Method: 提出跨层视觉平滑(CLVS)方法，包含视觉记忆机制，在首层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层结合前层记忆进行联合考虑，并通过不确定性指标判断视觉理解完成度来终止平滑过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个大型视觉语言模型上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化能力，CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 跨层视觉平滑技术通过维持对关键对象的持续注意力，有效提升了大型视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，特别是在复杂的关系和属性理解任务上表现突出。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个多模态场景图引导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，显著提升了融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合方法主要依赖低层视觉线索，难以捕捉高层次语义信息；而基于文本的语义引导方法缺乏结构化建模和空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合效果。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，深度耦合文本和视觉派生的结构化场景图，通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合模块同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著优于现有最优方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面，并在下游任务中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结构化场景图引导的多模态融合方法能够有效提升红外与可见光图像融合的质量，为复杂环境下的图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换和补丁相似性评分，在医学图像中实现精确的异常定位和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中正常组织的细粒度变异性（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成挑战，需要解决这一问题以提高异常检测精度。

Method: 采用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建，然后通过观察图像与生成图像对的补丁相似性评分来实现精确的异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT扫描和脑部MRI中均显示出改进的像素级异常分割性能，DICE分数分别相对提升+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法在感染性疾病病变检测和缺血性卒中病变分割任务中表现出良好的泛化能力和优越性能，优于其他基于重建的最先进方法。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

*Hojat Ardi,Amir Jahanshahi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个基于时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过显式时间建模增强SiamTPN架构，解决空中目标跟踪中的时间依赖性问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽视时间依赖，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。相关Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性和特征表示能力。

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率提升13.7%，精度提升14.7%。在Jetson Nano上实时运行达7.1 FPS，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了强大而高效的解决方案，适用于嵌入式实时应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段压缩管道用于YOLOv8模型，包括稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道级知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS，仅损失少量检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行航空目标检测，需要在保持性能的同时实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1）稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2）利用批归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3）使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道级知识蒸馏来缓解精度下降。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M（减少73.51%），FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%。推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS，结合TensorRT后达到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现高效的模型压缩，在资源受限场景下实现高吞吐量的实时部署，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准质量验证方法都将其视为分类任务，只能将配准质量划分为有限的几个类别，无法提供精细的量化评估。

Method: 使用回归方法进行配准验证，扩展了配准误差相关特征，采用多尺度提取和基于注意力的聚合方式。

Result: 在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别适用于具有异质空间密度的点云，并能显著改善下游映射任务的质量。

Conclusion: 回归方法比分类方法能提供更精细的点云配准质量量化，多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合提高了估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS是一个基于4D雷达增强的自监督3D重建框架，专门针对动态驾驶场景，通过4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化和速度引导的点跟踪模型，解决了现有方法在动态物体重建中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督3D重建方法在动态物体重建方面存在不足，主要由于运动估计不准确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素重建不完整或失真。

Method: 提出4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态物体并恢复单目深度尺度；开发速度引导的点跟踪模型（VGPT），在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上评估，4DRadar-GS在动态驾驶场景3D重建方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预分解对象级高斯和CLIP特征聚合的新方法，用于3D场景的开放词汇对象提取，避免了传统语义蒸馏的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在实时逼真渲染方面取得进展，但其模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但存在alpha混合平均语义的问题，无法实现3D级理解。

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的嵌入包，完全绕过可微分渲染进行语义处理。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了准确的开放词汇对象检索和无缝任务适应，为3D场景理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Time-step Mixup知识迁移(TMKT)方法，通过在SNN的不同时间步长上插值RGB和DVS输入，实现跨模态的细粒度混合，解决事件相机与脉冲神经网络训练中的数据稀缺和模态分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与脉冲神经网络结合具有能效优势，但事件数据稀缺且DVS输出稀疏，现有方法忽略了RGB与DVS模态间的显著分布差异，导致知识迁移效果受限。

Method: 提出TMKT策略：1）利用SNN异步特性在不同时间步长插值RGB和DVS输入；2）引入模态感知辅助学习目标支持跨模态标签混合；3）增强模型对不同模态的区分能力。

Result: 方法实现了更平滑的知识迁移，缓解了训练中的模态偏移，在脉冲图像分类任务中取得了优越性能，多个数据集上的实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: TMKT通过时间步长混合和模态感知学习目标，有效解决了跨模态知识迁移的挑战，为事件相机与SNN的高效能效视觉处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的交互式多模态多表面分割方法，通过多模态融合和特定架构设计，显著降低了分割所需的点击次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像中多个表面同时存在且相互纠缠的分割挑战，特别是当这些表面紧密相邻时的复杂分割问题。

Method: 设计了一个网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，预测改进的分割掩码。架构设计确保RGB主干网络作为黑盒使用，并在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成交互信息以减少响应时间。

Result: 在DeLiVER数据集上平均每个表面减少1.28次点击（NoC@90），在MFNet数据集上减少1.19次点击。RGB-only基线在传统单掩码交互分割场景中也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多表面交互分割问题，多模态融合策略显著提升了分割效率，同时保持了在传统场景下的优秀性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档因笔迹不规则、墨水褪色、布局复杂以及标注数据稀缺等问题，使得传统全监督学习方法不适用，需要开发能够用最少标注数据实现有效分割的鲁棒方法。

Method: 采用少样本学习方法，参赛系统仅允许使用U-DIADS-TL数据集中每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，处理包含多样化布局、退化程度和非标准格式的古代手稿。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛旨在推动少样本学习在历史文档分析中的应用，为人文学者提供只需最少手动标注即可使用的自动化工具，促进历史研究中文档分析技术的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Motivation: 解决SIREN在频率支持与目标信号频谱不匹配时出现的频谱瓶颈问题，避免模型输出趋近于零且无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量

Method: 提出WINNER方法，用高斯噪声扰动均匀初始化的SIREN权重，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数

Result: 在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练的自适应、目标感知初始化策略开辟了新途径

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Motivation: 解决从第一视角视频数据中识别用户动作错误的问题，特别是处理细微且不频繁的错误带来的挑战。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：第一阶段使用冻结ViViT模型和LoRA调优ViViT模型提取特征，通过特征级专家模块组合；第二阶段训练三个不同目标分类器（重加权交叉熵、AUC损失、标签感知损失），通过分类级专家模块融合预测。

Result: 该方法实现了强劲性能，特别是在识别罕见和模糊错误实例方面表现突出。

Conclusion: DR-MoE框架有效解决了动作错误检测中的类别不平衡和分布偏斜问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务上显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专用AI生成图像检测器在精心设计的基准测试中表现优异，但在真实场景中失败率极高，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型（VFM）上的简单线性分类器，通过分析文本-图像相似性来探测合成图像与伪造相关概念的关联

Result: VFM方法在真实场景检测准确率上比专用检测器提升超过20%，但模型对预训练后数据表现显著下降

Conclusion: 更新的视觉基础模型的原始能力比静态检测器的精心设计更有效；真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Motivation: 单图像3D头像重建任务存在根本性的不适定性，由于单目输入信息有限，难以在生成过程中控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视角生成模型（Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型重建3D高斯表示

Conclusion: 提出的Dream3DAvatar方法有效解决了单图像3D重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量、可控制的3D头像生成

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有RL方法从LLMs直接移植到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理，面临更复杂的任务挑战

Method: 两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段专门增强推理能力。采用数据集级采样解决RL训练中的优势消失问题

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验结果表明该方法有效，PeBR-R1模型在各种视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功解决了VLMs中感知和推理能力的联合增强问题，为视觉语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HERO框架，通过内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择，实现高分辨率视觉语言模型的高效推理，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型(HR-LVLMs)通过将高分辨率图像裁剪成局部瓦片并独立编码，虽然提升了细粒度视觉理解能力，但显著增加了视觉token数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 基于对视觉token利用率的实证研究发现，提出HERO框架：1) 根据视觉显著性和任务相关性评估瓦片重要性；2) 利用CLIP编码器中CLS token的两阶段注意力模式；3) 选择性保留具有互补角色的视觉token。

Result: HERO在各种基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-精度权衡，且无需训练即可部署。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过早期丢弃不重要的视觉token来优化模型性能。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Conclusion: TFANet通过三阶段特征对齐网络有效解决了复杂场景下的多模态错位问题，提升了指代图像分割的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息并可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更好的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U形深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标直接拟合傅里叶域信息；改进基于VGG的感知损失，在深度特征上嵌入KL散度。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LLFDisc在定性和定量评估中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和网络架构，在傅里叶域图像增强方面取得了显著改进，实现了更好的全局信息保持和结构保真度。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

TL;DR: MSDNet是一个多阶段蒸馏框架，通过特征重建和轻量级扩散网络，高效地将密集LiDAR先验知识转移到4D雷达特征中，实现高保真重建和低延迟推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D雷达超分辨率方法存在训练成本高、推理延迟高、泛化能力差的问题，难以平衡准确性和效率

Method: 提出两阶段蒸馏框架：第一阶段进行重建引导的特征蒸馏，第二阶段进行扩散引导的特征蒸馏，并引入噪声适配器自适应对齐噪声水平

Conclusion: MSDNet通过多阶段蒸馏有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率的准确性和效率平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Result: 大量实验证实了框架的有效性，展示了其在推进视频语言模型方面的潜力

Conclusion: 该多视频协作框架为解决视频推理中的时空不完整性问题提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Conclusion: WHU-STree数据集为解决街道树木盘点问题提供了重要资源，识别了关键挑战并概述了未来研究方向，包括多模态融合、多任务协作、跨域泛化等。

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的出现为医学对比视觉语言预训练提供了前所未有的机会，但如何利用LLMs实现大规模监督预训练并提升视觉-语言对齐性能仍需探索

Method: 使用LLMs自动提取放射报告中的诊断标签（AUC>96%），创建低成本"银标准"数据集（5万CT图像-报告对仅需约3美元），在此基础上进行监督预训练，使用3D ResNet-18和标准CLIP训练

Result: 在CT-RATE上实现83.8% AUC的零样本诊断，在RAD-ChestCT上达到77.3% AUC，跨模态检索性能显著提升（图像-图像MAP@50=53.7%，报告-图像Recall@100=52.2%）

Conclusion: LLMs能够促进更高效和可扩展的医学AI系统，监督预训练从根本上改善了对比视觉-语言对齐性能

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,

framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network

YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究提出的End4检测方法有效解决了渗析模型生成图像的识别问题，为防止此类技术的恶意使用提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Result: 在4个公开数据集上验证，在下游分割任务中持续获得性能提升，模型轻量化达到16,000倍以上

Conclusion: CMTSSL框架在轻量级模型上实现了良好的表征学习能力，为实际HSI应用提供了强大的潜力

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: ResidualViT能有效处理视频时序密集任务，大幅提升效率同时保持性能，适用于零样本和全监督场景

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Conclusion: AI驱动的游戏化平台能够提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训，重新构想了医学AI资源在教育中的应用

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,

StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，适用于无传感器3D输入或真实3D标注的野外视频，展示了强大的场景理解能力

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with
metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier.
Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed
radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By
integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly
improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study
demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model
generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical
artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease

Abstract: Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for
early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class
imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation
models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer
generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.
In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework
tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging
the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method
processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive
slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further
address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised
contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class
separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI
dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong
anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and
significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing
pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation
for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation
is publicly available at https://github.com/Rafsani/DinoAtten3D.git.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge
to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the
available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and
treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of
generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle
patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI
systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report
generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions
between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive
medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation
enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)
Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing
long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance
the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust
and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated
using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis
demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by
automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,
diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要可靠的不确定性量化，但现有方法依赖单一专家标注作为真实标签，忽视了医疗领域普遍存在的评分者间变异问题。

Method: 提出MEGAN多专家门控网络，使用不同真实标签和建模策略训练多个EDL模型，通过门控网络优化整合各模型的预测和不确定性估计。

Conclusion: MEGAN不仅提高了预测性能和校准度，还通过不确定性指导的样本分层减少了标注负担，提高了UC临床试验的效率和一致性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI.
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to
quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods
such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these
methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model
training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address
this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates
uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models
trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating
network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,
enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively
benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease
severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore
(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective
UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%
reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,
reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and
consistency in UC trials.

Conclusion: PerM-MoE方法显著提高了多模态模型在临床实际场景中的灵活性和预测性能，为阿尔茨海默病进展预测提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Method: 通过受光滑性和可逆性约束的微分同胚神经网络，将复杂三维几何映射到共同参考域，然后在参考域上训练神经算子来学习残余应力引起的变形场

Result: 该方法能够准确预测主方向和多方位的变形场，在不同几何形状（包括组件类型、尺寸和特征）的零件上实现了高精度和高效率

Conclusion: NDNO框架为不同几何结构件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，实现了对变化几何形状的快速适应

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising

Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement

integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain

Motivation: 现有的对抗鲁棒性方法存在不公平性问题，某些类别或群体更容易受到攻击。在现实任务中实现完美的公平性往往不可行，因此需要更可行的对称性公平概念。

Result: 在五个数据集和三种模型架构上的实验表明，Sy-FAR相比现有方法显著提高了公平对抗鲁棒性，运行速度更快且结果更一致。同时还能缓解目标类别易受攻击的不公平问题。

Conclusion: 对称性是一种更可行的公平性概念，Sy-FAR技术能够有效提升对抗鲁棒性的公平性，在安全关键任务中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the

Conclusion: 该框架为计算成像中的非线性逆问题提供了成本效益高、可泛化的解决方案，并为超越全息术的更广泛相干成像应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework
with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables
complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,
highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a
cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in
computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent
imaging applications beyond holography.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于100克以下小型无人机的自主高精度3D扫描系统，通过双重建管道实现实时数据捕获与飞行控制的反馈循环，动态调整轨迹以提高重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型无人机在室内和难以到达区域具有巨大潜力，但由于有效载荷和自主性限制，无法完成高质量3D重建等复杂任务

Method: 采用双重建管道：近实时SfM过程生成即时点云并动态调整无人机轨迹；非实时N3DR方法融合SfM相机位姿和UWB定位数据实现精确重建

Result: 在单机和多机配置实验中，动态轨迹调整相比静态飞行路径显著提高了重建质量

Conclusion: 该工作展示了可扩展的自主解决方案，释放了微型无人机在受限环境中进行精细3D重建的潜力，这一能力此前仅限于大型平台

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

TL;DR: LightVLA是一个简单有效的可微分视觉token剪枝框架，用于视觉-语言-动作模型，通过自适应剪枝减少计算开销同时提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型在资源受限平台部署时，注意力计算对大量视觉token的处理成为瓶颈，需要高效的token剪枝方法

Method: 使用动态查询评估视觉token重要性，采用Gumbel softmax实现可微分token选择，通过微调学习保留信息丰富的token

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，FLOPs减少59.1%，延迟降低38.2%，任务成功率提升2.9%

Conclusion: LightVLA是首个将自适应视觉token剪枝应用于VLA任务的工作，为实现高效、强大且实用的实时机器人系统迈出重要一步

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN是一个通过多轮强化学习实现主动探索的视觉语言导航框架，相比传统方法显著提升性能且使用更小模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VLN方法依赖专家轨迹、缺乏主动探索能力、数据收集和训练成本高的问题

Method: 两阶段框架：先用少量专家轨迹进行模仿学习初始化，然后通过多轮RL进行主动探索，使用GRPO目标优化多个rollout，并引入动态早停策略

Result: 相比IL基线和现有后训练方法获得最大性能提升，与最先进方法达到竞争性性能但使用更小模型

Conclusion: ActiveVLN通过主动探索和多轮强化学习有效解决了VLN任务中的探索效率问题，为视觉语言导航提供了新的训练范式

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Motivation: 视觉-惯性融合在机器人导航和增强现实等应用中至关重要，但现有基于B样条的连续时间标定方法计算成本高，需要更高效的标定方案来适应大规模设备部署需求。

Method: 采用离散时间状态表示方法进行空间-时间标定，通过技术创新克服了离散方法在时间标定方面的局限性，实现了高效计算。

Result: 开发出了一种极其高效的标定方法，相比连续时间方法显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了标定精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模视觉-惯性设备标定提供了高效解决方案，具有重要的研究和工业应用价值，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning

benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二分类转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。需要确定最有效的输出格式来增强临床医生-AI性能，但这是一个难以大规模评估的经验性挑战。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.
