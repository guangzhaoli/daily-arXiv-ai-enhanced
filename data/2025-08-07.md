### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动从文本生成虚拟指令的新方法，以简化VR培训内容的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR培训内容开发耗时且需要专业知识，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 系统由LLM模块和智能模块组成，前者提取文本信息，后者生成动画演示和视觉提示。

Result: 该方法提高了培训效果，降低了开发成本，使VR培训更具扩展性和适应性。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs的自动化方法为VR培训提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于极坐标的异常值检测算法（PCOD），用于提高圆拟合在工业应用中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业质量控制中，圆拟合算法的准确性常因噪声点集而降低，需要有效的异常值检测方法。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: PCOD算法在工业垫圈直径测量中表现最佳，优于其他圆拟合和异常值检测方法。

Conclusion: PCOD算法能有效提升工业环境中圆拟合的精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（基于转换因子和基于像素）以提高相机测量系统的精度，显著减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测量不同直径的零件时，现有系统因机械和软件因素导致误差较大，需要更精确的方法。

Method: 使用多个已知参考零件，分别通过转换因子法和像素法估计未知零件的直径。

Result: 实验显示，误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米，显著提高了测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量参考零件即可实现高精度测量，为直径测量领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more

### [6] [A Large Language Model Powered Integrated Circuit Footprint Geometry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03725)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM4-IC8K框架，利用LLMs解决PCB中IC机械图纸的几何标注问题，通过两阶段训练提升性能，并引入ICGeo8K数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏自动化方法从IC机械图纸中直接标注PCB封装几何，且现有LMMs在几何感知上表现不佳。

Method: 提出LLM4-IC8K框架，将IC机械图纸视为图像，分三步解决几何标注问题，并通过合成数据预训练和真实数据微调提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4-IC8K在ICGeo8K数据集上优于现有LMMs。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K为自动化IC几何标注提供了有效解决方案，并通过多模态数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热红外图像在机器人感知任务中潜力巨大，但固定模式噪声严重影响了目标检测和定位等任务。

Method: 利用预训练的稳定扩散模型，通过结合潜在空间和小波变换损失的新损失函数进行微调，并采用级联细化阶段增强细节。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有去噪方法，且具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中表现出色，适合实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

### [8] [What is Beneath Misogyny: Misogynous Memes Classification and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03732)
*Kushal Kanwar,Dushyant Singh Chauhan,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MM-Misogyny的多模态方法，用于检测、分类和解释模因中的厌女内容，并在新数据集WBMS上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模因在现代社会中广泛传播，但其中可能隐含有害的意识形态（如厌女症）。由于其多模态特性和社会背景的复杂性，检测和理解厌女模因是一个研究挑战。

Method: MM-Misogyny通过分别处理文本和图像模态，并通过交叉注意力机制将它们统一为多模态上下文，然后使用分类器和大型语言模型（LLM）进行标注、分类和解释。

Result: 模型在WBMS数据集上表现出色，不仅能检测和分类厌女内容，还能提供对厌女症在生活领域中如何运作的细粒度理解。

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny方法在检测和解释厌女模因方面优于现有方法，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖微调或重新训练模型，计算成本高且可能干扰模型原有能力，因此需要一种高效且无需训练的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能在多种场景下生成视觉一致的主题，同时保持扩散模型的创造力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需训练，成功解决了跨场景主题一致性问题，同时保留了模型的原有能力。

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DINOv2架构的深度学习方法，结合开源地图和射频数据，提升智能城市环境映射的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能城市映射技术（如卫星图像、LiDAR扫描）存在成本高、可访问性差和精度不足的问题，而开源地图平台的数据存在人为误差和环境变化带来的偏差。

Method: 采用视觉Transformer架构，联合处理射频数据和地图数据，利用空间依赖性和结构先验提升映射精度。

Result: 在合成数据集上测试，模型在IoU指标上达到65.3%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过融合多模态数据，显著提升了环境映射的准确性，为智能城市应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

### [11] [VQ-DeepISC: Vector Quantized-Enabled Digital Semantic Communication with Channel Adaptive Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03740)
*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量量化的数字语义通信系统VQ-DeepISC，通过离散化语义特征实现高效传输，并在实验中表现出优越的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义特征的离散化在数字通信系统中具有重要应用潜力，但如何在压缩过程中保持连续性和上下文信息，同时确保对信道退化的鲁棒性，是一个关键挑战。

Method: 设计了基于Swin Transformer的分层语义特征提取结构，结合向量量化模块将特征投影到离散空间，实现基于索引的高效传输。此外，开发了注意力机制驱动的信道自适应模块，并采用KLD正则化和EMA技术优化训练过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在重建保真度上优于基准方法。

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC通过离散化语义特征和动态优化传输过程，为数字语义通信提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Conclusion: 研究为GeoAI的理论和方法学基础提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

*Riccardo Fiorista,Awad Abdelhalim,Anson F. Stewart,Gabriel L. Pincus,Ian Thistle,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用CCTV图像数据通过计算机视觉技术实时估计地铁站台拥挤度的方法，并提出了新的优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计地铁站台拥挤度可提升运营决策能力，改善安全和乘客体验，但目前依赖间接数据，实时性不足。

Method: 比较了三种计算机视觉方法（目标检测、人群分类、语义分割），并提出了一种基于线性优化的新方法。

Result: 在600多小时视频数据上测试，证明计算机视觉方法能有效估计拥挤度。

Conclusion: CCTV数据可独立实现精确的实时拥挤度估计，支持及时运营响应。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Conclusion: 该框架为农业中的深度学习应用提供了显著进步，特别是在处理图像退化问题时表现出色。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

TL;DR: Refine-IQA是一个多阶段强化微调框架，通过增强低层次视觉质量感知和监督“思考”过程，显著提升了图像质量评估（IQA）任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RFT的IQA方法缺乏对“思考”过程的奖励监督，且未明确增强模型的低层次视觉质量感知能力，限制了性能上限。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多任务奖励函数增强视觉质量感知；第二阶段引入概率差异奖励策略监督“思考”过程。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务上表现优异，并激活了强大的质量解释能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA通过多阶段设计和奖励监督，显著提升了IQA任务的性能，并展示了强大的质量解释能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高吞吐量4D-STEM数据采集中的噪声、中心漂移和椭圆畸变问题导致定量测量偏差，传统算法缺乏通用性。

Method: 结合注意力增强的U-Net和ResNet架构，通过大规模模拟数据集训练，实现去噪、中心校正和畸变校准。

Result: 去噪任务中均方误差降低50%，中心检测任务中平均误差低于0.04像素，优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为4D-STEM实时分析提供了高效、通用的解决方案，支持自动化表征。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Result: 模型生成的基于点的海马形状表示比现有方法更真实，并展示了在条件生成和反事实生成等下游任务中的应用。

Conclusion: 该模型有效生成了具有点对应关系的形状表示，为下游任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注高质量视频，难以扩展到开放世界中的多样化音频-视频类别。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段自动筛选大规模视频进行预训练，学习多样化但不完美的音频-视频对齐；第二阶段在小规模高质量手动标注数据上微调。通过多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步性，并利用预训练模型减少额外可训练参数。

Result: 在AVSync48基准测试中表现优异，减少了对手动标注的依赖超过10倍，并能泛化到许多开放类别。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了高质量数据的需求，同时保持了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层次特征和模型特定特征，通用性和鲁棒性不足，而RAG方法在视觉领域尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID结合微调的CLIP图像编码器和视觉语言模型（VLM），动态检索相关图像并融合查询图像，形成增强输入。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下仍保持80.27%的准确率。

Conclusion: RAVID在AI生成图像检测中实现了最先进的性能，尤其在鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 从2D图像估计食物营养含量对健康监测至关重要，但现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可重复性。

Method: 使用ImageNet和COYO预训练的ViT模型，与CNN基线模型及JFT-300M预训练方法对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上进行评估。

Result: JFT-300M预训练模型表现最佳，COYO预训练模型表现意外差于ImageNet预训练模型。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计的迁移学习效果至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一个用于3D医学图像分割的数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部关注难分割区域，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练样本和标注的稀缺性，弱监督医学图像分割常采用数据增强方法，但随机混合体积块会破坏3D医学图像的解剖连续性，导致结构不一致和难分割区域训练不足。

Method: JanusNet通过Slice-Block Shuffle步骤沿随机轴对齐打乱同索引切片块，保留解剖上下文；同时通过Confidence-Guided Displacement步骤利用预测可靠性替换块，增强难分割区域的信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上的实验表明，JanusNet显著优于现有方法，例如在仅20%标注数据的Synapse数据集上实现了4%的DSC提升。

Conclusion: JanusNet是一种即插即用的双阶段框架，能够有效利用解剖信息，提升弱监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Result: 结果显示大多数模型在无指导时难以主动检测错误，且对不同错误类型的识别能力差异显著。

Conclusion: 结论是LMMs需要增强对输入有效性的主动验证能力，以解决现有问题。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

TL;DR: PDSSNet通过结合类语义和空间结构信息，解决了遥感图像语义分割中的高类内方差和高类间相似性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在遥感图像语义分割中难以统一类表示和区分相似特征，导致结果不完整。PDSSNet旨在通过类原型和结构信息的协同来解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了三个模块：APEM（自适应原型提取模块）确保语义准确性；SSCM（语义-结构协调模块）遵循语义优先、结构其次的原则；CSAM（通道相似性调整模块）动态调整步长以关注类间区分特征。

Result: PDSSNet在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过类语义和空间结构的协同，显著提升了遥感图像语义分割的精度和完整性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

TL;DR: DCAR是一种双提示学习框架，通过联合优化属性和类别特征，提升图像-文本检索任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示学习在图像分类等任务中表现优异，但在图像-文本检索任务中面临挑战，尤其是细粒度属性和相似子类别的区分问题。

Method: 提出DCAR框架，动态调整语义和视觉维度的提示向量，联合优化属性和类别特征。具体包括基于文本-图像互信息相关性的属性描述权重更新，以及引入多视角负样本的类别匹配加权。

Result: 在构建的FDRD数据集上，DCAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，有效提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能，尤其是在细粒度数据上的表现。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合单目摄像头和2D雷达点云数据的NLoS行人定位框架，用于解决路边停车导致的盲区问题，提升道路安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路边停车导致的NLoS盲区对道路安全构成挑战，现有方法依赖预定义空间信息或简单反射假设，缺乏实时性和通用性。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停车车辆，结合深度估计和2D雷达点云数据，实现精确空间推断。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提前检测行人，提升道路安全。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态停车环境下的NLoS行人定位问题。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2 为 UDA 物体重识别提供了新方向，并支持进一步研究。

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet提出了一种高效的自挖掘先验引导联合频率增强网络，解决了现有暗图像恢复方法在计算负担、冗余操作和频率处理上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法依赖外部先验、多阶段增强流程冗余以及频率域方法全局计算需求高，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）生成轻量级内生先验，通过无损小波分解和联合傅里叶增强重构操作链，提出双频率引导框架（DFGF）优化高低频处理。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，显著提升效率并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内生先验和频率优化策略，实现了高效且高性能的暗图像恢复。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisualTrans是一个专为真实世界人机交互场景设计的视觉转换推理（VTR）基准测试，涵盖12种任务，评估空间、过程和定量推理能力，揭示了现有模型在动态多步推理中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在模拟与现实的差距、任务复杂性有限和推理覆盖不完整的问题，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 通过第一人称操作视频构建数据管道，包括任务选择、图像对提取、自动元数据标注和结构化问题生成，并进行人工验证。

Result: 评估显示现有视觉语言模型在静态空间任务中表现良好，但在动态多步推理场景中存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了时间建模和因果推理的基本弱点，为未来开发更强大的VTR系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: IPA-CP为小体积肿瘤分割提供了一种高效解决方案，展示了自适应增强和迭代伪标签策略的潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Result: 实验表明，解耦运动与身份不仅可行，还能提升合成质量与个性化灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语视频生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

TL;DR: 提出了DOMR框架，通过密集对象匹配和细化实现跨视角对象对应，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角对象对应是视觉理解中的关键但具有挑战性的任务。

Method: DOMR框架包含密集对象匹配模块（DOM）和掩模细化头，DOM联合建模多个对象的位置和语义关系。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中，平均IoU为49.7%（Ego→Exo）和55.2%（Exo→Ego），分别优于之前方法5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR框架通过整合视觉、空间和语义线索，显著提升了跨视角对象对应的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值的白盒Transformer框架（GPI-WT），用于k空间数据插值，显著提高了精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CNN）主要利用局部可预测性，忽略了k空间的全局依赖性。Transformer因其捕捉长程依赖的能力而受到启发，但其缺乏可解释性。

Method: 从湮灭角度提出全局可预测插值（GPI）作为新的k空间结构化低秩模型，将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开SLR模型的优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供了更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT是一种高效且可解释的k空间插值方法，为加速MRI提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Result: 实验表明，Uni-DocDiff在性能上媲美甚至超越专用模型，同时具备任务扩展性。

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff为文档修复提供了一种高效、可扩展的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算复杂度高和局部上下文信息捕捉不足的问题。

Method: 提出TCSAFormer，结合压缩注意力模块（CA）和双分支前馈网络模块（DBFFN），分别用于降低计算复杂性和增强局部特征捕捉能力。

Result: 在ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse数据集上，TCSAFormer表现出优于现有方法的性能，同时计算开销更低。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间实现了最佳平衡，为医学图像分割提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但MLLMs在此方面的表现尚未充分探索，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 基于SA-1B数据集，采用分层合成方法构建语义连贯的遮挡场景，并通过半自动流程标注问答对。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在遮挡感知任务中表现显著低于人类，且模型规模或思维过程无法完全弥补差距。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并启发MLLMs在视觉智能方面的进一步发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

Motivation: 现有分割网络（如UNet）通常关注单尺度内的特征交互，而忽略了多分辨率间的全局上下文依赖关系。

Method: 提出TNet，仅使用卷积和加法操作，逐步将低分辨率特征（富含全局上下文）融合到高分辨率特征（富含局部细节）中。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DSR是一种基于3D高斯溅射的超分辨率框架，利用现成的2D扩散模型提升3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如图像上采样或视频超分辨率未充分考虑3D一致性，3DSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合3D高斯溅射和2D扩散模型，无需额外微调即可提升视觉质量。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上验证，生成高分辨率且3D一致的结果。

Conclusion: 3DSR在保持3D结构一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

TL;DR: DET-GS提出了一种统一的深度和边缘感知正则化框架，用于3D高斯泼溅，显著提升了稀疏视图条件下的几何重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏视图条件下难以实现准确的几何重建，且传统平滑方法会破坏关键边缘和纹理。

Method: DET-GS通过分层几何深度监督框架和边缘感知深度正则化，结合RGB引导的边缘保留总变差损失，增强结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS在稀疏视图新视角合成任务中表现出色，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析因标注数据有限而受限，现有方法在跨模态交互中存在知识不对齐问题，未能充分发挥 VLM 的潜力。

Method: 提出 NEARL-CLIP，包含 USEformer（动态生成跨模态查询）和 OCA（正交技术分离新知识），促进模态交互。

Result: NEARL-CLIP 仅引入 1.46M 可学习参数，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP 通过跨模态交互和正交技术，有效解决了医学图像分析中的知识不对齐问题，释放了 VLM 的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

TL;DR: MLLMSeg是一个新颖的框架，通过充分利用MLLM视觉编码器中的视觉细节特征，无需额外视觉编码器，实现了性能和成本的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RES方法要么依赖参数繁重的SAM模型，要么采用轻量级但精度较低的方案，需要在性能和成本之间找到更好的平衡。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的视觉细节特征，设计DSFF模块融合细节和语义特征，并构建轻量级掩码解码器。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg在性能和成本上优于SAM-based和SAM-free的竞争对手。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过优化特征融合和解码器设计，实现了高效且精确的参考表达分割。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上表现优于现有车辆重识别和人员搜索方法。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle框架有效解决了检测与重识别的目标冲突问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角监督和自适应损失设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Result: 在12个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中表现优于现有少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督MLLMs方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和适应性，为少样本细粒度视觉分类提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习框架实现了高质量的RGB-D序列生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Result: 实验表明ICM-Fusion能显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion是一种高效的多任务LoRA融合方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

Conclusion: GAVN是一种有效的通用视频修复方法，能够处理多种失真类型。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个包含6300个真实世界模因帖子的数据集，用于改进多模态在线环境中的内容审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体模因常传播有害内容，但数据获取和标注成本高，阻碍了有效的审核系统开发。

Method: 构建了一个两阶段标注的数据集，并提出了一个生成社会相关标签的模块。

Result: 实验表明，加入这些标签显著提升了视觉语言模型在检测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进多模态内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在异常检测中领域适应问题的综合框架，通过多阶段推理和细粒度奖励机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的方法在训练数据利用和推理过程监督方面存在不足，限制了MLLMs在专业异常检测中的应用。

Method: 引入多阶段推理过程（从区域识别到聚焦检查）和细粒度奖励机制（结合分类准确性和定位监督）。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证了性能提升，实现了高精度且高效适应现有标注。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了通用MLLM能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距，适用于检测细微制造缺陷和结构异常。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

TL;DR: U2CLLIE是一个新颖的低光图像增强框架，通过不确定性感知和空间-颜色因果建模，解决了现有方法在极端暗光条件下的梯度消失和噪声主导问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注架构创新，忽略了极端暗光条件下特征表示的内在不确定性，导致模型可靠性和因果推理能力下降。

Method: 框架包含两个关键组件：不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）和分层因果感知框架（LEN、NeCo、AsC），分别用于噪声抑制和因果约束建模。

Result: U2CLLIE在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，表现出鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE通过结合不确定性感知和因果建模，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果和可靠性。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 RPCA 模型存在计算负担大、依赖精细调参和动态场景适应性差的问题，需要一种更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: 通过将松弛的 RPCA 模型展开为结构化网络（BAM、OEM、IRM），并引入 MAM 和 DCPM 模块来优化背景特征保存和目标提取。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，RPCANet++ 在各种成像场景下实现了最先进的性能，并通过可视化和数值测量提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++ 结合了 RPCA 的理论优势和深度网络的效率，为稀疏目标分割设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学MLLMs的训练数据可能包含隐私和错误知识，导致部署后泄露或错误输出，但完全重新训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出MLLMU-Med基准，通过数据生成流程合成隐私数据和错误知识，评估五种遗忘方法。

Result: 现有方法在移除有害知识方面效果有限，显示改进空间。

Conclusion: 为生物医学MLLMs的安全研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Motivation: 现有视频文本VQA方法存在冗余文本实体和隐式关系建模问题，导致准确性和效率受限。

Method: 设计上下文聚合实例收集模块整合视觉、布局和文本信息，利用实例轨迹追踪模块捕捉文本动态演变。

Result: GAT在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率提升3.86%，推理速度比视频大语言模型快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT通过实例导向方法显著提升了视频文本VQA任务的性能，兼具高效和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Motivation: 解决谱聚类中优化过程不连贯和表示能力有限的问题。

Method: 使用单一网络联合学习亲和矩阵构建、谱嵌入和k均值聚类，并引入最优传输监督和正交重参数化技术。

Result: 在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上，BootSC比第二名方法提升了16%的NMI。

Conclusion: BootSC实现了最先进的聚类性能，解决了传统谱聚类的局限性。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定数据集和强化学习，训练成本高且泛化能力差，ViFP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板，通过多轮QA构建有效推理路径，动态分析一致性并引入自适应CoT机制。

Result: 在A-OKVQA等数据集上，ViFP提升准确率5.4%，减少假阳性推理，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViFP通过通用框架和可靠性评估指标VoC，显著提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的动态场景重建方法将静态和动态元素耦合在共享表示中，导致运动泄漏、几何扭曲和时间闪烁。

Method: SplitGaussian将场景表示分解为静态和动态组件，解耦运动建模与背景几何，仅允许动态分支随时间变形。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提高了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频（T2V）生成模型在多对象运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是对象轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重。

Method: 采用分层生成策略，将背景和前景对象分别处理并逐层合成，避免语义冲突。

Result: 实验表明，LayerT2V在多对象场景中表现优异，mIoU和AP50指标分别比现有方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V为多对象运动视频生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Conclusion: PIS3R为3D视觉任务提供了高质量的图像拼接解决方案。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究普遍认为DFT在CSS中表现不佳，容易发生灾难性遗忘，但本文通过实验证明这一假设是错误的，PVMs本身具有抗遗忘能力。

Method: 通过系统实验分析DFT在两种标准数据集（Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K）和两种PVM骨干（ResNet101和Swin-B）下的表现，并提出改进方法DFT*，包括冻结PVM骨干和预分配分类器等策略。

Result: 实验表明，DFT*在性能上优于16种现有CSS方法，同时训练参数和时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: PVMs的抗遗忘能力被低估，DFT*是一种简单高效的CSS方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种高效、鲁棒的点云配准方法，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized

baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for

mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a

while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: LATR通过明确查询角色和利用长度先验，显著提升了时间句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Motivation: DAS技术在不同领域的应用中，由于传感环境的异质性导致数据分布差异，限制了AI模型的跨领域泛化能力，且标记训练数据不足。

Result: 实验表明，VPT-Deep方法在室内步态识别任务中分类准确率达96.94%，仅微调0.322%的参数，优于传统FFT方法，且训练时间减少45%。

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有通用性、高效性和可扩展性，为DAS领域信号识别模型的泛化问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

TL;DR: VisionTS++ 是一种基于视觉模型的时间序列预测方法，通过创新方法解决了跨模态迁移中的三个关键差异，并在多个基准测试中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在时间序列预测中存在数据模态、多变量预测和概率预测三个关键差异，限制了其作为通用时间序列基础模型的潜力。

Method: 提出 VisionTS++，包括基于视觉模型的过滤机制、彩色多变量转换方法和多分位数预测方法，以解决上述差异。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VisionTS++ 取得了最佳性能，MSE 降低了 6%-44%，并在 12 个概率预测设置中 9 次排名第一。

Conclusion: VisionTS++ 为跨模态知识迁移提供了新范式，推动了通用时间序列基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

TL;DR: ProtoN是一个基于图的少样本学习框架，用于耳部生物识别，通过联合处理多个样本和原型节点，显著提高了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳部生物识别在数据稀缺和类内变异性大的情况下表现受限，现有方法难以捕捉一致且具有判别性的特征。

Method: 采用图神经网络（PGNN）处理多样本和原型节点，结合跨图原型对齐策略和混合损失函数。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，ProtoN达到最高99.60%的Rank-1识别准确率和0.025的EER。

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，适用于数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Motivation: 现有建筑改造需要基于LoD3热模型的模拟，但特征识别难以扩展且准确。

Result: 在瑞典住宅建筑测试中，SI3FP的窗墙比估计误差约为5%，适用于早期改造分析。

Conclusion: SI3FP支持大规模能源改造规划，并在城市发展中有广泛应用。

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Motivation: 解决现有MLLMs在视频推理中跨模态交互不足和幻觉问题，提升长视频和复杂推理链的处理能力。

Method: 提出VITAL框架，结合视觉工具箱和多任务数据集（MTVR-CoT-72k和MTVR-RL-110k），并设计DGRPO算法优化多任务强化学习。

Result: 在11个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长视频问答和时间定位任务中超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VITAL通过工具增强和多任务学习显著提升了视频推理能力，为复杂视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Transformer架构在多任务学习中因注意力矩阵规模问题导致计算开销过大，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，计算开销降低了一个数量级，任务性能提升高达7.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务学习中实现了高效计算与性能提升的双重目标。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Result: 在COR127K基准测试中，CORE显著优于现有模型，为细粒度多模态检索研究提供了新方向。

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为对象级检索提供了有效解决方案，推动了多模态检索领域的发展。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Result: LoRA适应方法在仅10%训练数据下接近100%数据可用性的性能，且在未见肿瘤域上表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRA适应方法显著提升基础模型的性能，但传统架构的完全微调仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

Result: 在四个专业任务和四个综合基准测试中表现显著提升，LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-1.5-13B分别平均提升5.4%和4.0%。

Conclusion: CVC任务有效提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力，且无需依赖复杂模型或人工干预。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Result: 实验表明，4DVD在新视角合成和4D生成上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦方法有效生成高质量4D内容，并支持精确的4D表示优化。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法存在两个问题：1) 复杂提示下擦除不彻底（非零对齐残差）；2) 参数更新集中在少数深层导致生成质量下降。

Method: ErasePro引入零残差约束确保目标与锚概念特征完美对齐，并采用渐进式层更新策略，从浅层到深层逐步转移特征。

Result: 在不同概念擦除任务（实例、艺术风格和裸露擦除）中，ErasePro表现出色。

Conclusion: ErasePro实现了更彻底的概念擦除，同时更好地保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Conclusion: QuantVSR通过STCA和LBA模块有效解决了VSR模型量化中的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Result: 在Causal Triplet挑战中，因果增量嵌入在合成和真实世界基准测试中显著优于基线性能。

Conclusion: 因果增量嵌入是提升OOD鲁棒性的有效策略，尤其在干预表示方面表现出色。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

TL;DR: RAIDX是一个结合RAG和GRPO的新型深度伪造检测框架，提高检测准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法缺乏透明度和解释性，RAIDX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RAIDX整合RAG和GRPO，利用外部知识提高准确性，并自动生成细粒度解释和显著性图。

Result: RAIDX在多个基准测试中表现出色，提供可解释的文本和显著性图，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，解决了准确性和解释性的关键问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key
element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer
vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these
methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models
specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive
processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores,
enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in
standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

TL;DR: TopKD是一种简单高效的基于logit的知识蒸馏框架，通过Top-K缩放模块和解耦损失显著提升蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要关注特征级知识转移，忽视了教师模型logit分布中的关键信息。

Method: 提出TopKD框架，包含Top-K缩放模块（TSM）和Top-K解耦损失（TDL），无需额外模块或架构改动。

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有蒸馏方法，尤其在Vision Transformers上表现突出。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的潜力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer通过多尺度特征提取和长程依赖建模，显著提升了PD严重程度评估的准确性。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Result: 在TACoS、ActivityNet Captions和MAD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆方法有效解决了OnVTG任务中的事件建模和长期信息保留问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

TL;DR: TWGTM是首个统一框架，通过双向特征解耦同时解决虚拟试穿（VTON）和虚拟试脱（VTOFF）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将VTON和VTOFF视为独立任务，忽略了它们的互补对称性，TWGTM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双向特征解耦和双条件引导，通过分阶段训练解决掩模依赖不对称问题。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性和竞争力。

Conclusion: TWGTM为服装中心图像合成提供了统一解决方案，展示了双向任务的互补优势。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Conclusion: OMFA为虚拟服装合成提供了一个实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff通过双向反馈机制提升了牙齿对齐的精度，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督条件下显著提升了视听事件定位的准确性，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的幻觉问题，提出了新基准POPEv2，并通过实验发现训练数据中的偏差是主要原因。作者提出了一种轻量级方法Obliviate，有效减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在多模态能力上表现优异，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成的文本与视觉输入不一致。本文旨在系统研究训练数据在幻觉中的作用。

Method: 引入新基准POPEv2，包含从LVLMs训练数据中收集的反事实图像（某些对象被掩码）。通过实验发现训练偏差主要位于语言建模（LM）头部，并提出Obliviate方法，通过轻量级微调策略仅更新LM头部。

Result: Obliviate显著减少了幻觉现象，仅更新约2%的参数，并在不同模型规模和训练数据量下表现出良好的扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 训练数据中的偏差是LVLMs幻觉的主要原因，Obliviate方法通过高效微调LM头部有效缓解了这一问题，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K2Sight框架通过结构化语义监督，将临床概念分解为可解释的视觉属性，显著提升了医学图像中异常定位的性能，同时减少了数据和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像中基于文本描述的异常定位问题，克服通用视觉语言模型在医学领域的不足，同时避免大规模预训练的高成本。

Method: 提出K2Sight框架，利用领域本体将临床概念分解为视觉属性（如形状、密度等），并通过指令式提示指导区域-文本对齐训练。

Result: 仅用1.5%的数据训练的小型模型（0.23B和2B参数）性能媲美或优于7B+医学VLM，mAP50提升达9.82%。

Conclusion: K2Sight通过结构化知识引导，实现了数据高效训练，为医学视觉语言模型提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习框架，用于多类皮肤疾病分类，评估了三种图像预处理技术，并比较了多种预训练模型的性能，最终DinoV2结合RGB预处理表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤疾病分类因类间相似性高、类内变异性大和病变纹理复杂而具有挑战性，需要有效的预处理和模型选择来提升自动化诊断系统的性能。

Method: 研究评估了三种图像预处理技术（标准RGB、CMY色彩空间转换、CLAHE），并比较了预训练的CNN和Transformer模型（DenseNet201、Efficient-NetB5、ViT、Swin Transformer、DinoV2 Large）的性能。

Result: DinoV2结合RGB预处理取得了最高准确率（93%）和F1分数，Grad-CAM可视化进一步验证了其精确的病变定位能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了有效预处理和模型选择在构建鲁棒且可解释的皮肤病CAD系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长序列处理或依赖深度传感器时表现不佳，且测试时优化速度慢。

Method: 将深度估计器集成到RGB-D SLAM系统中，利用3D高斯映射解决几何细节不准确问题，并通过前馈循环预测模块直接推断相机位姿。

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上表现与SplaTAM相当，跟踪时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时，显著提升了效率，适用于实时3D重建。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

TL;DR: OmniDepth通过双向对齐单目和立体深度估计的潜在表示，统一了两者的优势，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目和立体深度估计各有优缺点，但现有方法未能有效结合两者的优势。OmniDepth旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的跨注意力对齐机制，动态同步单目上下文线索与立体假设表示，实现双向对齐。

Result: OmniDepth在Middlebury和ETH3D数据集上零样本泛化误差降低超过40%，并在透明和反射表面等难题上表现优异。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过融合多视角几何与单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN在耳识别中表现出色，但双边耳对称性对CNN学习特征的影响尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发耳侧分类器自动分类左右耳图像，并在训练和测试中纳入侧信息。通过跨数据集评估和消融实验验证方法。

Result: 分开处理左右耳可显著提升性能，消融实验提供了训练CNN耳识别系统的实用见解。

Conclusion: 双边耳对称性对CNN耳识别有重要影响，分开处理左右耳是提升性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解基准测试中的进步未能全面覆盖关键的视觉推理能力。

Method: 引入EncQA基准测试，包含2,076个合成问答对，覆盖6种视觉编码通道和8种分析任务。

Result: 评估9个先进模型发现，性能在不同编码和任务间差异显著，且模型规模不总是提升性能。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解需要针对特定视觉推理差距的策略，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Method: 提出统一框架和VGD分割任务，支持多数据集协同训练。

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics新基准测试中显著优于竞争对手，并支持扩展到多房间估计。

Conclusion: PixCuboid通过优化方法灵活扩展，适用于多房间布局估计，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像扩散模型在资源受限设备上推理时的参数规模问题。

Method: 结合分层位置修剪、位置权重保护和敏感性引导蒸馏三种技术。

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune在保持感知质量的同时，显著优于现有方法，适用于设备端推理。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了提示调优视觉语言模型对弱语义扰动的脆弱性，如细微的图像或文本噪声，这会影响其对新类别的泛化能力。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和噪声扰动的文本嵌入构建弱噪声文本特征，聚类形成噪声提示，并与可学习提示标记结合生成抗噪声提示。此外，计算噪声抵抗视觉提示原型（NRVPP）并引入对齐、鲁棒性和抗噪声目标。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt表现优于现有方法，展现出对语义噪声的更强鲁棒性和对新类别的更好泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过创新的抗噪声提示设计和多目标优化，显著提升了视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI

a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

*Ziyang Leng,Jiawei Yang,Zhicheng Ren,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVCon是一个简单有效的对比学习框架，用于提升自动驾驶中的鸟瞰图（BEV）感知能力，通过两种对比学习模块显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要集中在BEV编码器和任务特定头上，忽视了表示学习的潜力。

Method: BEVCon引入了两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块和视角对比模块，结合检测损失进行密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BEVCon实现了最高2.4%的mAP提升，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充路径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: ST-Occ是一种用于3D占用预测的时空一致性学习框架，通过历史信息的高效存储和不确定性感知的注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空不一致性问题。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包含时空记忆模块和不确定性感知的注意力机制。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中性能提升3 mIoU，时空不一致性降低29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ通过时空依赖性和动态感知，显著提升了3D占用预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MR模拟方法，通过分组等色体减少计算时间，比传统方法快3到72倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MR模拟器假设每个等色体需单独模拟，计算时间长。

Method: 将等色体分组，共享模拟过程中的部分计算，适用于特定梯度类型。

Result: 在FSE和EPI序列中，新方法分别耗时38.1秒和7.1秒，远快于传统方法的208.4秒和66.4秒。

Conclusion: 分组等色体方法显著提高了MR模拟效率。

Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators:
Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the
computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped
isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before
simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a
certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for
ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as
the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field
inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be
combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis
only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed
methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE)
and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed
method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the
cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD)
instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI
sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the
proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds,
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑个体视觉素养差异的注意力模型，Lit2Sal和Sal2Lit，分别用于预测注意力分布和评估视觉素养，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了视觉素养对注意力行为的影响，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过235名参与者的实验数据，提出Lit2Sal和Sal2Lit两个计算模型。

Result: Lit2Sal优于现有显著性模型，Sal2Lit预测视觉素养准确率达86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化可视化设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Accounting for individual differences can improve the effectiveness of
visualization design. While the role of visual attention in visualization
interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this
behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a
235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT,
CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data
exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts
(high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers)
focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models
leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that
predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and
Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data.
Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal
outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware
considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single
attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment
that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to
consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in
literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual
data communication to enhance understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据可视化素养测量中难度层次不明确的问题。

Method: DRIVE-T包括任务项标记、难度评分和Rasch模型分析三步。

Result: 成功构建了基于语义学的测量层次，并通过试点研究验证。

Conclusion: DRIVE-T为数据可视化素养测量提供了有效的层次化方法。

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement
constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may
hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To
mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and
Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed
to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data
vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items
discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data
visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based
items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by
independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores
through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the
emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the
discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data
vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we
show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the
difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct
for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from
semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that
each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T
methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design
phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based
measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the
application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RLGS是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于自动调整3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中的超参数，提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS中的超参数调整需要大量人工且结果不稳定，RLGS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过轻量级策略模块动态调整学习率和密集化阈值等关键超参数，无需修改现有架构。

Result: 在多个3DGS变体和数据集上验证了RLGS的有效性，例如在TNT数据集上将Taming-3DGS的PSNR提高了0.7dB。

Conclusion: RLGS为3DGS训练中的超参数调整提供了一种通用且高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive
and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and
suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning
framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy
modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates
and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly
integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We
demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS
variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness
across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For
example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT)
dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when
baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an
effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS
training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂的相机标定和位姿估计，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用多分支多视图解码架构，结合分支处理、跨视图注意力和分支间融合，并引入D-Normal正则化器优化几何参数。

Result: 在ScanNet++和Replica数据集上达到SOTA性能，具有优秀的泛化能力和效率。

Conclusion: Surf3R高效且无需标定，显著提升了3D一致性和表面细节精度。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera
calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive
pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this
challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that
reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and
completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a
multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference
views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed
branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the
model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring
camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an
explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples
surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D
geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica
datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

Motivation: 改进基于性能的动画，使3D风格化角色的表情更真实且符合感知。

Method: 非实时系统使用3D情感转移网络从2D图像生成3D参数；实时系统通过混合形状适应网络生成几何一致且时间稳定的参数。

Result: 系统在表情识别度、强度和吸引力上显著优于商业产品Faceware。

Conclusion: 该系统可集成到动画流程中，帮助动画师更快速准确地创建所需表情。

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive
believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining
traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning
models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive
character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.
For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes
use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real
time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the
character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally
stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a
commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,
intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters
via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be
implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system
for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的时空约束损失函数（STC），用于地形深度脉冲神经网络（TDSNNs），成功模拟了灵长类视觉皮层的层次空间功能组织，并在计算性能和生物逼真度之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度人工神经网络（ANNs）在模拟视觉皮层地形组织时忽略了时间动态，导致性能下降和生物逼真度不足。

Method: 利用脉冲神经网络（SNNs）和STC损失函数，构建TDSNNs模型，模拟视觉皮层的层次空间功能组织。

Result: TDSNNs在ImageNet任务中性能下降极小（无下降），优于现有地形ANNs，同时在生物逼真度和信息处理效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: TDSNNs为神经科学现象解释和高效深度学习模型设计提供了新框架和见解。

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种重要性感知的多粒度融合模型（IMG），用于视频时刻检索（VMR），动态选择性地融合音频、视觉和文本模态，解决了现有方法忽视音频模态或简单嵌入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VMR方法大多仅关注视觉和文本模态，忽略了音频模态的互补作用。少数尝试融合音频的方法未能区分音频的重要性，导致噪声干扰。

Method: 设计了伪标签监督的音频重要性预测器，动态加权音频以减少噪声干扰；提出多粒度音频融合模块，在局部、事件和全局层次上融合音频与视觉模态；引入跨模态知识蒸馏策略处理推理时音频缺失问题。

Result: 在构建的新数据集Charades-AudioMatter上验证了模型利用音频的能力，实验表明方法在VMR任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: IMG模型通过动态融合多模态信息，显著提升了视频时刻检索的准确性，尤其在音频相关场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically
related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

Motivation: 现有多模态模型依赖一次性诊断方法，缺乏对推理过程的监督，导致多任务CXR诊断中存在推理冗长、奖励稀疏和幻觉频繁等问题。

Method: 提出CX-Mind模型，通过课程强化学习和可验证过程奖励（CuRL-VPR）实现交错的“思考-回答”推理。构建了CX-Set数据集，包含708,473张图像和2,619,148个样本，并生成42,828个高质量交错推理数据点。

Result: CX-Mind在视觉理解、文本生成和时空对齐方面显著优于现有医学和通用领域MLLMs，平均性能提升25.1%。在真实临床数据集（Rui-CXR）上，14种疾病的平均召回率显著优于第二名。

Conclusion: CX-Mind通过可验证的推理过程和高效的诊断性能，展示了在多任务CXR诊断中的临床实用性和优越性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: GlaBoost为青光眼诊断提供了透明且可扩展的解决方案，并可扩展到其他眼科疾病。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Motivation: 现有方法（如低秩近似或局部平滑正则化）存在计算成本高或泛化能力差的问题，需要一种更高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Result: 在图像修复和交通数据补全实验中，LRTuckerRep在高缺失率下表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep是一种高效且鲁棒的多维数据补全方法，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

TL;DR: 提出首个针对多实例学习（MIL）的持续学习方法，通过选择实例并保留数据多样性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室和临床环境数据动态变化，现有持续学习方法在多实例学习中效果不佳，需专门方法。

Method: 基于实例注意力分数和距离选择样本，保留多样性，用于任务间的样本存储。

Result: 在白血病实验室数据上，方法显著优于现有持续学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现MIL的持续学习，适应数据分布变化，如疾病发生或基因改变。

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

Motivation: 解决真实数据难以覆盖高风险、长尾驾驶事件和复杂交互的问题。

Result: 在nuScenes上性能提升50%，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: RoboTron-Sim能有效管理高风险驾驶场景。

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

TL;DR: 提出一种利用自适应光学系统（AO）的计算成像方法，通过控制变形镜产生高频子像素位移图像，联合上采样实现超分辨率成像，同时保持AO系统对大气波前畸变的校正能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决天文望远镜视场（FoV）与图像分辨率之间的权衡问题，利用现有AO系统提升成像质量。

Method: 通过AO系统的变形镜施加学习到的精确波前畸变，生成多幅具有高频子像素位移的图像，联合上采样实现超分辨率。

Result: 实验和仿真显示，信噪比（SNR）提升高达12 dB，且无需硬件修改即可应用于现有望远镜。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效提升望远镜成像分辨率，且易于在实际望远镜中部署。

Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV)
and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is
under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational
imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive
optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use
the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely
controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images
that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then
be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we
show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO
operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront
distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate
end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the
upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal
statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our
experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,
demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO
super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no
hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a
complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily
transferred to an operational telescope. Project webpage:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI工具训练和验证数据的时效性和代表性，同时考虑伦理和治理问题。

Method: 提出自动化框架收集数据，也介绍了半自动化方法。

Result: 框架支持持续更新数据，确保AI工具验证的准确性。

Conclusion: 自动化方法适合大规模长期数据收集，但半自动化方法也可作为起点。

Abstract: In this report a framework for the collection of clinical images and data for
use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is
described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the
images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes
to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and
agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups.
  A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that
it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the
data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in
the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets
have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical
outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old
data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the
imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation
dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and
active now.
  Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated
approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended
for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data
collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are
provided.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal
imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate
ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the
latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the
year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal
approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific
approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion
detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a
variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical
coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models
combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models
pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust
cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision
support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,
and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,
attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing
challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of
interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient
populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that
emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based
reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically
applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Motivation: 视网膜血管分割和动静脉分类对诊断系统性和眼部疾病至关重要，但现有方法将任务视为三个独立的二分类问题，忽略了血管结构的耦合关系。

Method: 设计了Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss以增强血管、动脉和静脉预测的一致性，并引入intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss提取更精细的特征表示。

Result: 在RITE、LES-AV和HRF三个公开数据集上取得了最佳结果。

Conclusion: 通过新的损失函数和正则化方法，显著提升了视网膜动静脉分类的准确性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for
the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying
segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction
of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity,
which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive
retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are
time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional
Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this
challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods
all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary
tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical
structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall
retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it,
we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce
the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions,
avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks.
Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level
contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained
representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been
achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV
and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 早期准确检测骨折对治疗至关重要，但X光片解读耗时且易错，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 改进VGG-19模型，结合CLAHE、Otsu阈值和Canny边缘检测等预处理技术，并使用Grad-CAM提供模型决策的可视化解释。

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.78%，AUC分数为1.00，并通过实时Web应用提供快速诊断反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可靠、快速且可解释的骨折检测解决方案，有助于提高诊断效率和患者护理质量。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating
treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and
outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone
task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of
radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,
typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to
clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated
framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our
needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,
and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to
facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable
AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making
process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the
model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further
clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where
healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic
feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model
attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it
exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable
solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for
diagnoses and better patient care.

Conclusion: 增强视觉语义密度的方法有效提升了医学图像与报告的视觉对齐效果，为多功能医学诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing
multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning
medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high
SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this
paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment
effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level
vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to
differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical
structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling
method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging
VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This
process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in
abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of
abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures
the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate
alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two
chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,
MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across
multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average
AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning
capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for
various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a
non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across
different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the
influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent
literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on
reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the
need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound
shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional
neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal
ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input
images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw
radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach
to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with
different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant
differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,
regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly
improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach
can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed
radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches
could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing
steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable
clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant
potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible
manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency
constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix
with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned
challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data
augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image
Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically
adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for
collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between
labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization
framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between
unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative
feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA
datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/PHPJava666/M3HL

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised classification method using a limited number of
coded acquisitions from a DD-CASSI hyperspectral imager. Based on a simple
model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify
classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of
ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to
evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of
class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the
Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to
detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to
rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised
scenarios.

Motivation: 糖尿病足溃疡的自动分割在临床诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但由于溃疡区域的异质性和复杂背景，传统CNN方法难以建模长距离空间依赖关系。

Method: FUTransUNet结合了Vision Transformers的全局注意力机制和U-Net的精细空间分辨率，通过跳跃连接和解码路径提取全局和局部特征。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role
in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring.
However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance,
irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in
clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as
U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model
long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive
fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that
integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into
the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global
contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through
skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated
FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset.
FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672,
and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice
Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To
ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which
highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes
clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and
local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate,
explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution
for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable,
high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving
real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential
to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep
learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify
images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures
is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some
picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being
utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The
suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how
picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study
specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more
complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when
image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may
learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are
incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend
the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification
accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct
extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms
customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the
trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效AI系统以提升前列腺癌检测的准确性和一致性，减少对专家诊断的依赖。

Method: 使用22,481例MRI数据（来自46个城市的21,288名患者）训练和验证模型，分为内部和外部测试集。

Result: 主要终点是AI与标准诊断的一致性，次要终点包括AUROC分析以评估模型性能。

Conclusion: PI-CAI-2B模型在检测Gleason分级≥2前列腺癌方面具有潜力，需进一步验证其临床实用性。

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective
cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries)
to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient,
next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed
for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the
PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities
in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12
independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used
for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20
external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI,
IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in
Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external
testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in
agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made
by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two
expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and
peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate
cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is
prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard
of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening)
cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived
from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary
measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient
ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

TL;DR: 深度学习模型（LSTM、GRU、RNN）在通过笔迹分析检测阿尔茨海默病时表现不佳，传统集成方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病检测通常依赖昂贵或侵入性方法，本研究探索非侵入性笔迹分析的可行性。

Method: 使用34种笔迹任务数据集，比较三种循环神经网络与传统机器学习模型，重点关注从离散笔画提取的特征。

Result: 循环神经网络特异性低且方差高，传统集成方法在准确性和平衡性上显著优于深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 循环神经网络不适合处理离散笔画特征，研究揭示了数据表示与模型兼容性的关键问题。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive
procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning
can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting
analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from
healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare
three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional
machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the
recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw
temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow
that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they
exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods
significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with
balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for
continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted
from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning
models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural
assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting
data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical
issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable
directions for future research.

TL;DR: UNISELF是一种深度学习方法，用于多发性硬化（MS）病变的自动分割，通过测试时自集成和实例归一化技术，实现了高精度和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在单源有限数据训练时，无法同时优化域内准确性和域外泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用测试时自集成病变融合和测试时实例归一化（TTIN）技术，处理域偏移和缺失输入对比度。

Result: 在ISBI 2015测试数据集上表现优异，并在多个域外测试数据集（如MICCAI 2016和UMCL）上超越基准方法。

Conclusion: UNISELF在MS病变分割中实现了高精度和强泛化能力，适用于多源数据场景。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast
magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared
to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving
state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to
simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization
when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has
been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF,
which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while
demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test
datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to
improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization
(TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts.
Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training
dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test
dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the
same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain
shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL
datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit
domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition
protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect
acquisition. Our code is available at https://github.com/uponacceptance.

TL;DR: PET2Rep是一个专门用于PET图像报告生成的大规模基准数据集，填补了现有基准在代谢信息方面的空白，并评估了30种前沿视觉语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在医学领域的应用主要集中在结构成像模态，而分子PET成像的独特特性被忽视，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入PET2Rep数据集，包含全身图像-报告对，覆盖多个器官，并设计了一系列临床效率指标来评估报告质量。

Result: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在PET报告生成任务上表现不佳，远未满足实际需求。

Conclusion: PET2Rep为PET报告生成提供了首个专用数据集，并揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来医学应用的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and
neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic
metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging
technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet
their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent
advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in
medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report
generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have
predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique
characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To
bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET
images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report
generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body
image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in
existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In
addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce
a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer
uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a
head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and
medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art
VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short
of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency
that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

Motivation: 解决肺部疾病研究中标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用5000多张CT扫描预训练MAE，并在下游分类任务中微调。

Result: MAE能有效提取临床相关特征，提升诊断性能。

Conclusion: MAE在缺乏大规模标注数据时仍能有效工作。

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative
feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung
disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage
this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed
tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans
from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as
COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a
downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our
findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful
features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale
labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here:

Method: 采用标准UNet架构和场分解策略，构建大规模全身CT数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在内部数据集上优于基线方法，外部数据集上表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: TotalRegistrator展示了在多器官配准中的高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal
and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing
methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their
generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents
TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple
anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a
novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only
11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we
constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body
(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at
different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic
classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image
registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated
our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal
datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal
dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house
dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in
multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment
performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results
compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those
tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability. The source code will be publicly

Conclusion: 该框架支持个体化发育评估，具有实时性能，适用于研究和临床。代码已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for
studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due
to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates
of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a
standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and
comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common
coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework
for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal
brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model
with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219
neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method
achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with
sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.
Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed
neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the
maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized
developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,
supporting both research and clinical applications. The model code is available

Motivation: 心房颤动（AF）治疗需要个性化消融治疗，而患者特异性心脏数字孪生模型依赖于对健康组织和瘢痕组织的准确分割。

Method: LA-CaRe-CNN是一个两阶段的3D CNN级联模型，第一阶段预测左心房，第二阶段结合原始图像信息细化瘢痕组织预测。通过强化的数据增强应对域偏移。

Result: 模型在左心房分割上达到89.21% DSC和1.6969 mm ASSD，瘢痕组织分割上达到64.59% DSC和91.80% G-DSC。

Conclusion: LA-CaRe-CNN的分割结果对生成患者特异性心脏数字孪生模型和个性化消融治疗具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac
arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation
therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to
prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,
however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred
tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic
resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading
Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium
as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage
CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a
prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction
with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial
scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during
training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the
diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold
ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm
ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more
challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through
LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation
therapy to treat AF.

Result: 实验表明PLA能高效攻击黑盒T2I模型的安全机制，成功率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLA在黑盒设置下有效绕过T2I模型的安全机制，展示了其潜在风险。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在缺乏人类标注的新颖和专用软件中表现不佳，需要一种自主进化的解决方案。

Method: SEAgent通过体验学习（包括探索、试错和任务生成）更新代理策略，设计了世界状态模型和课程生成器，并采用专家到通用训练策略。

Result: 在OS-World的五个新软件环境中，SEAgent的成功率从11.3%提升到34.5%，显著优于UI-TARS。

Conclusion: SEAgent通过自主进化和任务生成，显著提升了CUA在新软件环境中的性能，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖潜在嵌入和多模态融合，缺乏可解释性且需要强监督。

Result: 在Ref-AVSBench和R²-AVSBench上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: TGS-Agent通过显式推理和分解任务流程，提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at

Motivation: 高频无线链路通常依赖视距通信，视觉数据可帮助预测信道动态并克服障碍。

Method: 通过多智能体方法将实时无线电和视频感知信息传递给O-RAN xApps，并引入新的视频功能生成阻塞信息。

Result: 实验显示感知信息延迟低于1毫秒，xApp能成功实时控制RAN。

Conclusion: 该架构实现了集成感知与通信，为5G/6G RAN提供了实时控制能力。

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved independently. With the
emergence of high-frequency wireless links operating mostly in line-of-sight,
visual data can help predict the channel dynamics by detecting obstacles and
help overcoming them through beamforming or handover techniques.
  This paper proposes a novel architecture for delivering real-time radio and
video sensing information to O-RAN xApps through a multi-agent approach, and
introduces a new video function capable of generating blockage information for
xApps, enabling Integrated Sensing and Communications. Experimental results
show that the delay of sensing information remains under 1\,ms and that an xApp
can successfully use radio and video sensing information to control the 5G/6G
RAN in real-time.

### [172] [ZARA: Zero-shot Motion Time-Series Analysis via Knowledge and Retrieval Driven LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04038)
*Zechen Li,Baiyu Chen,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZARA是一个基于代理的零样本、可解释的人类活动识别（HAR）框架，直接从原始运动时间序列中工作，无需微调或特定任务分类器，实现了最先进的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HAR方法需要针对固定活动集进行训练，且在新行为或传感器设置出现时需要昂贵重新训练；基于LLM的方法准确率低且缺乏可验证的解释性。

Method: ZARA通过自动生成的特征知识库、多传感器检索模块和分层代理流程，指导LLM迭代选择特征并生成预测和自然语言解释。

Result: 在8个HAR基准测试中，ZARA的零样本性能超过最强基线2.53倍（宏F1），并提供了清晰的推理过程。

Conclusion: ZARA是迈向可信赖、即插即用运动时间序列分析的有希望的一步，其模块化设计通过消融研究验证了必要性。

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

TL;DR: MedCheck是一个针对医疗基准测试的生命周期评估框架，旨在解决现有基准测试在临床保真度、数据管理和安全性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）医疗基准测试存在可靠性问题，缺乏临床实践关联、数据完整性和安全性评估。

Method: MedCheck将基准测试开发分为五个连续阶段，并提供46项医学定制标准，用于评估53个医疗LLM基准测试。

Result: 分析揭示了系统性问题，如与临床实践脱节、数据污染风险以及忽视模型稳健性和不确定性意识等安全关键维度。

Conclusion: MedCheck可作为诊断工具和行动指南，推动医疗AI评估的标准化、可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

*Nima Iji,Kia Dashtipour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain of Questions (CoQ)的框架，通过动态生成问题引导多模态语言模型选择性地激活相关感官模态，从而提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在推理能力上的进步尚未完全适用于多模态环境，模型需要主动决定使用哪些感官模态（如视觉、听觉或空间感知）来应对复杂现实场景。

Method: 采用好奇心驱动的推理方法，动态生成关于环境的问题，引导模型选择性激活相关模态以收集关键信息。

Result: 在整合多个数据集的新多模态基准测试中，CoQ方法显著提升了基础模型识别和整合感官信息的能力，提高了准确性、可解释性和任务对齐性。

Conclusion: CoQ框架通过动态问题生成有效提升了多模态语言模型的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.
