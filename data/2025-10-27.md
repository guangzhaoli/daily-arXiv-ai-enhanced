### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素建立快捷路径，防止目标属性与偶然因素的纠缠，提升生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法在捕捉特定目标属性时，容易将目标属性与姿态、表情、光照等偶然因素纠缠在一起，限制了模型的泛化能力和对文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 在适配器训练过程中，为混淆因素（如姿态、表情等）建立辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA）作为快捷路径，消除适配器学习这些因素的动机，训练完成后移除辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入任务中，该方法显著提升了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个通用设计原则：在寻求解耦表示时，最有效的途径可能是为不应学习的内容建立快捷路径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过将参考视频作为语义提示，结合冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和Mixture-of-Transformers专家，实现了统一的语义控制视频生成，在零样本泛化能力上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化的语义控制难题，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP将问题重新定义为上下文生成，利用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过plug-and-play的Mixture-of-Transformers专家引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到新SOTA，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，与领先的条件特定商业模型相当，并构建了VAP-Data数据集（100K配对视频，100个语义条件）。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成的重要进展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，通过焦点调制注意力和双向特征融合模块提升医学图像分割性能，在八个公开数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多种尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: FM-BFF-Net网络结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度特征的高效交互。

Result: 在八个公开数据集（包括息肉检测、皮肤病变分割和超声成像）上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越最新最先进方法。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过结合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效提升了边界精度和对病变尺寸、形状、对比度变化的鲁棒性，适用于多样化的医学成像场景。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GenPT生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配和最佳优先搜索策略处理视频点跟踪中的多模态不确定性，在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前判别式模型在点跟踪中遇到视觉遮挡和外观变化时，只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹分布。

Method: 使用流匹配公式结合迭代细化、窗口相关先验和点坐标方差调度，训练生成式点跟踪器；推理时采用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA，可见点跟踪保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡条件下的跟踪性能，同时保持可见点的跟踪精度。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个3D医学图像基础推理数据集3DReasonKnee，包含494k个高质量五元组，用于评估视觉语言模型在3D膝关节MRI上的定位和诊断推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这限制了模型输出与临床诊断工作流程的对齐，阻碍了可信赖的临床AI协作。

Method: 构建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估基准，对5个最先进的视觉语言模型进行了基准测试，为3D医学图像的基础推理提供了性能基线。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

### [6] [Thermal Polarimetric Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20972)
*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料特性，通过长波红外偏振成像避免可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法受限于光照条件和材料特性，无法有效处理透明、半透明和异质物体。热偏振成像具有独立于光照和材料特性的优势，可以克服这些限制。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，利用长波红外偏振成像技术，通过多视角热偏振图像来恢复详细的3D形状。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了新的有效途径，特别是在处理传统方法难以处理的物体类型时表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的对象中心自监督适应方法，用于视觉基础模型的无标注域适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺的领域表现不佳，监督微调不可行，而自监督学习在视觉编码器模型中效果不佳

Method: 使用多视角对象中心视频进行自监督微调，基于自蒸馏范式，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术

Result: 在2个数据集上对3个视觉基础模型进行实验，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法表现一致提升

Conclusion: VESSA能够有效适应新领域而无需标注，利用多视角对象观察学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用管道，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境（如杂乱、光照差、复杂背景）下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决域偏移和背景干扰问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，结合低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出的误报，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试中，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时带来可忽略的推理开销。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中具有有效性和实用性，能够显著改善未见物体的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的自动化结构损伤评估方法，利用YOLOv11模型检测混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋和裂缝，实现震后快速损伤评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 震后结构完整性评估对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，需要快速检测混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋来评估损伤程度

Method: 使用2023年土耳其地震后收集的图像数据集，通过数据增强和微调优化YOLOv11模型，开发混合框架检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，并分类损伤等级

Result: 建立了能够自动识别建筑物内外结构组件、检测损伤特征并可靠确定损伤等级的深度学习系统

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在不同损伤场景下实现快速自动化的震后损伤检测

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何定位，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视图设置，不支持增量更新，缺乏3D空间的几何定位，这些限制使得它们不适用于具身智能场景。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其定位到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕捉空间和语义关系以及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为下游机器人应用提供了实用的3D场景理解解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg提出了一种新颖的解码器架构，通过联合优化空间和小波域的特征细化，结合高频先验和Mamba注意力机制，在语义分割任务中实现了更好的细节保持和语义上下文平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，而解码器设计过于简单，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保持之间的权衡不佳。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从输入图像学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）使用双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）开发频谱分解注意力（SDA）块利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模；4）应用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性评估中都优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过结合小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在语义分割任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了联合优化空间和小波域特征的有效性。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念的视觉语言模型框架，用于赫希施普龙病肠肌层神经丛分类，相比传统CNN模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠肌层神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要结合临床专业知识提升模型的相关性和透明度。

Method: 基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示词，使用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在准确率（83.9%）、精确率（86.6%）和特异性（87.6%）上均优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，结合专家知识能产生更符合临床需求的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光照图像增强，相比现有方法在保持图像质量的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Retinex方法在大尺寸图像上处理速度较慢，需要一种更高效的低光照图像增强方法。

Method: 将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建两级优化模型，通过迭代求解光照和反射直方图，最后通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: 在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒处理时间，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒，同时在可见性和性能指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HistRetinex方法在保持增强效果的同时大幅提升了处理效率，为实时低光照图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理（AVR）任务，扩展了视觉推理到部分可观测的交互环境，需要智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的视觉推理主要局限于静态、完全可观测的设置，而现实世界中信息往往因遮挡或有限视野而不完整。人类通过主动探索环境来获取信息，这种能力启发了本研究。

Method: 开发了CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链注释。基于此构建了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在马尔可夫决策过程中实现不确定性识别、信息增益预测和动作选择。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理（OpenEQA、RoboVQA）和被动视觉推理（GeoMath、Geometry30K）任务上达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLMs虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在主动获取和整合信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是解决现实世界信息不完整性的关键方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样通过交互主动获取信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市尺度LiDAR数据的对象级变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点面ICP对齐、检测置信度校准、语义实例分割和类别约束二分图匹配，实现高精度变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSM差分和图像方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角变化敏感，且缺乏对象标识；基于点云和体素的神经网络方法内存需求大、需要完美预对齐、易损坏薄结构且难以处理分割合并情况。

Method: 使用多分辨率NDT和点面ICP进行时序对齐，通过配准协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测置信度，结合几何代理、语义实例分割和类别约束二分图匹配进行跨时期关联，采用分块处理控制内存使用。

Result: 在15个Subiaco街区上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，优于Triplet KPConv方法，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理城市尺度LiDAR数据中的对象级变化检测，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度检测，特别在部分重叠和采样变化情况下表现稳定。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

TL;DR: 提出Controllable-LPMoE方法，通过动态控制局部先验来微调冻结的基础模型，减少可训练参数的同时提升细粒度感知能力，在多个二元对象分割任务上优于31种SOTA方法。

Motivation: 大规模基础模型在下游分割任务中需要全参数微调，计算开销大；现有方法通过嵌入可训练提示但缺乏语义先验，限制了模型适应性。

Method: 构建轻量级动态混合局部先验提取器，通过异构卷积捕获多样局部先验，使用门控网络动态输出专家先验；设计双向交互适配器，采用余弦对齐可变形注意力和通道自适应尺度增强来交互和重组冻结与可训练特征。

Result: 在多个二元对象分割任务上的实验验证了方法的优越性，相比31种SOTA方法表现出优异的分割性能。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE通过动态先验微调范式，实现了高效微调并提升了分割性能，展示了良好的任务适应性。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的对比图像对，为图像安全评估提供细粒度基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法区分导致安全问题的具体特征，难以系统研究图像安全

Method: 利用图像编辑模型生成对比图像对，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征来翻转安全标签，构建包含3020张图像、9个安全类别的基准

Result: 该基准能有效评估视觉语言模型区分细微图像差异的能力，并作为数据增强策略提升轻量级防护模型的训练效率

Conclusion: SafetyPairs为研究细粒度图像安全差异提供了首个系统性资源，在模型评估和训练优化方面具有重要价值

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过向视觉输入注入可控噪声来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架建模优势估计过程，显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用CoT推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够增强探索和稳健优势估计的方法。

Method: 提出NoisyGRPO框架，包含两个核心组件：(1) 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声以鼓励更广泛的视觉场景探索；(2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，结合噪声先验和轨迹奖励似然来计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的强化学习设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效解决了多模态强化学习中的泛化问题，为提升MLLMs的推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，以降低碘对比剂的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是对高危患者。研究旨在开发一种无需对比剂的替代方法。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描进行训练和验证。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现优异（MAE: 156.28-165.12, PSNR: 20.27-20.71, SSIM: 0.98），在下游任务中血管分割和量化指标显著改善。

Conclusion: DCCTPA方法有效增强了血管可视化，特别是在小血管方面，为高危患者提供了安全的替代方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)框架，用于在基础模型中集成和评估视觉空间智能，通过网格化结构编码物体布局和空间关系，相比传统VQA方法能更准确衡量模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型评估视觉空间智能(VSI)主要依赖文本提示和VQA评分，这种方法掩盖了几何信息、容易产生语言捷径，且无法准确归因于真正的空间技能。

Method: 开发了Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)结构化网格模式，显式编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理先验知识，作为文本的补充通道，为基础模型推理提供忠实、组合式的场景结构表示。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都获得了更一致、更稳定和更全面的提升。同时发布了SIGBench基准数据集，包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIG标注和人类注视轨迹。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面具有重要价值，能够有效分离空间能力与语言先验的影响。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，通过将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的小型速度块建模，从而提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: BFM框架将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块能够基于预训练表示进行条件生成；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略来降低推理成本。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256数据集上的实验表明，BFM在可比生成性能下实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速，显著优于现有Flow Matching方法。

Conclusion: BFM通过块状设计和语义特征引导，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了推理效率，为Flow Matching方法建立了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个针对异常检测的token-wise适应框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间来实现细粒度异常学习，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP适应方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉变化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将token-agnostic文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个token到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划以专门化不同视觉区域的子空间。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态token-wise对齐机制，有效提升了异常检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，支持难度可控的全面能力测试。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新方法，用于生成高质量艺术家风格的3D网格，通过并行生成和拓扑约束实现高效准确的网格生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，解决了3DGS在视觉语言导航中缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但在视觉语言导航中缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在模拟到现实应用中的有效性。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含两个组件：(1)面向对象的语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度注释；(2)物理感知执行连接，将碰撞对象嵌入3DGS并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 构建了InteriorGS数据集（包含1K对象标注的3DGS室内场景数据）和SAGE-Bench基准（首个基于3DGS的VLN基准，包含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但具有强泛化性，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上将基线性能提升了31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，为视觉语言导航提供了更真实的模拟环境，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: FineRS是一个两阶段的多模态大语言模型强化学习框架，用于在高分辨率图像中联合推理和分割极小的物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位小物体方面面临挑战。

Method: 采用粗到细的管道，包括全局语义探索（GSE）和局部感知细化（LPR）。GSE执行指令引导的推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域，LPR细化该区域生成精确的边界框和分割掩码。通过定位知情的回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上始终优于最先进的多模态大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中处理小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的分割和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，通过距离编码器和模态特定解码器建立神经元-概念关联，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上验证了VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面的优越能力

Conclusion: VL-SAE能够通过概念级对齐来理解和增强视觉-语言表示，提升零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务性能

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN训练学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM能够预测下游信号活性、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动状态间的形态动态转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动了3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别准确率，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义感知增强了跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，同时提供了灵活的速度-精度权衡方案，适用于不同计算资源的部署场景。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用人类注视信号增强VLM在现实场景中的预测能力奠定了基础，如辅助机器人和人机协作

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++网络和新的IMPACT-Synth感知损失函数，比较了两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT），发现IMPACT配准能提供更准确的解剖对齐，但评估时存在配准偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型，通过解剖一致的配准来提高结构保真度。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++网络（ResNet-34编码器），结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失，采用AdamW优化器，进行跨解剖区域联合训练和微调，评估两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT）。

Result: 在本地测试集上，IMPACT配准实现了更准确的对齐和更低的MAE，但在公共验证集上，Elastix配准模型得分更高，反映了评估管道的配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，IMPACT配准有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用固定数量的去噪步骤生成高保真图像，但在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽需要大量压缩，导致纹理丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，将扩散模型条件化为基于可用带宽的目标质量水平，使用轻量级质量嵌入指导去噪轨迹，最小化架构改动。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的早期停止方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的框架，能够自适应地识别图像相关的概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念学习，超越了传统预定义概念的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅限于少数预定义的概念轴（如颜色、形状），且多在合成数据集上验证，无法适应真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略，自适应识别图像相关概念轴；通过通用概念编码器将视觉特征绑定到发现的概念轴；优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了优越的编辑能力，能够处理无法手动预定义的多样化真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方面优于现有方法，为语言引导的视觉概念学习提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/whieya/Language-grounded-VCL.

Motivation: 现有方法在合成具有关节结构的3D物体时，难以同时保证几何一致性和外观真实性，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在不足。

Method: 联合建模部件几何和关节动力学，将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间；训练潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样；引入关节感知高斯解码器处理可见性变化。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节3D物体合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [42] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于图像恢复CNN的查表实现方法，通过引入各向异性池化策略（广义中值池化和数据相关池化系数）来替代传统平均池化，以更好地处理各向异性信号结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于查表的CNN图像恢复方法采用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块，但这种方法不适用于各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出了两种各向异性池化方法：广义中值池化和数据相关池化系数学习，使不同方向的像素块能够自适应地贡献权重。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，该方法在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的基于查表的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查表的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，特别是在处理各向异性信号时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用连续双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理时间和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模3D对象和场景的层次结构时存在显著限制：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度级别的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭集离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样化和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: OpenHype利用双曲几何的特性，在连续双曲潜在空间中表示场景层次结构，自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面表现出卓越的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: 通过使用双曲几何，OpenHype能够有效建模3D场景的层次结构，解决了现有方法的局限性，为自主代理提供了更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆的在线评分队列方案MoniTor，用于无训练的视频异常检测，利用预训练视觉语言模型和LSTM机制实现实时异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要集中在离线场景，而在线视频异常检测由于实时性约束和计算强度很少受到关注，需要解决在线VAD的固有复杂性。

Method: MoniTor采用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM网络启发的预测机制来建模时间依赖性，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的实验表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练就能与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor是一种有效的在线视频异常检测解决方案，通过利用预训练大模型和创新的记忆机制，在实时性和准确性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

TL;DR: VidSplice通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务（多帧一致图像修复和掩码区域运动传播），引入空间帧先验和CoSpliced模块，提升了视频修复的时空稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，忽视时空稳定性，对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 将视频修复分解为多帧一致图像修复和掩码区域运动传播；设计CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播；引入上下文控制器模块注入拼接视频到I2V生成主干。

Result: VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中达到竞争性性能，显著提升前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在视频修复任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了CXR-LanIC框架，通过任务对齐的模式发现解决胸部X光诊断中深度学习模型的黑盒问题，实现既准确又可解释的医疗AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中的黑盒问题，为临床医生提供透明、可验证的解释，以增强对自动化诊断的信任并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 基于BiomedCLIP诊断分类器训练转码器稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器的集成模型，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: CXR-LanIC在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确率，同时通过20-50个可解释模式提供透明归因，每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现出一致的激活行为。

Conclusion: 该研究表明医疗AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署，关键创新在于从针对特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,

paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of

performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号处理原理的方法来分析注意力头在语义和视觉属性上的专业化模式，并发现只需编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地控制模型输出中的目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在多种任务上表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。研究旨在理解文本生成模型中单个注意力头如何专门化处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了注意力头级别的专业化一致模式。编辑仅1%的注意力头就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和大规模生成模型的编辑提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练单模态模型并仅学习小型跨注意力桥接器来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态系统需要大量参数训练，而Foley Control旨在保持强大边际分布的同时，用更少的可训练参数实现竞争性的时间和语义对齐。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本跨注意力后插入紧凑的视频跨注意力，使用视频令牌池化减少内存需求。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现竞争力，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于视频到Foley生成，其桥接设计还可扩展到其他音频模态（如语音）。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化层级从步骤级提升到块级，解决了GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中存在两个关键局限：优势归因不准确，以及忽略了生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'来捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，并在块级别优化策略。同时引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景，能够有效提升文本到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的系统，通过多尺度层次混合、自适应关键令牌门控和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，在UAVDark135基准测试中比现有方法性能提升5.9%精度、5.4%归一化精度和4.2%AUC，同时保持81FPS实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、复杂背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态对象信息等问题。

Method: MATrack系统包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列跟踪的稳定性。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法高出5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，处理速度达到81FPS。在实际无人机平台测试中验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为关键机器人应用（如夜间搜救和边境巡逻）提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，解决了现有方法在真实无人机系统中的局限性。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个新颖的两阶段文本图像超分辨率框架，采用"文本优先，图像后处理"的范式，通过解耦字形恢复和图像增强来解决传统方法在文本可读性和图像质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。需要一种能够同时保持高图像质量和文本可读性的解决方案。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：首先重建精确的文本结构（字形恢复），然后使用这些结构来指导后续的全图像超分辨率处理（图像增强）。这种从字形到图像的引导确保了高保真度和视觉一致性。

Result: 实验表明TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在增强文本可读性的同时保持了整体图像质量。作者还贡献了UltraZoom-ST数据集，这是第一个具有极端放大倍率（×14.29）的场景文本数据集。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本和图像处理，成功打破了传统超分辨率方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，为文本图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving

TL;DR: 本文提出两种深度学习模型（ANN和CNN）用于自动检测MEG记录中的癫痫发作间期尖波，通过交互式机器学习策略提高数据标注质量，在临床实践中表现出良好的鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物难治性癫痫的术前评估中，MEG记录的癫痫发作间期尖波手动检测耗时且易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床实践，需要开发更实用的自动检测工具。

Method: 提出基于特征的人工神经网络和卷积神经网络两种架构，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，在59名患者数据库上进行训练和评估。

Result: 两种模型在10名保留测试患者上的表现均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在处理复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法为快速数据标注提供了潜力，所提模型是自动检测癫痫发作间期尖波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性目标检测面临像素级标注成本高的问题，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，结合扩散模型和DINO-v3特征提取标签；采用迭代生成框架优先生成挑战性类别；提出简化的多掩码解码器处理检测中的模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化上实现20-50%的错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能够有效解决显著性目标检测中的数据限制问题，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align是一个轻量级的跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑技术解决资源受限场景下模型过自信和性能下降的问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限场景中，现有跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）面临数据质量差、样本模糊或弱相关导致的过自信和性能下降问题，传统对比学习方法会加剧这一现象。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入可控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（在嵌入空间校准相似度分布），共同降低过自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅使用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间即可获得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在视觉质量上有所提升，但仍然存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，这些问题破坏了3D场景的真实感。需要将几何约束融入深度学习模型来提升空间一致性。

Method: 采用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极几何约束来对齐扩散模型。该方法不需要端到端的可微分性，能够高效地强制执行几何原理，并在静态场景和动态相机下进行训练以确保高质量的测量。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，能够有效解决相机轨迹不稳定和几何伪影问题，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，能够在生成空间一致视频的同时不牺牲视觉质量。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法尝试混合不同域数据进行MAE预训练，但学习到的先验知识可能与下游3D点云分析任务不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DAP-MAE方法，包含异构域适配器（预训练阶段使用适应模式，微调阶段使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，DAP-MAE在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够自适应整合跨域知识，有效解决点云数据稀缺问题，在多个点云分析任务中实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过动态调整蒸馏策略，有效提升了知识蒸馏性能，验证了适应学生模型学习进程的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，能够自动识别突触类型而不需要预先指定类型数量

Conclusion: 该方法为选择覆盖突触结构范围的ground-truth提供了一种原则性方法，优于需要预先知道类型数量的传统监督方法

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取斑块级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略生成玻片级特征，训练多种机器学习分类器进行评估。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归模型达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学显著性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展的有效方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致问题，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多面向对象而限制场景级生成应用。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：(1)数据筛选管道提取高质量场景块进行训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在大型3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到SOTA性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 结果突显了WorldGrow构建大规模虚拟环境的能力以及在构建未来世界模型方面的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Motivation: 生态学研究中计算机视觉应用滞后，主要原因是缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任。作者希望通过后验解释方法为预测提供证据，并记录野外部署的重要限制

Method: 使用Glacier Bay国家公园的航空图像训练Faster R-CNN检测海豹，应用多种后验解释方法：梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法

Result: 解释方法集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非背景，移除海豹会降低检测置信度。分析还发现了系统错误源，如海豹与黑冰和岩石的混淆

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性相结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计、支持决策的保护监测工具

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在不需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置，在三个经典几何问题上取得良好效果

Conclusion: 图像空间为近似困难几何问题提供了通用实用框架，为处理更广泛几何任务开辟了新途径

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中稳定性-可塑性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在梯度计算昂贵或不切实际的场景下。

Method: 提出ZO-FC方法：在单个基于适配器的PEFT模块应用ZO优化，同时保持分类器使用FO优化，以利用ZO的稳定性优势并保留FO的适应性。

Result: ZO优化自然导致更平坦的损失景观，减少CL中的遗忘，但会降低可塑性。ZO-FC方法在稳定性和可塑性之间实现了有效平衡，为设备端CL提供了实用的内存高效解决方案。

Conclusion: ZO优化是持续学习中有前景的方向，ZO-FC方法通过巧妙的模块化设计解决了ZO优化的局限性，为内存受限环境下的CL应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整混合策略即可实现多种解耦任务，具有通用性和灵活性，为解耦表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable

TL;DR: ProtoEEG-kNN是一个可解释的癫痫样放电检测模型，通过案例推理实现高精度检测并提供可视化解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在癫痫样放电检测中虽然准确率高但缺乏可解释性，医生无法理解模型推理过程从而难以纠正错误预测

Method: ProtoEEG-kNN采用基于案例的推理方法，通过比较输入EEG与训练集中相似EEG来进行检测，并可视化展示放电形态和空间分布的解释

Result: 模型在IED检测上达到最先进准确率，且专家更偏好其提供的解释方式

Conclusion: ProtoEEG-kNN实现了高精度与可解释性的平衡，改善了人机交互，有助于医生更好地理解和信任模型预测

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even
trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners
to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning
algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are
uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to
understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify
incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the
human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable
model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons
by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually
demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial
distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over
existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发具身AI代理需要可扩展的训练环境，平衡内容多样性和物理精度。现有的视频方法缺乏实时物理反馈，而物理引擎则受限于手动创建资产的高成本。

Method: 通过单张图像生成具有精确几何、对齐纹理和真实物理材质的3D资产，这些资产可直接集成到物理引擎中，并支持扩展到完整场景生成。

Result: 系统生成的资产可直接用于机器人操作和仿真训练，提供了可扩展的仿真就绪内容创建能力。

Conclusion: Seed3D 1.0为推进基于物理的世界仿真器提供了基础，解决了仿真环境可扩展性的关键挑战。

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that
balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such
environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate
diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning,
while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability
limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a
foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images,
addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike
existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate
geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials.
These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal
configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation
training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene
generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling
scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation
for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用机器学习方法通过超声组织搏动成像自动检测创伤性脑损伤患者的颅内出血，在资源受限环境中提供便携式诊断方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT和MRI诊断颅内出血存在成本高、可用性差等问题，特别是在资源受限环境中。需要开发便携、低成本的替代诊断方法。

Method: 使用超声TPI信号，采用z-score标准化和PCA降维，系统评估多种分类算法在三种特征表示下的性能。

Result: PCA变换显著提升分类器性能，集成方法达到98.0%准确率和0.890的F1分数，有效平衡了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基于机器学习的便携超声设备检测颅内出血的可行性，适用于急诊、农村医疗和军事等传统成像不可用的场景。

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000
TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities
including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have
significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure
dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study
investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using
Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring
tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze
ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with
recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed
ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining
components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate
multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural
network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations:
original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.
Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier
performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of
0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance.
These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH
detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications
in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where
traditional imaging is unavailable.

TL;DR: 本研究使用眼动追踪技术评估边界框高亮显示对胸部X光片解读过程的影响，发现边界框显示会改变放射科医生的视觉搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机辅助检测系统在胸部X光片中广泛使用，但边界框等高亮显示可能影响阅读过程，需要量化评估其对视觉搜索的具体影响。

Method: 从VinDR-CXR数据集中选取180张胸部X光片，3名放射科医生分别在有/无边界框条件下解读病例，使用眼动仪记录眼动数据，分析解读时间、首次注视病灶时间等指标。

Result: 边界框显示延长了解读时间4.9秒，增加了病灶注视时间1.3秒和总注视路径长度2076像素，肺野覆盖率提高10.5%，首次注视病灶时间减少1.3秒。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪技术能够捕捉边界框显示引起的视觉搜索行为改变，支持该方法可行性，需要更大规模研究确认效果并探索跨模态和临床环境的影响。

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest
radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as
bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot
study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which
aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180
chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary
nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall
display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and
1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with
BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements
were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time,
time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path
length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear
mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as
random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives
(n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s
(p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path
length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio
increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced
by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in
search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph
interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and
highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore
implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于集成学习的脑膜瘤分割方法，结合三种不同架构的模型，在有限硬件条件下实现竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑膜瘤是最常见的原发性脑肿瘤，准确分割对治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习方法计算需求大、训练时间长，限制了在硬件受限环境下的应用

Method: 集成三种架构：基础SegResNet模型、带注意力机制和连接跳跃连接的SegResNet、带注意力门控跳跃连接的双解码器U-Net(DDUNet)，每个模型仅训练20个epoch

Result: 在BraTS-MEN 2025数据集上，增强肿瘤(ET)、肿瘤核心(TC)和全肿瘤(WT)的平均病变级Dice分数分别为77.30%、76.37%和73.9%

Conclusion: 集成学习在有限硬件约束下仍能有效进行脑肿瘤分割，为脑膜瘤诊断提供了实用且易用的工具

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了城市空中交通（UAM）车辆中自主导航和着陆系统的漏洞，重点关注针对深度学习模型（如CNN）的木马攻击，实验显示木马攻击导致准确率从96.4%大幅下降至73.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市空中交通系统的发展，自主导航和着陆系统的安全性变得至关重要。木马攻击可能通过训练数据中的隐蔽触发器导致特定条件下的系统故障，这对UAM系统的安全运行构成严重威胁。

Method: 使用DroNet框架评估城市自主空中车辆（UAAV）的脆弱性，收集自定义数据集并训练模型以模拟真实世界条件，同时开发了专门用于识别木马感染模型的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，木马攻击对UAM系统造成显著影响，模型在干净数据上的准确率为96.4%，而在受木马攻击触发数据上的准确率下降至73.3%，显示出明显的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了木马攻击对UAM系统构成的潜在安全风险，为未来研究增强UAM系统韧性奠定了基础，强调了需要开发更强大的安全防护机制来应对此类威胁。

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种物理信息深度学习输入函数预测模型（PIDLIF），用于从小鼠PET图像中直接估计动脉输入函数，通过在训练中结合动力学建模损失来提高模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动力学建模需要准确测定动脉输入函数（AIF），但这种方法耗时且具有侵入性。现有深度学习方法虽然能直接预测输入函数，但在图像质量退化时性能会下降。

Method: 使用物理信息深度学习框架，结合两组织室模型（心肌和脑区），在70个小鼠[18F]FDG动态PET图像数据集上训练，通过物理约束损失函数增强模型对运动模糊等图像退化的鲁棒性。

Result: PIDLIF模型在正常图像条件下与无物理信息约束的网络性能相当，但在模拟运动模糊导致的图像退化严重情况下，PIDLIF模型仍能保持高性能。

Conclusion: 物理信息方法通过生理分布机制的物理约束，提高了深度学习网络在严重图像退化情况下的鲁棒性，为运动模糊等实际成像问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and
glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic
positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling
requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during
imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the
efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function,
surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF).
In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function
prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images,
incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses
a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of
the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice
accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had
comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when
sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model
maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed
physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by
physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for
out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight
into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to
guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe
degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)的插拔式方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，从而提升大语言模型长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型扩展上下文长度虽然有益但计算成本高昂，主要瓶颈在于自注意力机制的O(N²)复杂度。尽管注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法的效果受限于底层注意力模式，可能导致次优的块级稀疏性。

Method: PBS-Attn方法通过重新排列注意力矩阵来增加块级稀疏性，结合定制的permuted-FlashAttention内核实现高效计算。该方法将序列划分为块，并利用置换特性减少不必要的块间计算。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确度上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现了高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用可行的方法，能够有效提升大语言模型长上下文处理的计算效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.
