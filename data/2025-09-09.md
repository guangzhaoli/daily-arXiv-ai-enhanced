### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种新的标签正则化训练策略，通过为非目标类分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法虽然能提高神经网络的泛化能力，但为所有非目标类分配相同的重要性，破坏了类间关系。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，保持目标类的固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类的标签，考虑类间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能减轻过度自信的预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++在保持标签平滑优势的同时，有效解决了破坏类间关系的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决目标检测中大规模标注数据集获取困难的问题，同时克服传统主动学习缺乏透明度和忽视人类专家战略洞察的局限性

Method: 开发VILOD工具，集成t-SNE图像特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图等可视化组件，支持用户在迭代式人机协作工作流中探索数据和实施多样化的样本选择策略

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同的视觉引导标注策略能够达到与自动化不确定性采样基准相当的竞争性目标检测性能

Conclusion: 该工作为OD标注的人机协作主动学习工作流程提供了新颖工具和实证见解，使其更加透明、可管理且可能更有效

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签损失的平衡因子alpha，以及使用上下文感知模块重新加权教师输出，提升知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定的alpha超参数来平衡硬标签和软标签损失，但静态alpha不是最优的，因为硬监督和软监督之间的最优权衡在训练过程中会变化

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数自动优化；2) 基于师生差异动态计算alpha；3) 引入上下文感知模块(CAM)，使用MLP+Attention自适应重新加权教师输出的类别权重

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师、ResNet-18为学生，相比固定权重KD基线获得更高的准确率，收敛更稳定

Conclusion: 自适应知识蒸馏框架通过动态调整损失平衡和教师输出权重，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能和训练稳定性

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种边中心网络度量方法（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现FRC在计算效率更高的同时能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，特别是评估Forman-Ricci曲率（FRC）是否能达到与Ollivier-Ricci曲率（ORC）相当的剪枝效果

Method: 使用三种网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成随机有线神经网络，应用FRC、ORC和EBC三种边中心度量方法进行剪枝，在COVID-19胸部X射线图像分类任务上评估剪枝效果

Result: FRC剪枝方法在保持与ORC相当性能的同时具有显著的计算效率优势，能够有效简化神经网络结构

Conclusion: FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行神经网络剪枝，在计算效率和性能之间提供了良好的平衡

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和参数高效调优，结合两阶段自校正机制，在多种域偏移场景下显著提升目标识别模型的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，目标识别模型常面临域偏移导致的精度严重下降问题，包括图像统计特征变化、目标姿态视角变化、部分遮挡和类别视觉混淆等挑战

Method: 构建包含"4线索"（精确边界框、类别名、目标级描述、场景级描述）的合成数据集，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优，采用两阶段自校正推理机制

Result: 在隔离单一域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自校正循环的结合，为实现可靠且可迁移的视觉理解提供了一条有前景的路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建大规模中文手写数据库并开发OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，研究发现正字法和语音因素在汉字、部首和笔画三个层级对手写准备和执行具有层次性衰减影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中文手写中语言成分（音韵、语义、正字法系统）在不同层级（字符、部首、笔画）的调节作用，并缺乏细粒度手写数据捕获和批量处理工具

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名中文母语者每人书写1200个汉字），开发升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，使用多元回归分析手写数据

Result: 正字法预测因子在字符、部首和笔画三个层级影响手写准备和执行；语音因素也在所有三个层级影响执行；词汇效应呈现层次性衰减（字符层最强，部首次之，笔画层最弱）

Conclusion: 部首和笔画层级的手写准备和执行与语言成分密切相关，该数据库和工具箱为未来心理语言学和神经语言学研究提供了宝贵资源

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒前的预测以及稳定状态到即将跌倒的瞬态分析尚未探索，需要开发能够提前预警的辅助系统

Method: 使用实时骨骼特征作为输入，DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动，实现早期跌倒检测

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理方法能提升性能，该方法还能监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供有价值的信息

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文进行了脊脑軌瘤MRI分割中硬聚类(K-Means)和软聚类(FCM)的对比分析，发现K-Means计算更快但准确性低，FCM准确性更高但计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊脑軌瘤的准确分割对临床决策和攻击疗法规划至关重要，而軌瘤的异质性和强度分布不均匀使分割面临重大挑战。需要对不同聚类方法进行系统性比较。

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，进行高斯滤波和CLAHE预处理，对比分析K-Means和FCM两种聚类算法。K-Means采用硬分配，FCM采用模糊成员分配。评估指标包括dice相似系数和处理时间。

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3秒/影像，DSC为0.43；FCM平均运行时间1.3秒/影像，DSC为0.67。K-Means速度更快，FCM分割准确性更高。

Conclusion: 硬聚类和软聚类在脊脑軌瘤分割中存在明显的计算效率与边界精度之间的交换。实际应用中需根据具体需求选择适合的算法。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反演文本到图像编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场之间的差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关的偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提高文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)方法，显式建模源与目标速度场差异，引入时间依赖的偏移项将噪声潜在空间推向目标轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，无需架构修改，可高效应用于文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，是高效且广泛适用的编辑框架。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在医学图像分析中难以捕捉对准确诊断至关重要的细粒度和复杂特征，需要增强模型对关键区域的关注能力。

Method: 在VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5五种CNN架构中集成Squeeze and Excitation模块或混合Convolutional Block Attention Module，进行通道和空间特征的自适应重校准。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了在多样化CNN架构中嵌入注意力模块的系统比较框架，为开发鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的深度学习决策支持系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings

Result: 在公开实例分割和物体检测数据集上的实验表明，该框架优于之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无需人工标注的高质量实例分割，为自监督分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Motivation: 在无人机等资源受限环境中部署YOLO架构需要高效的迁移学习，但现有研究缺乏对不同冻结配置在当代YOLO架构中影响的分析。

Method: 使用四个关键基础设施监控数据集，系统研究多种冻结配置，结合梯度行为分析（L2范数）和视觉解释（Grad-CAM）来分析训练动态。

Result: 冻结主干网络可保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。相比全微调，GPU内存减少达28%，部分情况下mAP@50甚至超过全微调。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，特别适用于需要旋转感知感知的应用场景和其他领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Method: 提出RED网络：1）鲁棒导向扰动策略(RPS)对事件随机掩码；2）分离式全注意力机制建模运动内、运动间和跨模态相关性；3）两个交互模块增强模糊图像的运动敏感区域并向事件表示注入语义上下文

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，RED在准确性和鲁棒性方面始终达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件流不完整性带来的挑战，为事件引导的运动去模糊提供了鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Method: 基于WebSSL的大规模单样本高斯头部生成器，采用两阶段训练策略提升泛化能力和高频纹理重建能力，使用超轻量级高斯化身进行控制信号驱动

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90FPS渲染速度，性能随重建模块参数规模增加而提升，定量和定性实验均优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: 分离式框架设计既保证了重建质量，又不影响驱动效率，展现了良好的可扩展性和实用价值

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFFI数据集在模拟真实世界条件方面具有技术先进性和实用价值，能够更好地支持Deepfake检测研究。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VideoGraph方法，将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题，通过递归时空图网络实现关键帧选择，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注帧间的全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的高度相关性。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语言语义。

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间和时间图的节点，通过图边连接表示节点间的语义关系。引入视频衍生的语言查询来增强节点表示的语义知识，避免仅基于视觉相似性配置边。采用递归策略优化初始图并正确分类关键帧。

Result: VideoGraph在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，无论是有监督还是无监督方式，均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要建模为语言引导的时空图问题，通过语义关系建模和递归优化，能够有效提升关键帧选择的准确性和代表性。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)框架，通过自监督学习将预训练的语义知识转移到密集特征空间，在多个密集视觉基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督表示学习方法主要关注全局表示，难以捕捉密集预测任务所需的局部语义和空间精度

Method: 提出PaKA对齐目标，通过匹配教师和学生模型之间密集patch的统计依赖关系来对齐特征分布，并研究专门为密集表示学习设计的数据增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了密集表示学习中的局部语义捕捉问题，证明了通过自监督学习将语义知识转移到密集特征空间的有效性

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在VLA模型上实现显著加速且性能损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限

Method: 包含静态动作级剪枝（利用全局历史和局部上下文）、动态层级剪枝（基于层级重要性）和轻量级动作感知控制器（按动作粒度调整剪枝强度）

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，相比OpenVLA-OFT，在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局信息进行智能token剪枝，SpecPrune-VLA能够有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于鲁棒且有效地擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人等），解决现有方法无法同时兼顾鲁棒性和图像质量的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法大多无法同时实现鲁棒性（彻底移除目标概念）和有效性（保持图像质量），特别是对于狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除存在挑战，需要解决版权和法律问题

Method: SuMa方法首先推导表示待擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化距离的参考子空间来实现中性化处理，确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与目标完备性的方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了狭窄概念擦除的挑战，在保持图像质量的同时实现了鲁棒的概念移除，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析在有限或无标签情况下具有挑战性，需要开发自监督学习方法从航空高光谱图像中提取树木植被特性

Method: 使用自监督学习构建神经网络嵌入空间，该空间反映树木的植被特性，而非直接使用原始高光谱植被特性

Result: 实验结果表明，基于植被特性相关嵌入空间构建的树表示在下游机器学习任务中性能更优

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效创建反映植被特性的嵌入表示，为高光谱图像分析提供更好的特征表示方法

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种YOLO模型在孟加拉国特定车辆数据集上的性能，发现YOLOv11x表现最佳但推理时间较长，中等模型在性能和速度间取得平衡，同时识别了罕见车辆类别检测困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于非孟加拉数据训练的车辆检测系统难以准确识别当地特有车辆类型，这为发展中国家的自动驾驶技术发展造成了关键障碍。

Method: 使用移动手机相机采集高分辨率图像构建包含29种车辆类别的定制数据集，手动标注YOLO格式边界框，评估六种YOLO模型变体的性能。

Result: YOLOv11x获得最佳性能（63.7% mAP@0.5），但推理时间较长（45.8ms/图）；中等模型在性能和速度间平衡；罕见车辆类别如建筑车辆和Desi Nosimons检测准确率接近零。

Conclusion: 研究为开发适应孟加拉国交通条件的鲁棒目标检测系统奠定了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中国家表现不足的关键需求。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征集成模块和感知器注意力分解，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑并保持身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失与扩散模型联合动态训练、以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在最小数据润滑条件下讨论可编辑性注入问题。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中实现了深度多层级语义编辑并保持身份一致性，满足了长提示和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的技术方法在少量数据条件下实现了高质量的语义编辑和身份保持。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用LLM预测对象出现和消失，然后生成详细的人-物关系。将场景图预测解耦为LSGA任务

Result: 在短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 语言模型能够有效整合常识知识进行场景图预测，提出的OOTSM方法在长短期预测中均表现优异

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

TL;DR: 该论文将高能物理中的pileup抑制原理转化为图像去噪的归纳偏置，提出基于物理启发的去噪网络，在高噪声条件下展现出比纯数据驱动模型更好的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 受高能粒子物理中pileup噪声处理的启发，研究如何将物理原理（如守恒性、局部性和隔离性）作为归纳偏置嵌入神经网络架构，提升图像去噪在强噪声条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出层次化的PU-inspired去噪器：包括带守恒约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变体，以及将物理原理集成到UNet骨干网络中的WIPUNet模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上的实验表明，PU-inspired CNN与标准基线相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平下显示出扩大的性能优势，证明物理启发的先验能在纯数据驱动模型性能下降时提供稳定性。

Conclusion: 物理启发的归纳偏置能够有效提升图像去噪模型在高噪声条件下的鲁棒性，这种模块化的方法不需要依赖复杂的SOTA架构即可实现性能增益。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等数据集上 consistently达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CAMVR通过创新的记忆管理和注意力引导机制，有效解决了多轮视觉语言推理中的关键挑战

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 解决图像分割预测评估中的重现性危机，特别是距离基准指标实现不精确导致的评估差异问题。当前开源工具在Hausdorff距离和标准化表面距离等指标上存在显著差异。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用网格基础方法进行距离基准指标的计算，比传统的格点基础方法更加精确。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证显示，MeshMetrics在准确性和精度方面都超过现有工具，并且受到离散化效应（如距离量化）的影响更小。

Conclusion: 论文成功开发了一个更精确的图像分割评估工具MeshMetrics，并以开源Python包形式发布，有助于提高预测评估的可靠性和可重现性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法对复杂视角变化的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过联合感知RGB和法线图像，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能，达到了最先进水平

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中时间不一致性问题，提升下游SLAM系统的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：(i)时间嵌入相似性对齐连续潜在空间，(ii)运动对齐变换损失匹配位移，(iii)窗口时间融合模块；同时更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出更好的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: 提出的LiDAR-BIND-T框架保持了即插即用的模态融合特性，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，KITTI户外场景2倍和4倍超分辨率分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM，分别超越现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB

Conclusion: 建立了首个理论基础的深度自适应超分辨率框架，在深度变化场景中显著提升性能，同时在传统基准上保持竞争力

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有工作大多只关注单人或仅考虑对话手势，假设演员的身体朝向和位置基本不变。本文旨在同时建模两人的活动，针对目标驱动、动态且语义一致的长时间大空间交互。

Method: 采集了241个多模态交互序列的InterAct数据集，提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，并设计了新颖的微调机制来提高嘴唇动作准确性。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集填补了长期动态交互行为数据的空白，提出的扩散方法为多人交互行为生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层解析和推理方法有效解决了参考视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐挑战，提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Conclusion: PictOBI-20k数据集可以促进未来甲骨文导向LMMs中视觉注意力的评估和优化，为甲骨文解码研究提供重要支持

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Motivation: 在医学成像中，点分布模型常用于基于完整形状统计模型重建和补全部分形状。但常被忽视的关键因素是训练数据相对于目标部分形状的姿态对齐问题，这种姿态差异会导致重建结果出现偏差，特别是在观察形状的小部分时。

Conclusion: 姿态对齐对部分形状重建至关重要，所提出的方法能够有效解决姿态不一致问题，提升重建性能，具有广泛的实用价值。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Motivation: PointPillars虽然是最快的3D目标检测器，但由于伪图像表示无法保留精确的3D结构，且难以采用两阶段检测流程，导致性能不及最先进方法。

Method: 1) 提出3DPillars CNN架构，通过可分离体素特征模块从伪图像表示中学习3D体素特征；2) 引入带有稀疏场景上下文特征模块的RoI头，聚合多尺度特征来优化3D目标提议。

Conclusion: 该方法成功克服了PointPillars的局限性，实现了首个基于伪图像表示的高效两阶段3D检测框架，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: CRAB通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，为BEV视角下的3D目标检测提供了更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

TL;DR: 提出基于MODIS卫星多波段图像的近实时沙尘检测系统，使用3D卷积网络学习36个波段的空间光谱模式，准确率达到0.92，可提供全球尺度的及时沙尘预警。

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统评估多个先进深度学习分割模型在有限的心血管疾病组织学图像数据集上发现，模型性能在低数据情况下极其敏感于数据分割方式，表明标准性能排名可能不能真实反映临床效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病组织学图像的精确分割对心血管疾病研究至关重要，但缺乏注释数据限制了深度学习模型的发展，需要评估现有模型在这种低数据场景下的真实性能。

Method: 采用贝叶斯搜索策略进行深度调优，在有限的心血管疾病组织学图像数据集上评估U-Net、DeepLabV3+、SegFormer以及SAM、MedSAM、MedSAM+UNet等多个先进分割模型。

Result: 模型性能显示出对数据分割的高度敏感性，不同模型之间的差异更多来自统计噪声而非真正的算法优势，性能排名在不同数据分割下出现显著波动。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理图像对，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解中视觉-语义对齐的效果。

Method: 设计了变化提取模块来捕捉时间特征和空间语义变化，并引入提示增强机制，将上下文线索融入提示中以增强模型对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat有效解决了双时相图像变化分析中的关键挑战，支持双时相变化描述并保留了单图像解释能力。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中无法可靠评估肌肉骨骼风险，需要开发多模态方法进行早期风险预防

Method: ViSK-GAT框架结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块，包含细粒度注意力模块(FGAM)和多模态几何对应模块(MGCM)，使用视觉和骨骼坐标多模态数据进行训练

Result: 验证和测试准确率分别达到93.55%和93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，各项指标均显著优于9种流行的迁移学习骨干网络

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推进了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学提供重要工具

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，将特征嵌入压缩到极低比特率（每像素0.002-0.003比特），保持跨任务语义完整性，比特率不到主流方法的5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保持而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，传统深度学习方法无法满足这些需求

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本和表征能力，提出基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，压缩CLIP特征嵌入而非原始图像

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3×10⁻³ bpp，比主流方法节省95%以上比特率，在极端压缩下仍具有跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法实现了极低比特率下的语义保持，为新兴应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键限制：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽略细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 设计了属性检索模块聚类视觉特征，从提示池中检索语义相似的提示并连接到文本编码器的每一层输入。采用双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，并引入自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过分层视觉信息和动态提示实现了更好的语义表示和泛化能力。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Motivation: 现有的基于SDE的随机采样方法会在Flow Matching框架中引入明显的噪声伪影，这对奖励学习过程有害，需要找到更好的采样策略

Method: 受DDIM启发，重新构建采样过程，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，消除噪声伪影，实现更准确的奖励建模

Result: CPS方法有效消除了噪声伪影，使得基于强化学习的优化器（如Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO）能够实现更快更稳定的收敛

Conclusion: CPS采样方法成功解决了SDE采样的噪声问题，为强化学习在Flow Matching模型中的应用提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上进行实验，方法在数量和质量上都显示出优勃性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，提升医学图像分割的准确性，尤其在边界区域显示出更好的性能

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Motivation: 解决当前医学视觉任务中自监督方法大多借鉴2D视觉设计，缺乏对3D空间知识学习过程的直观展示，导致医学可解释性不足的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学3D成像中成功实现了性能与可解释性的平衡，为自监督学习在医疗领域的应用提供了更直观的解决方案。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Motivation: 艺术风格转换领域缺乏真实监督数据是一个根本性挑战，传统方法受限于没有真实配对数据的问题。

Method: 提出去风格化(destylization)方法，通过文本引导的去风格化模型DST重建无风格内容，并使用多阶段评估模型DST-Filter自动筛选高质量数据对，构建DST-100K大规模数据集。

Result: 基于FLUX.1-dev的简单前馈模型OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，解决了艺术风格转换中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战。

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法，将所有样本映射到统一的领域来捕获领域不变特征并桥接领域差距，训练时优化映射以适应已见领域，测试时对未见领域样本进行类似投影

Result: 在多种场景下持续优于现有方法，当只有有限已见领域时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: 通过统一的领域映射方法有效减少领域偏移影响，即使在领域差距大或已见领域少的情况下也能显著提升领域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: STRIDE模型通过创新的引导策略和架构设计，成功实现了高质量的稀疏视图CT图像重建，在多个评价指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real

*Diana-Alexandra Sas,Florin Oniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦策略，通过注入预计算的语义分割信息先验来增强单目3D目标检测性能，特别在小目标（行人、骑行者）检测上超越仅使用RGB特征的架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入是单张2D图像，缺乏深度信息，是一个病态问题。现有方法主要依赖CNN或Transformer提取特征，但缺乏对输入数据的深度理解。

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的语义分割信息先验直接融合到特征空间中指导检测，不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，避免增加额外的预测分支。

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准测试中，该方法在行人、骑行者等小目标检测上超越了仅使用RGB特征的等效架构。

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，语义分割信息的注入能有效提升单目3D检测性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将人体姿态估计的深度学习框架应用于航天器6-DoF姿态估计，结合运动感知热图和光流来捕捉时序信息，在SPADES-RGB和SPARK-2024数据集上表现优于单图像基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像姿态估计方法无法利用空间操作中固有的宝贵时序信息，需要开发能够整合运动动态的方法

Method: 使用Vision Transformer编码器提取图像特征，结合预训练光流模型获取运动线索来定位2D关键点，然后通过PnP求解器从已知2D-3D对应关系恢复6-DoF姿态

Result: 在2D关键点定位和6-DoF姿态估计方面均优于单图像基线方法，并在不同数据分布上展现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 整合时序信息和运动动态的深度学习方法能够显著提升航天器姿态估计性能，具有很好的实际应用前景

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理视觉问答中的模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，但盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片模糊且问题表述模糊，导致多个有效答案，需要系统能够处理这种不确定性

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，用PolyFormer进行空间定位，再通过思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中超越先前方法，对辅助环境中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，该框架为此提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Motivation: 现有开放词汇检测的大规模预训练数据集主要是地面自然图像，与无人机图像存在显著领域差距，导致在无人机图像上性能大幅下降

Method: 提出改进的无人机标注引擎，构建UAVDE-2M(200万实例/1800类别)和UAVCAP-15k(1.5万图像)数据集，设计跨注意力门控增强融合(CAGE)模块并集成到YOLO-World-v2架构

Result: 在VisDrone和SIMD数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法在无人机图像和遥感应用中的有效性

Conclusion: 通过构建专用数据集和设计CAGE融合模块，有效解决了无人机开放词汇检测中的领域适应问题，提升了检测性能

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的细粒度动态感知框架FDP，用于面部微表情识别，通过排序帧级特征编码动态信息，结合局部-全局特征感知Transformer和动态图像构建任务，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部微表情识别中由于微表情的短暂性、细微性和动态性带来的挑战，现有方法要么需要手工特征和关键帧，要么受限于小规模和低多样性训练数据。

Method: 提出FDP框架：1）按时间顺序对原始帧序列的帧级特征进行排序以编码动态信息；2）使用局部-全局特征感知Transformer进行帧表示学习；3）采用排序器计算每个帧级特征的排序分数；4）通过时间维度池化捕获动态表示；5）同时进行微表情分类和动态图像构建任务。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上，F1分数分别比之前最佳结果提高了4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%，显著优于最先进的微表情识别方法。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕获与微表情相关的面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了卓越性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D通过创新的稀疏时空融合方法有效解决了传统视觉-LiDAR里程计的局限性，实现了高精度、强鲁棒性和高效率的位姿估计，具备实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and

100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from

Conclusion: 整合细节保留下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为无人机电力线路小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical

applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Motivation: 病理图像分析对自动化肿瘤诊断至关重要，但由于组织结构相似性和形态学细微变化而具有挑战性。现有视觉语言模型难以捕捉结构化病理报告解释所需的复杂推理。

Method: 提出PathoHR-Bench基准测试，并开发病理学特定的视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验评估表明该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在细粒度病理表示方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型难以有效建模复杂的跨模态关系，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。提出的方法通过专门的训练方案显著提升了病理图像分析的性能。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARDIE是一种无监督图像聚类算法，基于颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，能生成对图像增强更有意义的聚类结果，并可用于图像增强数据集的重采样，提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动图像聚类在图像增强应用中受限的问题，因为传统基于语义属性的聚类方法难以产生对图像增强有意义的聚类结果。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，并引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适合图像增强任务，利用这些聚类重采样图像增强数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强提供了一种有效的无监督聚类方法，公开代码以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，使用Transformer架构从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，在保持空间细节和光谱保真度方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱图像（高空间分辨率但光谱分辨率有限）和高光谱图像（丰富光谱但空间分辨率低）之间的基本权衡问题，现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度

Method: 基于3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，设计优化的波段序列重复和排序五个多光谱输入波段以更好地捕捉pairwise关系，从5个多光谱波段重建224个高光谱波段

Result: PSNR达到35.82 dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，相比基线MHF-Net在PSNR上提升+5.6 dB，ERGAS降低超过一半

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D在光谱重建质量上显著优于现有方法，并在土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割等下游任务中展示了实用价值

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了RetinaGuard框架，通过生成对抗掩蔽机制保护视网膜图像中的生物特征隐私，同时保持图像质量和疾病诊断价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私泄露风险，需要保护敏感生物信息同时维持医疗实用性

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化年龄编码器实现通用防御

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小，且可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私保护问题，为医疗AI应用的隐私安全提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Motivation: 为了解决现有音视频生成模型中存在的训练效率低、音视频对齐不准确以及文本标注导致的性能下降问题，开发一个能够同时生成高质量协调音频和视频的统一模型。

Method: 采用专家缝合(SoE)技术融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型，避免从头训练；开发在线标注管道处理训练数据并生成标注，确保音视频内容的准确对齐；在7600小时音视频数据上进行微调。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家缝合和在线标注技术，成功实现了高效的多模态音视频生成，为研究社区提供了有价值的开源资源，推动了音视频生成领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

TL;DR: UNO是一个统一的单阶段框架，通过扩展的slot attention机制同时处理粗粒度和细粒度的视频场景图生成任务，无需任务特定架构或多阶段训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法要么针对粗粒度的框级检测，要么针对细粒度的全景像素级检测，需要不同的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 使用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，引入对象时间一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致，动态三元组预测模块捕捉随时间演化的交互关系。

Result: 在标准框级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中取得竞争性性能，并通过统一的对象中心设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO框架成功实现了视频场景图生成任务的统一处理，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，展示了对象中心设计在跨粒度视觉任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Motivation: 解决全球骨折诊断挑战，特别是在医疗资源有限地区，传统影像方法成本高、有辐射且需要专业解读

Method: 使用定制卷积神经网络(CNN)并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2、ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比，在包含4083张X光片的FracAtlas数据集上进行训练

Result: 定制CNN达到95.96%准确率、0.94精确率、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数，迁移学习模型在此特定设置下表现较差

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在X射线骨折检测中具有潜力，强调公平基准测试、多样化数据集和外部验证对临床转化的重要性

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）依赖自我中心多视角观测，需要更好的空间推理能力评估方法。

Method: 创建包含8,600+QA对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过基于估计全局3D坐标生成认知地图来增强3D空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示当前SOTA VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题QA上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需大幅改进空间推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for

Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的量化指标（SH和TEWL）对公众监测皮肤状况、诊断皮肤问题和个性化护肤方案很有价值，但目前需要专业仪器测量，不便普及。

Method: 开发多阶段系统方案：收集SH/TEWL数据、数据预处理、构建新型Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer回归模型，并提出对称对比正则化方法解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 首次实现无需物理测量的自拍面部图像皮肤评估，有效减少因数据不平衡导致的模型偏差。

Conclusion: 该研究架起了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的桥梁，为更广泛的实际应用实现了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景中定位性能良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新物体类别）中存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: PAML框架包含：使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐、视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示、原型发现和继承机制提取多邻居语义原型、多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景中表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到最先进水平

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性地解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，有效提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅依靠视觉内容往往不足以可靠地发现新类别。为了解决这个问题，作者将GCD扩展到视频领域，旨在利用多视角时间信息来提高新类别发现的准确性。

Method: 提出了MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习（CACL）利用多视角时间特征估计未标记实例间的一致性分数来加权对比损失；记忆引导表示增强（MGRE）通过双级内存缓冲区维护特征级和logit级表示，提供全局上下文以增强类内紧凑性和类间可分离性。

Result: 在构建的新Video-GCD基准测试（包括动作识别和鸟类分类视频数据集）上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法显著优于从图像设置改编的竞争性GCD方法，突显了时间信息对于视频中新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 时间信息对于视频中的新类别发现至关重要，MCCL框架通过整合时空线索和建立表示学习与一致性建模之间的相互增强反馈循环，有效解决了Video-GCD挑战。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有货币识别系统忽视可用性和真伪评估，特别是在视觉障碍用户和离线验证的低资源环境中，现有方法主要关注面额分类而忽略物理损坏和伪造问题

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新型统一货币损坏指数（UCDI）量化损坏程度，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测，数据集包含82,000+标注图像

Conclusion: 该框架证明准确、可解释且紧凑的解决方案能够在实际环境中支持包容性货币评估，解决受限环境中的关键部署挑战

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧中的基础对象信息中受益，但传统的文本对象描述方法会引入额外标记长度和对对象级信息噪声的敏感性。

Method: 提出GO-Tokenizer轻量级附加模块，利用现成的对象检测器实时编码紧凑的对象信息，避免使用文本描述。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用GO-Tokenizer进行预训练的性能优于原始视频大语言模型及其使用文本对象描述的对应方法，在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务上具有泛化性。

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer通过紧凑的对象信息编码有效提升了视频大语言模型的时间敏感视频理解能力，是解决文本描述局限性的有效方案。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的人脸反欺诈方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVS模块提取局部细节和全局上下文特征，MTPA模块将补丁与多个文本表示对齐，均使用多组释义文本来增强泛化性。

Result: 在跨域数据集上取得了优于现有最先进方法的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多视角和多文本策略有效提升了人脸反欺诈的跨域检测能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个统一的深度学习诊断管道，能够简化结直肠疾病的检测过程，提高诊断的一致性和效率。

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Conclusion: 该方法为精准农业中的干旱压力监测提供了一种实用、可扩展且适应性强的解决方案，特别适用于资源约束条件下的实时应用。

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在大型场景重建中，输入视角通常来自空间有限区域，虽然场景本身可能无限大，但重建主要对相同区域的新视角有效。需要考虑坐标量化问题，研究位置误差对像素投影误差的影响。

Method: 分析了投影误差与投影点距离的关系，发现投影误差与投影点距离平方的倒数成正比。基于此提出了基于球坐标的新型量化方案。

Conclusion: 针对3DoF+场景（相机位置自由度受限的情况），提出的球坐标量化方案能够有效处理位置量化误差，提升3D高斯泼溅在有限视角区域重建大场景的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Motivation: 解决现有视频伪装目标检测方法的两大问题：SAM方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘，MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景背景而导致目标分离性差。

Method: 结合SAM和MLLM，通过时空线索表示视频序列，利用LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；通过动态前景视觉标记评分模块和提示网络生成多线索自适应指导SAM；采用解耦前景-背景学习策略分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight方法有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的关键挑战，在准确性和泛化性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

<details>

Motivation: 当前缺乏有效的全参考图像质量评估方法来比较和评估不同的超分辨率算法，需要一种更符合人类视觉系统的评估方法

Method: 采用三模块结构：图像编码器、感知导向双向注意力模块（包含双向注意力、分组多尺度可变形卷积和子信息激励卷积）、质量预测模块

Result: 在广泛实验中证明PBAN超越了最先进的质量评估方法

Conclusion: PBAN通过创新的双向注意力机制和自适应失真感知设计，为超分辨率图像质量评估提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中性能下降，而现有增强方法需要额外训练、依赖外部分割工具或仅在粗粒度操作，忽略了模型内在的注意力能力

Method: 分析VLMs注意力模式，发现视觉复杂度与注意力熵强相关；提出CARVE方法，通过对比通用查询和任务特定查询的注意力图来分解视觉信号为语义信号和视觉噪声

Result: CARVE方法能持续提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，通过对比注意力为改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: 研究前沿视觉基础模型在医疗等专业领域的迁移效果，探索DINOv3作为统一编码器在医疗视觉任务中的直接应用潜力。

Method: 在广泛的医疗成像模态上对DINOv3进行基准测试，包括2D/3D分类和分割任务，系统分析模型大小和输入图像分辨率对性能的影响。

Result: DINOv3展现出令人印象深刻的性能，建立了强大的新基线，在多个任务上甚至优于医疗专用模型，但在WSI、EM和PET等需要深度专业化的场景中特征会退化。

Conclusion: DINOv3可作为医疗视觉任务的强大基线模型，其视觉特征可作为多种复杂医疗任务的稳健先验，为未来研究开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出FSG-Net网络，通过频域和空间域协同处理，解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化和语义鸿沟问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像变化检测面临两个关键挑战：一是模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化，导致误报；二是深层抽象特征与浅层细节丰富特征之间存在语义鸿沟，阻碍有效融合，导致边界模糊

Method: 提出频率-空间协同门控网络（FSG-Net），包含三个核心模块：1）差异感知小波交互模块（DAWIM）在频域自适应处理不同频率分量，抑制伪变化；2）协同时空注意力模块（STSAM）在空间域增强真实变化区域的显著性；3）轻量级门控融合单元（LGFU）利用高层语义选择性门控和整合浅层关键细节

Result: 在CDD、GZ-CD和LEVIR-CD三个基准数据集上分别达到94.16%、89.51%和91.27%的F1分数，建立了新的最先进性能

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化和特征融合问题，显著提升了检测精度和边界质量

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Motivation: 工业质量控制中人工识别和移除不想要的物品效率低下且成本高，传统全监督方法需要大量标注工作，而利用操作员移除动作自然提供的隐式监督的弱监督方法尚未充分探索。

Method: 定义Before-After Supervision概念，利用操作员移除物品前后的图像差异作为监督信号，训练分割网络；构建包含11,000+高分辨率视频帧的多视角WS^2数据集；开发端到端管道对现有弱监督分割方法进行基准测试。

Conclusion: Before-After Supervision是一种有效的弱监督分割方法，能够利用操作员的自然动作提供监督信号，减少对人工标注的依赖，在工业质量控制领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Motivation: 现有的主题驱动图像生成方法在处理保持主体身份和遵循动态编辑指令之间的平衡方面存在不足，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出TIDE框架，采用目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像、指令、目标图像)三元组建模主体适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型，使用系统生成的平衡样本和失真样本进行偏好学习。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出色，在保持主体忠实性和指令遵循性方面优于基线方法，在多个定量指标上都有优异表现。

Conclusion: TIDE框架有效解决了主题驱动图像生成中的关键挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多种任务上的通用性。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 将学习到的图像表示与领域特定的放射组学特征相结合，为神经肿瘤学中的自动化治疗反应评估提供了强大有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: 本研究未能复现FairCLIP在提升CLIP模型公平性和性能方面的效果，发现原始模型描述与实现存在差异，并提出了改进版本A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+，但实验结果显示正则化目标虽然减少了Sinkhorn距离，但并未改善零样本青光眼分类的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，该方法的目的是通过最小化敏感群体间的图像-文本相似性分数差异来改善CLIP模型的群体公平性。

Method: 复现Luo等人的实验设置，发现模型描述与原始实现存在差异后提出了A-FairCLIP实现来检验具体设计选择，并提出了支持多属性的FairCLIP+扩展，同时探索了距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响。

Result: 在哈佛-FairVLMed数据集上的实验表明，虽然正则化目标减少了Sinkhorn距离，但官方实现和A-FairCLIP均未能在零样本青光眼分类中提升性能或公平性，结果不支持原始论文关于FairCLIP改善CLIP性能和公平性的主张。

Conclusion: FairCLIP方法在实验验证中未能实现其宣称的公平性和性能改进效果，尽管CLIP模型确实存在对特定人口统计群体的偏见，但所提出的公平性正则化方法并未有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对场景级草图检索的训练方法，通过预训练、编码器架构和损失函数的适当组合，在不增加额外复杂性的情况下实现了最先进的性能，强调了对草图变异性的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到真实世界草图中存在的固有模糊性和噪声，传统方法主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽略了草图本身的变异性问题。

Method: 采用预训练、特定编码器架构和专门设计的损失函数组合，训练目标明确设计为对草图变异性具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行了广泛实验，证实了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，同时指出需要改进场景级草图检索的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法应对连续数据流中不断出现新未知类别的增量学习场景，导致决策边界判别性难以维持

Method: 提出保持性角度表示学习(RARL)，在等角紧框架构建的角度空间中让未知表示对齐非活跃原型；采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略压缩已知表示；设计分层修正策略优化决策边界

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上建立新基准，在各种任务设置下实现最先进性能

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和类间混淆问题，为动态开放环境下的持续学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为向量值图像的数学形态学处理提供了一种有效的排序方案，通过机器学习近似Condorcet排序解决了向量排序选择的难题

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Motivation: 现有多视角扩散模型多为非自回归形式，限制了视角数量灵活性且推理速度慢，无法满足世界建模的需求。

Method: 采用自回归设置，使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，结合成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制，推理时使用空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强技术。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型在灵活性和效率方面的挑战，为3D新视角合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Motivation: 野生动物不可持续贸易对生物多样性构成严重威胁，现在还演变到数字化市场和社交媒体。面对巨量的数字内容，需要自动化方法来检测野生动物贸易列表，尤其是象牙等野生动物制品的识别

Method: 开发机器学习对象识别模型，使用来自非法销售或被收约的象、乳犀龟和虎制品图片进行训练。研究了各种训练策略和两种损失函数的组合，分别为每个物种训练模型以及开发一个能识别三种物种制品的单一模型

Result: 最佳模型的整体准确率为84.2%，具体识别象、乳犀龟和虎制品的准确率分别为71.1%、90.2%和93.5%。手机应用程序的整体准确率达到91.3%，可以实时拍照并帮助识别潜在的禁止物品

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于网络贸易监测，还可以在实体市场中监测野生动物贸易，为政府部门和执法机构提供了可行的监测工具

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

TL;DR: 提出HSANet网络用于LDCT/PET图像降噪，结合高效全局注意力模块和混合上采样模块，在保持轻量级模型的同时实现优异降噪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然降低了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，需要有效的降噪方法

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止噪声过拟合

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet相比现有方法具有更优的降噪性能，且模型轻量适合标准GPU部署

Conclusion: HSANet方法具有很高的实际临床应用价值，能够在保持辐射安全的同时提升图像质量

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出新颖的CNN-LSTM深度学习框架，使用多模态图像数据在复合胁迫环境下准确分类氮胁迫严重程度，达到98%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物在自然环境中面临多种相互作用的胁迫，氮素缺乏与干旱和杂草竞争复合时效应难以区分，早期检测对植物健康保护和管理策略制定至关重要

Method: 使用RGB、多光谱和两种红外波长的四模态成像，构建CNN提取空间特征与LSTM捕捉时间依赖性的时空深度学习管道，并与仅空间CNN模型进行对比

Result: CNN-LSTM管道达到98%的准确率，显著优于仅空间模型的80.45%和之前机器学习方法的76%

Conclusion: 该平台能有效捕捉氮缺乏、水分胁迫和杂草压力间的复杂相互作用，为及时主动识别氮胁迫严重程度提供了有前景的工具

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Method: 评估六种最先进的自监督学习框架，包括CNN和ViT模型，使用基于位置的正则化方法，在不同维度的潜在空间中进行比较分析。

Result: 位置正则化相比标准自监督学习持续提升下游分类性能，CNN平均F1分数提升4.9±4.0%，ViT提升6.3±8.9%；低维表示下CNN性能提升更显著。

Conclusion: 位置元数据对自监督学习正则化具有重要价值，特别是在使用低维潜在表示时；高维ViT模型在海床图像分析中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，用于无监督实时分析海底图像，能够在连续数据流中自适应处理，无需完整数据集或人工标注，在计算效率和聚类准确性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长续航海底AUV的发展，需要实时解释海底图像来实现自适应任务和优化通信效率，但现有离线方法依赖完整数据集和人工标注，无法满足实时需求。

Method: 设计在线聚类框架(OCF)，通过识别和维护代表性样本来捕捉演化特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割，无需重新处理完整图像历史，在恒定时间内高效处理连续数据流。

Result: 在三个不同海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有在线聚类方法中获得最高平均F1分数0.68，标准差3%，计算时间随数据量增加保持稳定且有限。

Conclusion: OCF框架具有优异的聚类能力和对轨迹变化的鲁棒性，适用于生成调查数据摘要和支持长期自主海洋探索中的信息路径规划。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Motivation: 传统高斯溅射需要RGB-D/立体相机提供精确深度，但深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度信息导致合成效果差，而现有单目深度估计模型存在跨帧不一致、远距离不准确和纹理歧义等问题

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有卓越的渲染质量

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，为高质量高斯溅射渲染提供了有效的深度生成方案

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节且与背景对齐不精确；难以生成像素级的细粒度异常。这些问题限制了异常分割模型的性能提升。

Method: STAGE采用分级扩散框架，包含三个核心创新：(1)引入干净背景信息作为先验来指导去噪分布；(2)使用异常分支在前向和反向过程中显式记录局部异常；(3)采用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的分级扩散框架和显式掩码对齐策略，成功解决了工业异常合成中的纹理细节缺失和背景对齐问题，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的测试时LoRA适配器和引导场修正，实现了高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖计算昂贵的微调，要么在潜在空间中进行轨迹控制时忽略3D透视，导致不真实的运动和潜在操作与网络噪声预测之间的不对齐。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导测试时LoRA适配器（通过区域特征一致性损失实现共适应）、以及引导场修正（通过一步前瞻策略优化条件引导场）。

Result: Zo3T显著提升了轨迹控制图像到视频生成的3D真实感和运动准确性，在性能上超越了现有的基于训练和零样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过测试时训练机制有效解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动约束问题，为高质量的零样本图像到视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: 提出的协同分割框架能够有效利用组织与细胞核分割任务之间的内在联系，相互增强，显著提升组织病理学图像分析性能

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但高成本、有限分辨率和缺乏自动对焦等功能限制了其广泛应用，特别是在早期开发和原型设计阶段。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的模拟框架，支持在嵌入式平台上部署，并设计了同步记录原始数据、RGB和事件流的数据采集管道。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，促进了基于事件的视觉研究和早期系统开发，代码已在线公开。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the

feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly

our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in

categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a

Conclusion: UMO通过统一的优化框架有效解决了多身份图像定制中的关键挑战，为现有方法提供了通用的身份保持增强方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差和特征学习效率低的问题

Method: 使用对比学习（包括实例判别、上下文对比学习和多视角对比学习），采用LRCN（CNN+LSTM）主干网络结合Bahdanau注意力机制，测试多种对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级等细粒度边界

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构在视频年龄分级任务中表现优异，通过对比学习提升了判别能力和适应性，已部署为实用的实时分类解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

TL;DR: Curia是一个在13万TB真实世界放射影像数据上训练的基础模型，在19项任务上表现优异，能够准确识别器官、检测疾病并预测肿瘤分期结果，性能达到或超过放射科医生水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射诊断主要依赖单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新策划的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Result: Curia在器官识别、脑出血和心肌梗死等疾病检测、肿瘤分期预测等任务上表现优异，性能达到或超过放射科医生和最新基础模型，在跨模态和低数据场景下展现出临床显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: Curia展示了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为推进该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过迁移学习适应通用基础模型和整合手术室多模态数据来支持外科数据科学的方法，在手术视频分析任务中显示领域适应和多模态集成能提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用通用基础模型通过迁移学习和整合手术室多模态数据来支持外科数据科学应用，提高手术视频分析任务的性能

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，通过无标签手术视频数据进行微调，并整合手术室的时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型，在肝脏手术视频数据集上进行住院时间和术后并发症预测，在HeiCo数据集上进行手术阶段识别

Result: 领域特定数据的微调显著提高模型性能，多模态数据整合在内部数据集上同样带来性能提升，在HeiCo数据集上单模态基线性能已与EndoVis2017挑战赛最佳结果相当，微调后精度进一步提升

Conclusion: 外科数据科学可以充分利用公共通用基础模型，领域适应和合适的多模态数据整合具有巨大潜力，研究发布了代码和模型权重以支持进一步研究

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在拓扑伪影情况下失效的问题，针对多视图重建等实际场景中常见的拓扑缺陷

Method: 使用拓扑自适应变形模型，在ARAP和双射关联约束下联合优化模板网格拓扑结构及其与目标形状的对齐

Result: 在包含噪声的多视图重建等拓扑伪影场景中，即使不依赖大数据集训练，也能在3D对齐质量上超越数据驱动方法

Conclusion: 该方法为处理拓扑变化的非刚性3D网格匹配提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于现实世界中存在拓扑缺陷的场景

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Result: 在二元分割基准测试中达到竞争性精度，参数量显著减少，推理速度更快，适合实时和资源有限的临床环境部署

Conclusion: 该方法提供了实时医学图像分割的实用替代方案，平衡了精度和效率，适用于临床实际应用

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲了流形结构并减慢了收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂的流形结构。

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，将其投影到球形空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中用Riemannian距离近似geodesic距离，并使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化加速收敛。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验显示，在患者特定和非特定场景下均获得了优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更具表达力和几何一致性的深度相似度度量，增强了区分细微姿态差异的能力。

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业视觉监测中泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field

Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型在图像生成能力上有显著改进，但在指令跟随和细节保持方面仍落后于GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统

Method: 提出Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行文本推理和图像合成：先产生文本思考指导初始图像生成，然后反思结果以细化细节、视觉质量和美学，同时保持语义

Conclusion: IRG框架通过交织推理有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，证明了推理-生成交替策略的有效性

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor
diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high
accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and
accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major
source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we
classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We
also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer
learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model
performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The
Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5%
Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN,
UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices
such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect
real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for
timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset
validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned
EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96%
specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore
the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个基于语言提示生成高分辨率3D医学反事实图像的方法，填补了3D医学影像生成领域的空白，特别针对神经影像数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在2D图像生成方面表现出色，但缺乏3D预训练基础模型限制了3D医学图像生成的发展。需要开发能够根据自然语言描述生成高质量3D医学反事实图像的方法，以支持临床诊断、疾病进展模拟和医学培训等应用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为3D医学影像中的提示驱动疾病进展分析奠定了基础，展示了语言引导3D医学图像生成的可行性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

TL;DR: 提出FASL-Seg模型，通过双流特征处理机制实现手术场景的精确语义分割，在多个数据集上超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术语义分割研究主要关注手术工具而忽略解剖结构，且当前SOTA模型难以平衡高层上下文特征和低层边缘特征的捕获。

Method: 设计特征自适应空间定位模型(FASL-Seg)，包含低层特征投影流(LLFP)和高层特征投影流(HLFP)，分别处理不同分辨率特征。

Result: 在EndoVis18数据集上达到72.71%的mIoU，比SOTA提升5%；在工具类型分割任务上分别达到85.61%和72.78%的mIoU，整体性能优于SOTA。

Conclusion: 双流处理机制能有效处理不同分辨率特征，在解剖结构和手术器械分割方面均表现出色，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型主要针对单模态图像设计，在医学影像中面临多模态数据处理、模态缺失和标注数据有限等临床挑战，需要开发能够有效处理这些问题的解决方案。

Method: 提出MM-DINOv2框架，包含多模态补丁嵌入处理多模态数据，采用全模态掩码技术处理缺失模态问题，并利用半监督学习充分利用未标注数据集。

Result: 在多序列脑MRI胶质瘤亚型分类任务中，在外部测试集上达到0.6的MCC分数，比当前最优监督方法提升11.1%。

Conclusion: 该工作为多模态医学影像任务建立了一个可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效利用自然图像预训练的视觉基础模型，同时解决临床实践中数据缺失和标注有限的实际问题。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited
annotations.

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable
alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully
classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as

Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced
reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a
small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability
to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for
single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and
limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing
acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and
their accurate and robust detection and classification.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于激光定向能量沉积(DED)的构建高度同步条纹投影系统，实现了±46μm的表面重建精度，并开发了基于几何的点云指标来自动识别沉积缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定向能量沉积(DED)工艺容易产生几何偏差、未熔合和表面粗糙等缺陷，需要开发原位监测方法来提高工艺可靠性。

Method: 采用构建高度同步的条纹投影系统进行层间表面3D重建，并引入局部点密度和法向变化率两个几何指标来自动识别表面缺陷。

Result: 实现了±46μm的高精度表面重建，能够自动识别未熔合缺陷和表面粗糙问题，无需人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法将几何偏差与缺陷形成直接关联，实现了精确的异常定位，为DED工艺的闭环控制提供了可行方案，推动了可认证增材制造的发展。

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种可解释的水印系统，用于追踪合成媒体的生成链和变换过程，通过分析水印的变化来推断媒体经历的各种变换操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成媒体的兴起和AI技术的发展，数字图像的真实性受到严重挑战。多种编辑应用使取证分析变得复杂，需要开发新方法来重建媒体生成的事件链，揭示潜在的犯罪意图。

Method: 开发了tell-tale水印系统，针对不同类型的变换（语义编辑、光度调整、几何投影）定制水印。这些水印与载体媒体同步变换，留下可解释的痕迹，然后通过解释性推理在组合参数空间中推断最合理的变换历史。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的可解释水印系统为合成媒体的取证分析提供了新方法，能够有效重建媒体生成的事件链，有助于维护网络空间的公信力。

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when
subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer
the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of
composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of
tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and
traceability.

*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Ivan Andonovic,Christos Tachtatzis,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的恶意软件分类方法，通过将二进制文件转换为1D信号而非传统的2D图像，减少信息损失，并达到了状态质异的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的恶意软件分类方法存在显著的局限性：静态分析方法容易被现代混淆技术突破，而动态分析则资源消耗过大。虽然将恶意软件转换为2D图像的方法在检测混淆恶意软件方面更有效，但这种转换过程会造成重大的信息损失，包括量化噪声和不存在于原始数据中的2D依赖关系，这些信息损失限制了下游模型的分类性能。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过将恶意软件二进制文件转换为1D信号而非传统的2D图像。这种方法避免了需要偶然的重新形状过程，并且由于信号以浮点数格式存储，不会受到量化噪声的影响。研究还展示了现有的2D CNN架构如何简单地适配来分类这些1D信号。此外，还开发了一个专门的1D卷积神经网络，该网络基于ResNet架构和压缩-激活层，并在MalNet数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 这种新方法在MalNet数据集上达到了状态质异的性能水平，在二元、类型和家族级别分类中分别获得了高达0.874、0.503和0.507的F1分数。

Conclusion: 这项研究为未来模型在提出的信号模态上运行掌控了道路，通过减少信息损失和避免传统方法的局限性，从而提高了恶意软件分类的效果。

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LocoMamba是一个基于选择性状态空间模型(Mamba)的视觉驱动跨模态DRL框架，实现了近线性时间序列建模，能有效捕捉长距离依赖关系，支持更长序列的高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法在长序列建模中的计算效率低、内存占用大以及对长距离依赖关系捕捉不足的问题，需要开发一个能够高效处理视觉和本体感知信息融合的强化学习框架。

Method: 1) 使用多层感知机嵌入本体感知状态，轻量级CNN处理深度图像生成紧凑token；2) 堆叠Mamba层通过选择性扫描融合token，降低延迟和内存占用；3) 使用PPO算法在随机化地形和外观下进行端到端策略训练，采用障碍物密度课程学习和状态中心奖励函数。

Result: 在具有静态/动态障碍物和不平地形的模拟环境中，相比最先进基线方法，LocoMamba获得更高回报和成功率，碰撞更少，对未见地形和障碍物密度具有更强泛化能力，在相同计算预算下以更少更新次数收敛。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架通过选择性状态空间模型实现了高效的跨模态序列建模，在机器人导航任务中表现出优越的性能、泛化能力和训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

TL;DR: ManipDreamer3D是一个新颖的框架，通过结合3D轨迹规划和重建的3D占据地图，从输入图像和文本指令生成逼真的3D感知机器人操作视频，解决了现有方法依赖2D轨迹导致的3D空间模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作领域面临数据稀缺的挑战，现有基于扩散模型的方法主要依赖2D轨迹，存在3D空间模糊问题，需要开发能够生成具有合理3D轨迹的机器人操作视频的方法。

Method: 首先从输入图像重建3D占据表示，然后计算优化的3D末端执行器轨迹（最小化路径长度并避免碰撞），接着使用潜在编辑技术从初始图像潜在和优化轨迹创建视频序列，通过专门训练的轨迹到视频扩散模型生成机器人拾取放置视频。

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D成功解决了3D空间模糊问题，为机器人操作视频生成提供了有效的3D感知解决方案，在视觉质量和轨迹规划方面表现出色。

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Result: 提供了定性比较结果，展示了LLMs在不同真实边缘案例中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLMs作为自动驾驶车辆异常检测器的潜在应用前景和发现。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了物体间可供性学习问题，通过结合视觉基础模型和LLMs，为机器人理解物体交互关系和生成任务特定约束函数提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Conclusion: SKEL为野外生物力学研究提供了新工具，同时为视觉和图形学研究提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型，能够将现有的人体姿态和形状数据集升级为包含生物力学参数。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出一种基于函数空间距离约束的新正则化方法，通过模拟OOD样本来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时引入一致性正则化来增强微调模型的稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒微调方法无法在不同模型架构中一致提升OOD鲁棒性，因为它们无法很好地代理函数空间中的优化

Method: 提出两种正则化：1）在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离；2）一致性正则化促进扰动样本的稳定预测

Result: 在各种CLIP骨干网络上一致提升了下游任务的ID性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中直接约束模型行为，能更有效地保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，为鲁棒微调提供了新思路

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于大语言模型的智能压缩系统，通过性能分析和智能决策实现模型剪枝和量化，在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统压缩方法采用统一启发式策略，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用LLM构建模块化多智能体系统，结合静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）进行分析，设计特定架构的剪枝和动态量化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，剪枝保持竞争力或提升精度（ImageNet-1K下降约1%，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%），量化实现最高74%内存节省和1.74倍推理加速，精度损失<0.5%。

Conclusion: 智能系统可作为性能分析指导的模型优化的可扩展解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

TL;DR: 本文研究共形预测在量化偶然不确定性方面的有效性，发现其预测集大小与人类标注者标注的标签数量相关性很弱，表明共形预测在捕捉偶然不确定性方面能力有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管共形预测的预测集大小预期能捕捉偶然不确定性，但缺乏实证证据验证这一属性。文献中存在相互矛盾的观点，需要系统评估共形预测器量化数据集中间类重叠引起的固有模糊性的能力

Method: 通过测量预测集大小与每个实例人类标注者分配的不同标签数量之间的相关性来评估。使用三种共形预测方法为八个深度学习模型生成预测集，这些模型在四个包含多人标注（5-50人）的数据集上训练

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注显示非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数显示中等相关性。预测集与人类提供的标注相似性有限

Conclusion: 虽然共形预测可以提供更高的真实类覆盖，但其捕捉偶然不确定性的能力仍然有限，需要重新评估共形预测器生成的预测集

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

<details>

Motivation: 深度网络常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低有效容量并阻碍泛化，现有指标只能间接证明冗余问题

Method: 通过分析潜在表示的耦合矩阵，比较其非对角线统计量与正态分布的能量距离，构建紧凑、可解释的统计基础冗余度量

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证，低rho(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重建误差，高冗余与性能崩溃相关，TPE优先探索低rho区域

Conclusion: rho(C)揭示了冗余作为跨模型和任务的通用瓶颈，为评估和改进学习表示效率提供了理论视角和实用工具

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.
