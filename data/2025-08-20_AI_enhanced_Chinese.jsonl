While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOLO11-CR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u75b2\u52b3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CAFM\u548cRCM\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728DSM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u75b2\u52b3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6216\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faYOLO11-CR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CAFM\uff08\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u548cRCM\uff08\u77e9\u5f62\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DSM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea687.17%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738783.86%\uff0cmAP@50\u4e3a88.09%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "YOLO11-CR\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f7d\u75b2\u52b3\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their deployment is hindered by the significant\ncomputational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view\nimages, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.\nThis overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during\nencoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose\nPrune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs\nin autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a\ndiversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,\nwhich prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than\nrelying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller\nthat learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their\nimportance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does\nnot require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible\nwith modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that\nPrune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining\nor improving task performance.

Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks.

We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves\nstrong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00.

The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set.

However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

Existing methods have attempted to infer the\nintrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two\nmajor challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive\npriors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other\nmodels intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited\ninterpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations.

In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency.

We\nintroduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept\nRepresentations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide\nmodels toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation.

They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

Code and data: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RotBench", "summary": "We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can\naccurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\\deg}, 90{\\deg},\n180{\\deg}, and 270{\\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}.

However, further development of LLM-based analog\nICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog\nICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than\ntext-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to\nenrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion\nframeworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of\nimage styles and circuit elements.

To this\nend, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of\ncircuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog\nICs.

However, a falsely\ndetected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive\nenvironments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.\nTherefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false\npositive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly\nfocus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge\nof the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,\nwe propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the\nhistorical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in\nchallenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used\nto estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization.

Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model.

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos.

Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as\ninput, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,\neliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus\nsimplifying workflows.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes\npre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual\nlearning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different\ndomains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring\nlarge datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied\nCONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that\nenables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,\nand modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes\nin isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.\nThrough careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically\nexpand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives\nwithout catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate\nour approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for\nclassification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved\nperformance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually\nincorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\\% improvement in Dice score compared to\nrespective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not\ninherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving\nthe way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "UNICON\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUNICON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUNICON\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9884\u540e\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cPET\u626b\u63cf\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u901a\u7528AI\u6a21\u578b\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}
