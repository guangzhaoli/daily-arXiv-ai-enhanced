Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

### [2] [PixFoundation 2.0: Do Video Multi-Modal LLMs Use Motion in Visual Grounding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02807)
*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

Method: 作者提出了四种以运动为中心的探测技术，并开发了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，以评估视频MLLMs在区分真实与虚假运动及理解运动顺序方面的能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于单帧图像的基线方法与现有方法性能相当或更优，而简单的运动中心适应技术在新基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了运动在视频MLLMs中的重要性，并提出了未来模型在密集时空定位和像素级理解方面的改进方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

*Sadra Saremi,Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合胶囊网络、图注意力机制、Transformer模块和残差学习的混合多尺度深度学习架构，用于结肠癌分类，性能优于标准架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠癌早期检测至关重要，但现有方法在捕捉多尺度特征方面存在不足。

Method: 采用HG-TNet模型，结合Transformer和CNN分支，分别提取全局和局部特征，并通过自监督旋转预测目标增强表示。

Result: 在LC25000数据集上表现优于标准架构，尤其在准确率和空间信息保留方面。

Conclusion: 混合架构有效提升了结肠癌分类性能，为早期诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的主动视频采集框架，用于优化主动脉狭窄诊断中的超声视频选择，提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉狭窄（AS）诊断中，超声心动图（echo）资源有限，尤其在偏远地区。点式超声（POCUS）虽更易获取，但受限于操作者技术和视图选择。

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态选择每位患者最具信息量的超声视频，优化成像需求评估。

Result: 在2572名患者数据上测试，分类准确率达80.6%，仅需47%的超声视频。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了AS诊断的效率和可扩展性，为个性化超声评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

TL;DR: LiGuard是一个开源软件框架，旨在简化基于激光雷达的研究项目开发，减少代码重复，支持快速开发和共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决激光雷达研究中代码重复和修改困难的问题。

Method: 提供内置支持数据I/O、预处理/后处理和常用算法，支持交互式调整和可视化。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了LiGuard的有效性。

Conclusion: LiGuard能显著提高研究效率，促进代码共享和重用。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR感知系统依赖大规模标注数据集，但数据标注成本高且耗时，限制了系统的可扩展性。Sim2Real学习是一种替代方案，但其效果依赖于模拟的真实性。

Method: 提出了一种可重复的方法论，利用卫星图像和OpenStreetMap等开源资源，结合特定传感器配置，构建高保真数字孪生环境，生成合成数据集。

Conclusion: 高保真数字孪生环境为LiDAR感知系统提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术能有效提升仿真数据在真实LiDAR感知任务中的可靠性，为智能交通系统提供支持。

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，用于糖尿病视网膜病变分类，通过结合视觉Transformer和专家指导的符号推理，显著提升了跨域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布变化下泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 结合临床病变本体和视网膜血管分割的规则特征，通过置信度加权策略与深度视觉表示融合，最小化域嵌入的KL散度。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，跨域准确率提升5.2%，符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%准确率，神经符号集成在SDG中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

habitat monitoring, traffic flow optimization, and public safety improvements
through accurate identification of small objects like vehicles and pedestrians.
DDR-Net significantly reduces the cost and time required for data collection
and training, offering efficient performance even with limited data. Empirical
assessments over assorted aerial avian imagery datasets demonstrate that
DDR-Net markedly surpasses RetinaNet and alternative contemporary models. These
innovations advance current aerial image analysis technologies and promise
wide-ranging impacts across multiple sectors including agriculture, security,

### [10] [STAR: A Fast and Robust Rigid Registration Framework for Serial Histopathological Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02952)
*Zeyu Liu,Shengwei Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR是一个快速、鲁棒的开源框架，用于多全切片组织病理学图像的刚性配准，适用于多种染色协议和组织类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖计算密集且难以复现的复杂变形或深度学习方法，而轻量级刚性框架在连续切片场景中仍未被充分开发。

Method: STAR集成了染色条件预处理、分层粗到细相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制，实现跨异质组织类型和染色协议的可靠刚性配准。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个轻量级开源工具，降低了临床应用的障碍，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了可复现的基线。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来提升太阳细丝分割的准确性，特别是在捕捉细丝边界和倒钩结构方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细丝结构（尤其是倒钩）时因无法建模长程依赖和空间细节而表现不佳。

Method: EdgeAttNet通过将边缘信息线性变换为注意力机制中的Key和Query矩阵，增强空间敏感性和分割准确性。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet优于U-Net和其他基于U-Net的Transformer基线，分割精度更高且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: EdgeAttNet通过显式整合结构先验，显著提升了细丝分割的准确性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

TL;DR: KEPT是一个知识增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合时间频率-空间融合编码器和检索增强的链式思维提示，实现了高精度的短时轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在场景动态和领域知识方面的推理能力不足，影响了自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，KEPT在开环协议下表现优异，平均L2误差和碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: 检索增强的链式思维引导视觉语言模型为自动驾驶提供了一条高效、可解释且可信的路径。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

TL;DR: InstaDA是一种无需训练的双代理系统，通过LLM和扩散模型的协作增强实例分割数据集，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高和类别不平衡问题，现有方法缺乏LLM与扩散模型的深度协作，且未充分利用现有数据信息。

Method: 提出Text-Agent（T-Agent）和Image-Agent（I-Agent），分别通过Prompt Rethink机制和基于训练图像生成新实例来增强数据多样性和分布。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，InstaDA比基线提升了+4.0（box AP）和+3.3（mask AP），并优于DiverGen模型。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双代理系统有效提升了实例分割数据质量，且无需训练，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型方法在少样本医学图像分割中通常生成单一全局原型，忽略了类内变化，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: 提出SPENet，包含多级原型生成模块（MPG）和查询引导的局部原型增强模块（QLPE），分别生成多粒度原型并优化匹配过程。

Result: 在三个公开医学数据集上的实验表明，SPENet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多级原型和查询引导的优化，有效提升了少样本医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: SOPSeg填补了小物体实例分割的研究空白，并提供了专用数据集和模型。

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Result: 实验表明，空间域CNN与频域Transformer的组合效果最佳，在WAVES基准测试中显著提升了基线方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了后处理水印的鲁棒性，特别是在再生攻击中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: LVLMs often misinterpret text inputs without visual evidence as part of the image, leading to errors. The study identifies VA neurons that detect visual absence and proposes a method to refine outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs mistakenly treat text inputs as visually grounded, causing incorrect responses. The goal is to address this issue by identifying internal mechanisms for detecting visual absence.

Method: Identified VA neurons signaling visual absence, developed a detection module, and proposed a method to refine outputs by reinterpreting prompts or replacing absent tokens.

Result: The method effectively reduces LVLMs' tendency to falsely assume visual presence of text inputs, showing generality across models.

Conclusion: The study successfully mitigates LVLMs' errors by leveraging VA neurons and refining output generation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义在行人重识别中具有重要价值，联合建模前景和背景信息的策略能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Result: 在去雾和可见光-红外融合等病态多任务场景中，在多个指标上取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 动态条件双扩散桥训练范式在多任务场景中表现出优越性，特别是在病态任务中。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten

techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural

Motivation: 手写字符因其复杂和草书的特性，比简单和非草书字符更难分类。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）生成假手写字符图像，并通过添加对抗性扰动噪声增强训练数据，结合外部分类器进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，传统卷积神经网络的分类准确率随字符复杂度增加而下降，而ADA-GAN对复杂和草书字符的分类更鲁棒有效。

Conclusion: ADA-GAN在分类复杂和草书手写字符方面表现出色，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了后门投毒在人脸反欺骗检测中的潜在风险，需引起重视。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别视为独立任务，而实际上变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来。

Method: CAIM-Net包括三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗变化时刻提取、精细变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。

Result: CAIM-Net通过时间序列分析和空间变化检测的内在关系，实现了变化区域和变化时刻的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，提供了一种更一致的时间序列变化检测方法。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题主要由文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差引起，现有方法未能动态评估偏差水平。

Method: 使用梯度自反思方法估计视觉、提示和先前输出token的影响，检测视觉token并整合到影响感知的对比解码框架中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少幻觉，在LLaVA-QA90上准确率提升高达92%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需额外资源即可有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理上合理的交互，避免穿透，确保稳定抓取，并捕捉真实变形。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法在手-物体交互中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种3D时间感知扩散模型（TADM-3D），用于预测MRI脑部结构变化，解决了现有方法在时间关系建模和3D上下文利用上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测脑部结构变化时存在局限性，如时间关系建模不足、仅依赖扫描插值或忽略3D解剖上下文。TADM-3D旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TADM-3D结合预训练的脑龄估计器（BAE）和双向时间正则化（BITR），通过扩散模型生成反映时间变化的MRI。

Result: 在OASIS-3和NACC数据集上验证了TADM-3D的准确性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够更准确地预测脑部结构变化，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数（Negative Centerline Loss和Simplified Topology Loss），用于提升生物医学分割任务中结构的连续性，并在3D荧光显微镜数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比逐体素精度更重要，但现有方法容易因信号丢失导致分割不连续。

Method: 设计了两种新的损失函数，结合实验设计（如降采样和间距校正），应用于卷积神经网络（CNNs）。

Result: 在3D荧光显微镜数据集上，新方法显著减少了分割不连续的情况，尤其在信号缺失区域，提升了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过损失函数嵌入结构先验，可以显著提升生物医学分割的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

TL;DR: Count2Density提出了一种仅需计数级标注即可预测密度图的新方法，通过历史图库和自监督对比空间正则化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对细粒度标注的依赖，解决标注耗时且难以扩展的问题。

Method: 利用历史图库生成伪密度图，结合超几何分布采样和自监督对比正则化。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于跨域适应方法和半监督最新方法。

Conclusion: Count2Density能有效从计数级标注中提取空间信息，实现准确子区域计数。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

TL;DR: 论文研究了军事领域中针对目标检测系统的投毒攻击及其检测方法，提出了新的检测方法AutoDetect，并呼吁建立更多代表性数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 军事领域中AI系统的投毒攻击威胁日益严重，但相关研究较少，尤其是目标检测系统的投毒攻击及其检测方法。

Method: 通过创建军事车辆数据集MilCivVeh，实施改进的BadDet投毒攻击，并测试了多种检测方法，最终提出AutoDetect方法。

Result: 投毒攻击虽有效但需大量数据支持；AutoDetect在检测性能上优于现有方法，且更高效。

Conclusion: 军事领域需要更多代表性数据集以进一步评估投毒攻击风险，AutoDetect为检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

TL;DR: PPORLD-EDNetLDCT是一种基于强化学习的低剂量CT图像去噪方法，显著提升了图像质量和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射，但噪声增加、图像质量下降，传统去噪方法效果不佳。

Method: 采用动态强化学习（RL）方法，结合后验策略优化（PPO）算法，通过编码器-解码器结构实时优化去噪策略。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR达41.87，SSIM为0.9814，RMSE为0.00236，分类任务准确率提升至94%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LDCT成像提供了更安全、更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）仅能处理单模态文本，无法捕捉非语言情感信号，限制了人机交互的共情能力。

Method: 提出多模态情感感知网络（MSPN），采用跨模态融合Transformer和监督对比学习，结合情感感知提示工程和TTS系统。

Result: 开发了情感感知代理框架，支持情感对齐的交互，适用于伴侣机器人、心理健康等领域。

Conclusion: 该研究为情感感知AI代理提供了可行方案，拓展了LLMs在多模态交互中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI在临床诊断中面临信噪比低、个体差异大以及现有模型频率感知有限的问题，且缺乏文本注释。

Method: RTGMFF包含ROI驱动的文本生成、混合频率-空间编码器和自适应语义对齐模块。

Result: 在ADHD-200和ABIDE基准测试中，RTGMFF在敏感性、特异性和ROC曲线下面积方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过多模态融合和文本生成，显著提升了脑部疾病诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling
methods risk compromising their structure. Therefore, this paper proposes an
automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We
introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for

Result: 在大型公共数据集上的肿瘤分割任务中，该方法使常见分割模型的Dice Score提升了2-3%。

Conclusion: SynBT模型能够生成高质量乳腺肿瘤，显著提升MRI图像中的肿瘤分割性能。

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

Motivation: 将CLIP的2D泛化能力迁移到3D异常检测中，以识别具有高度多样性的未见物体的3D异常。

Method: 设计了PointAD和PointAD+框架，分别利用隐式（渲染像素）和显式（空间关系）3D表示，并通过分层表示学习和跨层次对比对齐来捕捉异常语义。

Result: PointAD+在未见物体的3D异常检测中表现出色，能够全面理解异常性，并通过RGB信息进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合渲染和几何异常语义，实现了对3D异常的全面检测和分割，为跨类别3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Conclusion: 长CoT数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLMs推理能力的关键前提。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上，砖级分割效果显著提升。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion展示了在砖石资产自动检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时捕捉全局依赖和局部细节，导致长程交互和边界细节难以兼顾。

Method: 提出T-CAGU框架，利用Transformer捕捉全局依赖，内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，并整合多传播顺序动态学习图结构。

Result: 实验证明T-CAGU优于现有方法，且对噪声鲁棒。

Conclusion: T-CAGU通过结合全局和局部信息，显著提升了高光谱解混的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

*Guoxin Wang,Qingyuan Wang,Binhua Huang,Shaowu Chen,Deepu John*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyDrop是一种无需训练、基于轻量级视觉模型的ViT令牌丢弃框架，可显著降低计算成本且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）在图像分类中表现优异，但计算成本高，尤其是处理所有图像令牌时。

Method: 提出TinyDrop框架，通过轻量级视觉模型动态评估令牌重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性令牌以减少计算量。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，TinyDrop将ViTs的FLOPs降低高达80%，且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: TinyDrop具有通用性和实用性，为高效ViT分类提供了无需修改架构的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D-GPTScore的新评估方法，用于解决概念定制评估中的挑战，并发布了CC-AlignBench基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标在评估生成图像时与人类偏好不一致，难以全面评估多概念交互。

Method: 提出D-GPTScore方法，将评估标准分解为更细的方面，并利用多模态大语言模型进行分项评估。

Result: D-GPTScore在CC-AlignBench上显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好相关性更高。

Conclusion: 该研究为概念定制评估设立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark
and associated materials are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且松散耦合的多模态框架，用于整合多种数据源以改进乳腺癌分子分型，适用于其他癌症类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床环境中可用的模态因地点和患者而异，多模态整合可提升乳腺癌分子分型的准确性，从而促进个性化治疗。

Method: 采用双基表示法整合全切片图像（WSI）的传统图像和基于图的表示，并提出新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 结合双基WSI表示、CNV和临床记录的多模态框架在乳腺癌分型中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活、可扩展，且无需重新训练现有模态，适用于多种癌症类型。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSMs）的新方法，用于解决密集视频描述任务中的长视频处理问题，支持在线处理并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时面临计算复杂性和内存限制，且需要完整视频输入，无法支持在线处理。

Method: 通过时间扩展状态空间模型（SSMs），结合其长序列和递归特性，提出带有转移状态的状态空间模型（State-Space Models with Transfer State），以支持更长时间上下文。

Result: 该方法在密集视频描述任务中表现良好，支持在线处理，且计算开销减少7倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长视频处理问题，适用于在线场景，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低信噪比EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的挑战，利用文本模态提升语义对应关系。

Method: 提出适配器模块优化高维表征稳定性，引入模态一致性动态平衡策略（MCDB）和随机扰动正则化（SPR）增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，Top-1和Top-5准确率分别提升2.0%和4.7%，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和动态优化策略，显著提升了EEG信号解码视觉内容的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

TL;DR: JTGD是一种联合训练图像生成器和检测器的方法，用于道路缺陷检测，适用于边缘设备，性能优于现有方法且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路缺陷检测对减少车辆损坏至关重要，但现有方法通常需要大量计算资源，不适合边缘设备。

Method: JTGD通过联合训练生成器和检测器，使用双重判别器和CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance损失提升合成图像质量。

Result: JTGD在RDD2022基准测试中表现优于现有方法，参数数量仅为基线的20%。

Conclusion: JTGD是一种高效且轻量级的道路缺陷检测方法，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于像素空间视觉提示的参数高效适应方法，用于无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA），仅训练少量参数（<0.01%基础模型），性能媲美全微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统NR-IQA方法需要大量参数微调的问题，探索多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在低层视觉任务中的高效适应。

Method: 通过像素空间优化的视觉提示与图像结合，使用mPLUG-Owl2处理文本查询，仅训练600K参数。

Result: 在KADID-10k、KonIQ-10k和AGIQA-3k数据集上表现优异，KADID-10k的SRCC达0.93。

Conclusion: 首次将像素空间视觉提示用于NR-IQA，为低层视觉任务提供了高效的MLLM适应方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level
vision tasks. The source code is publicly available at https: // github. com/

Motivation: 消除对外部组件（如ViT或视觉分词器）的依赖，提高高分辨率输入的效率，探索纯自回归模型在多模态智能中的潜力。

Method: 采用模态特定的混合专家（MoE）结构和多尺度视觉自回归机制，通过单一自回归目标训练。

Result: 在多项基准测试中优于现有开源统一多模态模型，支持动态分辨率并减少解码步骤。

Conclusion: OneCAT展示了纯自回归模型作为统一多模态智能基础的强大潜力，并设定了新的性能标准。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时空推理方面表现不足，尤其是在依赖时间事件或手势线索的查询中。

Conclusion: Strefer为视频大语言模型提供了时空感知推理的新基础，无需依赖专有模型或大量人工标注。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估文本到图像模型的组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法应对复杂场景和多步推理的需求。

Method: 围绕场景图元素（实例、属性和关系）和哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳和溯因）构建12维评估分类，并设计高密度组合和多步推理的提示。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力有限，推理能力更是瓶颈，所有模型均难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench为文本到图像模型提供了更全面和复杂的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是推理能力的不足。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Abstract: Automated detection and classification of mitotic figures especially
distinguishing atypical from normal remain critical challenges in computational
pathology. We present MitoDetect++, a unified deep learning pipeline designed
for the MIDOG 2025 challenge, addressing both mitosis detection and atypical
mitosis classification. For detection (Track 1), we employ a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with EfficientNetV2-L as the backbone, enhanced
with attention modules, and trained via combined segmentation losses. For
classification (Track 2), we leverage the Virchow2 vision transformer,
fine-tuned efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize resource
consumption. To improve generalization and mitigate domain shifts, we integrate
strong augmentations, focal loss, and group-aware stratified 5-fold
cross-validation. At inference, we deploy test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost
robustness. Our method achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.892 across validation
domains, highlighting its clinical applicability and scalability across tasks.

Abstract: Accurate mitotic figure classification is crucial in computational pathology,
as mitotic activity informs cancer grading and patient prognosis.
Distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which indicate higher tumor
aggressiveness, from normal mitotic figures (NMFs) remains challenging due to
subtle morphological differences and high intra-class variability. This task is
further complicated by domain shifts, including variations in organ, tissue
type, and scanner, as well as limited annotations and severe class imbalance.
To address these challenges in Track 2 of the MIDOG 2025 Challenge, we propose
a solution based on the lightweight ConvNeXt architecture, trained on all
available datasets (AMi-Br, AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD, and OMG-Octo) to maximize
domain coverage. Robustness is enhanced through a histopathology-specific
augmentation pipeline, including elastic and stain-specific transformations,
and balanced sampling to mitigate class imbalance. A grouped 5-fold
cross-validation strategy ensures reliable evaluation. On the preliminary
leaderboard, our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8961, ranking among
the top entries. These results highlight that broad domain exposure combined
with targeted augmentation strategies is key to building accurate and
generalizable mitotic figure classifiers.

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by
introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to
distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a
clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We
investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on
ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via
self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.
1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate
class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic
data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong
performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving
slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.
Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the
organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an
out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4
percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These
findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable
for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring
robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive
synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be
reported upon challenge completion.

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection remains a challenging task in computational
pathology due to domain variability and morphological complexity. This paper
describes our participation in the MIDOG 2025 challenge, focusing on robust
mitotic figure detection across diverse tissue domains. We developed a
two-stage pipeline combining Faster R-CNN for candidate detection with an
ensemble of three classifiers (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-v2,

F1-score 0.2237 (Recall: 0.9528, Precision: 0.1267) using a Faster R-CNN
trained solely on MIDOG++ dataset. While our high recall demonstrates effective
mitotic figure detection, the critically low precision (12.67%) reveals
fundamental challenges in distinguishing true mitoses from morphologically
similar imposters across diverse domains. Analysis of six submission variants
showed that subsequent optimization attempts were counterproductive,
highlighting the omplexity of domain generalization in histopathology. This
work provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of developing
robust mitotic figure detection algorithms and emphasizes the importance of
effective false positive suppression strategies.

The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating
detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of
generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the
performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on

stain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In
internal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided
improved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and
anchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we
employed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.

Result: 在BTCV数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了边界敏感区域的分割精度。

Conclusion: 混合生成-判别训练机制在小器官分割中表现优异，为数据稀缺场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: Segmentation of small and irregularly shaped abdominal organs, such as the
adrenal glands in CT imaging, remains a persistent challenge due to severe
class imbalance, poor spatial context, and limited annotated data. In this
work, we propose a unified framework that combines variational reconstruction,
supervised segmentation, and adversarial patch-based feedback to address these
limitations in a principled and scalable manner. Our architecture is built upon
a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates
voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled
representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a
patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches
generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects
of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance
output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss
using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial
supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset
demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in
boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative
training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into
balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce
scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型（如DINOv2和DINOv3）是否能够替代领域特定的预训练模型（如RETFound）在视网膜图像应用中的表现。

Method: 通过微调和线性探测两种适应策略，评估DINOv2、DINOv3与RETFound-MAE、RETFound-DINOv2在眼部疾病检测和全身疾病预测中的性能。

Result: RETFound-DINOv2在眼部疾病检测和眼组学任务中表现优于通用基础模型，具有更强的泛化能力和数据效率。

Conclusion: 领域特定的视网膜基础模型在临床应用中仍是最佳选择，但通用基础模型的差距正在缩小，未来可能成为医学基础模型的强有力候选。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data,
demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications.
RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this
approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of
increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as
DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training
remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image
applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and
RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and
systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and
linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed
to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational
cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong
adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms
these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics
tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These
findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most
effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with
generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can
deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for
future medical foundation models.

Motivation: 检测非仪器化日常表面的触摸事件是混合现实系统的长期目标，虚拟界面绑定物理表面比空中点击界面更具性能和人体工学优势。

Method: 结合计算机触发的摄像头和一个或多个红外发射器，生成结构化阴影，用于估计悬停距离和触摸接触。

Result: 悬停距离的平均误差为6.9毫米，触摸接触的准确率为98.0%。

Conclusion: 该技术在不同表面材料、交互方向和环境光照条件下均表现良好。

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

Motivation: 现有系统依赖摄像头或多传感器，存在隐私和便利性问题，需要更便捷的解决方案。

Method: 结合智能手机和智能手表的惯性数据与超宽带测距功能，通过软件算法估计手臂姿态。

Result: 在无需用户提供训练数据的情况下，手腕和肘关节的中位位置误差为11.0厘米。

Conclusion: 该方法为消费者提供了一种隐私友好且便捷的手臂姿态跟踪方案。

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

Result: 二分类模型准确率88%（平衡后89%），多分类模型准确率52%（平衡后62%。量子电路限制影响了多分类性能。

Conclusion: QCNN在二分类中表现良好，但多分类需优化量子电路架构或结合经典方法，以提升临床适用性。

Abstract: This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks
(QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum
computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images,
including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was
utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an
oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model
consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with
a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two
models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor
presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The
binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,
while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after
oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass
model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit
limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging
applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further
refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid
classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass
classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 结合基础模型嵌入和先进分类策略可构建鲁棒且通用的乳腺癌MRI分析工具。

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model
embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and
generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.

Motivation: 解决多模态学习中缺失模态和标签数据有限的挑战，以提升模型的鲁棒性和适应性。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证了Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景中的优越性能。

Conclusion: Robult的轻量级设计使其适用于实际多模态应用，并能无缝集成现有架构。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在自动驾驶中预测变道轨迹时，通常直接输出原始坐标，缺乏物理合理性和可解释性。SAM-LLM旨在通过参数化方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过微调LLM，使其输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数（如横向位移、持续时间等），而非原始坐标。对于变道场景，使用增强的正弦加速度模型（SAM）生成参数。

Result: SAM-LLM在意图预测准确率上达到98.73%，输出大小减少80%，同时保持了与传统LLM预测器相当的性能。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在自动驾驶轨迹预测中实现了高性能、可解释性和计算效率的平衡，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

Conclusion: DUViN通过知识迁移和两阶段训练，实现了无需预建地图的水下导航，具有较好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络在自主系统中应用广泛，但面对持续变化的领域时泛化能力不足，且现有测试时训练方法推理时间过长。

Method: 利用不确定性感知的自监督任务，选择性应用训练，减少推理时间，同时保持性能。

Result: 在单目深度估计任务中表现优异，推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: UT³框架在保持性能的同时显著降低推理时间，适用于资源受限的实时应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

<details>

Motivation: 传统深度LiDAR里程计模型需要大量多样化训练数据以适应不同环境，导致效率低下。

Method: 采用初始训练集选择（ITSS）和主动增量选择（AIS）策略，分别从一般天气和复杂天气条件下选择性提取训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需52%的序列数据即可达到全数据集训练的性能，证明了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LiDAR里程计系统提供了更高效和可靠的训练方法，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.
