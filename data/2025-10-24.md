### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过二维离散傅里叶变换揭示周期性伪影，ResNet50模型在频域上达到92.8%准确率和0.95 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实图像和合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，利用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练，检测GAN图像特有的周期性伪影特征。

Result: 频域模型准确率达到92.8%，AUC为0.95，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的同等模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征指纹，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度增强方面具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合在3D形状特征表示学习中的效果，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，证明了该方法能克服CNN的局限性并减少对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临的挑战，包括需要大量标注数据以及CNN可能忽略重要形状关系的局限性。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标（包括监督对比学习和自监督对比学习）相结合的方法，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT捕捉全局形状语义与对比学习优化局部判别特征的结合，为3D表示学习提供了有效的解决方案，通过大量实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上实现多模态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法在多模态场景下性能有限，需要开发能够充分利用相机和LiDAR多模态特征的跟踪框架，以应对遮挡和视角变化等挑战。

Method: 采用基于查询的两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，包括时序平滑器对边界框序列进行轨迹优化，以及融合跟踪器集成多模态BEV特征进行身份分配和传播。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上验证，nuScenes测试集aMOTA达到74.7，显著减少身份切换，在多目标跟踪基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: FutrTrack证明了基于transformer的查询跟踪方法能够从多模态传感器特征中显著受益，提供了一种无需预训练即可与神经网络方法竞争的框架。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑（OLS）是一种动态调整软标签的方法，能提高医学图像分类的准确性和校准性，相比传统方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，传统标签平滑方法未考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑（OLS）动态调整软标签，在RadImageNet数据集上评估ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于传统方法，并产生更紧凑、分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅能提升预测性能，还能改善校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对鱼眼图像的目标检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道以及模型集成策略，有效解决了鱼眼图像中的径向失真和非均匀分辨率问题，在AI City Challenge Track 4中取得了第8名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机虽然能够从单一视角捕捉大范围视野，但其固有的强径向失真和非均匀分辨率特性，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化的情况下，给标准目标检测器带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 1. 设计了一个简单而有效的预处理和后处理管道，提高图像中检测的一致性；2. 在鱼眼交通图像上训练多个最先进的检测模型；3. 通过集成策略结合这些模型的输出以提高整体检测精度。

Result: 在2025年AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62支参赛队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对3D高斯溅射模型在训练分布外视角渲染时出现视觉噪声问题的实时渲染感知过滤方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射模型在训练数据分布之外的视角渲染时会产生严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致模型在密度、颜色和几何预测上的不确定性

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题

Result: 实验评估表明该方法在视觉质量、真实感和一致性方面相比现有基于NeRF的方法有显著提升，并能实时集成到现有3DGS渲染流程中

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决3DGS模型在训练分布外视角的渲染质量问题，为3D重建系统提供更好的自由导航体验

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出BrainPuzzle混合框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，通过两阶段方法实现定量经颅超声脑成像，解决了传统方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声脑成像面临颅骨与脑组织声速差异大、探头耦合困难等挑战。传统物理方法受颅骨衰减和稀疏孔径限制，纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比条件下产生定量偏差。

Method: 两阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段采用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段，结合图注意力单元生成准确SoS图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在SoS重建精度和图像完整性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle框架展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，提高了临床可行性。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过标准化评估框架，揭示了生成式图像模型在文化表示方面的系统性偏见，发现T2I系统默认偏向全球北方现代风格，而I2I编辑会进一步削弱文化保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而对图像到图像编辑器的文化偏差研究不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，建立可比较的诊断标准。

Method: 使用开放模型和固定设置，结合标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的判断，对六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别的统一评估。

Result: 发现三个主要结果：(1) 国家无关提示下模型偏向全球北方现代描绘；(2) 迭代I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；(3) I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非情境感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统的文化敏感编辑不可靠，通过发布标准化数据、提示和评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR是一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件数据重建强度图像，相比神经网络方法更简单且可在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件相机图像重建方法通常依赖GPU上的神经网络，计算复杂且资源消耗大。FIBAR旨在提供一种更简单、异步且可在CPU上高效运行的替代方案。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器积分事件信号强度变化，通过新颖的陈旧像素检测算法减少重建噪声，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波，利用移动相机中事件缺失可能意味着低图像梯度的特性。

Result: FIBAR在现代笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度约4200万事件/秒（启用空间滤波）或1.4亿事件/秒（未启用），比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在特定应用场景下具有实用价值，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过数据自适应张量核范数和双边结构来提升图像聚类性能，并有效处理复杂噪声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换且对噪声鲁棒性差，需要开发更有效的全局相关性和局部相关性捕捉方法

Method: 引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构捕捉图像样本和特征间的局部相关性，集成ℓ₁/₂-范数和Frobenius范数正则化项处理复杂噪声，基于ADMM开发优化算法

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型通过自适应变换和双边结构设计，在图像聚类中表现出优越性能，为处理现实场景中的复杂噪声提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构和隐私问题，具有高可用性和用户接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享带来的隐私问题。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期方法，结合用户中心反馈。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私优先设计架构；测试阶段通过外部调查评估可用性和采用度，并进行硬件配置基准测试。

Result: 初始测试显示高可用性评分（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐度（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理管道，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证来成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Attentive Convolution (ATConv)的新型卷积操作，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使CNN在保持线性复杂度的同时达到甚至超越自注意力机制的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距，需要找到自注意力机制优于卷积的本质原因。

Method: 通过分析发现自注意力的两个关键优势：自适应路由和侧向抑制。基于此设计了ATConv，在3×3卷积核中注入这些原则，构建了AttNet网络家族。

Result: AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中，用ATConv替换自注意力可使ImageNet FID降低0.15，且采样速度更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积操作，证明了CNN在保持效率优势的同时可以达到甚至超越自注意力机制的性能。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督来源，通过生成合成标题来弥补生物领域缺乏大规模实例特定描述的问题，并训练了BIOCAP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物图像和描述性标题可以视为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，但获取大规模、实例特定的忠实描述是主要挑战，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和针对特定分类群的格式示例，训练BIOCAP模型（带标题的BIOCLIP）。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕获丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: LogitGap是一种新颖的OOD检测方法，通过利用最大logit与其他logits之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，无需训练即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未能充分利用模型logits空间中的丰富信息，特别是在OOD检测任务中。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，明确利用最大logit与剩余logits之间的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最具有信息量的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logits空间中的关系信息，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且无需训练的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张RGB图像进行类别级8D姿态估计的方法，用于估计自行车和骑行者的姿态，包括车把和踏板的旋转，从而更精细地估计自行车姿态状态和行驶方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于安全关键类别的弱势道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于骑行者的交叉意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统的6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车关节结构的变化，因为自行车的3D边界框会随着关节姿态的变化而变化，且3D框方向不一定与决定实际行驶方向的车把方向对齐。

Method: 提出了一种联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点的模型，使用合成和真实图像数据的混合训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。8D姿态包括自行车的3D平移和旋转，以及车把和踏板相对于自行车车架的旋转。

Result: 评估显示，该方法在估计8D姿态参数方面具有竞争力，与使用刚性规范对象模板匹配的最先进类别级6D姿态估计器相比，取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张图像估计更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向，为自动驾驶中的骑行者行为预测和安全应用提供了更准确的姿态信息。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Motivation: 现有的组合零样本学习方法在测试时面临分布偏移问题，因为测试集包含从属性和对象重新组合的未见组合，导致性能下降。

Method: 1）在测试时从无监督数据中积累文本和视觉模态的全面知识来更新多模态原型；2）设计自适应更新权重控制原型调整程度；3）引入动态优先级队列存储高置信度图像；4）通过多模态协作表示学习对齐文本和视觉原型。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，无论是封闭世界还是开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过测试时自适应更新多模态原型，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，展示了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈(IB)框架来优化GAN，以解决现有方法在解耦表示学习中的不足，提高潜在空间的可解释性和解耦性能。

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层作为可学习的潜在分布，通过约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息来实现解耦表示学习，采用端到端的联合训练方式。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上生成样本的视觉质量和多样性更好，FID分数更优。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功改进了GAN的解耦表示学习能力，在多个数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能，证明了IB框架在GAN优化中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时序一致性问题，现有方法在长距离依赖建模和计算效率之间存在权衡，需要一种既能保持长时间一致性又计算高效的方法。

Method: 提出PPM模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，维护紧凑且信息丰富的内存缓冲区。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上取得0.62/1.11 TEPE（比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%），在准确性和时序一致性方面达到最先进性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程有效解决了立体视频深度估计的时序一致性问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有的大规模视频生成模型在视觉真实性方面表现出色，但缺乏对多智能体动态合理性的验证，特别是在多行人交互场景中的评估。

Method: 开发了针对T2V和I2V模型的评估协议：对于I2V，使用现有数据集起始帧与真实视频对比；对于T2V，构建了包含不同行人密度和交互的提示套件；关键创新是无需相机参数从像素空间重建二维鸟瞰轨迹的方法。

Conclusion: 现有模型在多行人动态模拟方面表现出潜力，但需要进一步改进处理失败模式，为未来世界模拟器的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Method: FlowCycle框架通过可学习噪声参数化破坏过程，并通过循环一致性过程进行优化。采用迭代编辑源图像到目标图像并恢复回源图像的双重一致性约束，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 大量消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性约束，实现了更忠实的内容修改和更好的源图像一致性，为文本到图像编辑提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，需要开发更可靠的客观检测方法。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习框架，结合空间和时间双重对比损失，引入任务特定采样策略有效区分运动和非运动片段，并通过概率微调方法实现任意长度超声记录的灵活推理。

Result: 在包含92名受试者、每人30分钟超声会话的内部数据集上，CURL达到78.01%的敏感性和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity通过利用VQ生成模型的精确中间表示特性，实现了更准确高效的图像编辑，为文本驱动的图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出幻觉不是由长度本身引起，而是由长回答中对上下文依赖增加导致的，并提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来缓解大视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在长回答中更容易产生幻觉，传统观点认为这是由长度引起的错误累积导致的，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"三步框架：通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性，并重新验证了关于上下文依赖导致幻觉的假设。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要源于长回答中对上下文的依赖增强，而非单纯的长度因素。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长回答中的幻觉问题提供了新视角和初步解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场设计有效解决了开放词汇3D分割中的关键挑战，为各种应用提供了高质量的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: DualGround提出了一种双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时序定位任务，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频时序定位方法在处理文本时对所有token一视同仁，忽视了它们不同的语义角色。实验表明当前模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义，而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: 提出DualGround双分支架构：1）将[EOS]token通过句子级路径处理全局语义；2）将词token聚类成语义单元进行局部定位。引入token角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模方法在视频-语言对齐中具有有效性，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出了掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓，以及上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在挑战性的地面到卫星场景下实现了最先进的性能，定位精度提升了3.39%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC模型有效缓解了文本主导问题，通过多模态共识指导融合过程，在多模态情感识别任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征融合有效减少了视觉特征中的冗余信息，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将自然语言指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）优化GUI grounding性能，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI grounding方法将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时带来76%的性能提升。

Method: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径。采用两阶段训练框架：1）在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT），培养多视角推理能力；2）使用强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个grounding基准测试中达到SOTA：UI-Ins-32B在UI-I2E-Bench得87.3%，ScreenSpot-Pro得57.0%，MMBench-GUI L2得84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HyperET的高效训练范式，通过双曲空间动态调整半径来优化视觉表示，使其与文本表示在任意粒度级别对齐，从而显著提升多模态大语言模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要极高的计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP和SAM）缺乏与语言在多层次粒度上的对齐能力。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构的能力，提出HyperET训练范式，通过可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作实现动态双曲半径调整，支持三种高效参数化配置：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET能够以不到1%的额外参数，显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一种灵活且高效的参数化策略，有效解决了视觉与文本模态之间的粒度差距问题，为多模态大语言模型的训练提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的点云几何压缩方法面临泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对分布外数据处理的低效性。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验来捕捉鲁棒的上下文依赖关系；2. 实例自适应微调策略：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调网络权重子集并将其纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，代码和数据集将公开发布以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，影响生成质量。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant显式模拟扩散采样过程中的多个去噪步骤进行量化，考虑多步骤误差累积。采用高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降至O(1)。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AccuQuant在各种任务和扩散模型上展现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型提供了高效且有效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现DiTs中的patch tokens具有出乎意料的独立性，即使位置编码被扰动，DiTs仍能产生全局一致的输出，这表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。这一发现促使作者重新思考如何组织视觉内容。

Method: 引入PE-Field方法，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子patch控制的分层编码。

Result: 基于PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务上达到了最先进的性能，并能推广到可控的空间图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: PE-Field方法有效提升了DiTs在3D空间建模方面的能力，为视觉生成任务提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种因果表示学习方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素来缓解图像-食谱检索中的模态偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱细节，但实际上图像只反映最终视觉结果，忽略了烹饪过程中的细微差异，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习中以减轻偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上实验表明，该方法能发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了优秀的检索性能。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习能有效解决图像-食谱检索中的模态偏差问题，提升对细微烹饪差异的识别能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Motivation: 传统静态知识蒸馏方法使用固定权重，无法有效处理医学图像中不同区域的不确定性变化。需要一种能够动态调整蒸馏权重的方法来提高模型对模糊区域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态模糊知识蒸馏方法能有效处理医学图像分类中的不确定性，显著提升模型性能，同时通过遗传算法优化实现了计算效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个用于证据驱动的多步视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧推理以及自适应决策来解决MLLMs在视频推理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的视频推理方法依赖纯文本链，产生未基于视觉证据的结论；而基于帧检索的方法虽然引入视觉基础，但证据定位不准确。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在6个多步推理基准测试中，Conan比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct平均准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan在多步视频推理任务上表现出色，并能有效泛化到长视频理解任务，验证了其强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过公开数据集元数据、完整代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包促进透明性和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单步文本到图像扩散模型虽然生成速度快，但在个性化新概念方面存在能力不足的问题，需要解决如何在保持快速生成的同时有效学习新概念分布。

Method: 采用端到端训练方式，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和单步扩散模型（学生）。通过双向概念蒸馏机制，先由教师向学生蒸馏概念，再由学生反馈给教师。共享文本编码器确保语义一致性，并引入对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Conclusion: EchoDistill建立了一个快速有效的T2I扩散模型个性化新范式，通过双向协作机制实现了概念学习的协同提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了现有可解释深度伪造分析方法缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持对任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 1. 定义面部图像概念树(FICT)对面部进行细粒度区域划分；2. 开发FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；3. 提出Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，生成包含分割掩码的文本伪造解释；4. 设计统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度面部区域划分和新的任务定义，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出一个深度学习框架，从单张模糊图像联合估计清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，特别针对严重或空间变化的模糊问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动（尤其是大范围或旋转运动）引起的运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下效果不佳

Method: 使用可微模糊创建模块实现投影运动模糊模型，神经网络预测完整3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络，并通过后处理优化轨迹

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优于端到端去模糊网络

Conclusion: 该模块化架构提供了可解释性，能够重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，代码和训练模型已开源

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust
feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,
ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging
scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

TL;DR: ACamera-Net是一个轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，直接从RAW输入预测最佳曝光和白平衡参数，以解决消费级相机在复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件（如低光、高动态范围、背光）下难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。该网络针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下具有良好泛化能力。大量实验表明，ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法，且无需依赖额外的图像增强模块。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net为消费级相机系统提供了一种有效的实时参数调整解决方案，能够显著改善复杂光照条件下的图像质量表现。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，将显式时空证据整合到视频推理中，通过在答案旁突出显示关键时间戳、对象和边界框，使推理基于具体的视觉观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数视频推理模型仅生成文本推理轨迹，不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。现有模型如OpenAI-o3在图像证据中心推理方面引起了广泛兴趣，但将这种能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，因为它需要在动态场景中进行联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 首先策划和构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，包含精心构建的时间和空间注释。然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，结合多个专门设计的奖励函数，共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进的性能，将Qwen2.5-VL基线的mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致的改进。

Conclusion: 除了准确性之外，Open-o3 Video生成的推理轨迹还为测试时缩放提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色控制方面表现不佳，现有基准测试缺乏对颜色精度的系统性评估，而颜色在视觉感知和应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建包含44K个颜色相关提示的基准测试，涵盖400多种颜色，包括数值颜色表示，并通过感知和自动化评估方法进行分析。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在显著差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度和常见失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench将为改进精确颜色生成提供指导，基准测试将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在面对未见数据时性能急剧下降，领域自适应可以避免昂贵的新领域标注成本

Method: 学习嵌入空间中的类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且可区分，使用字典存储不同图像的原型以支持对比学习

Result: 在大量实验中取得了优于其他最先进方法的结果

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架能有效解决跨模态分割的领域自适应问题

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中自由移动物体重建的挑战，特别是在缺乏可靠姿态或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用第一帧作为锚点，通过密集高斯原语场逐步细化物体表示；核心是双键内存模块，结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导内存读取和高效稀疏化机制处理自由移动物体。

Conclusion: OnlineSplatter能够高效、高质量地重建自由移动物体，具有恒定的计算成本，适用于长视频序列。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有Video-LLMs处理长序列计算成本高且推理不聚焦不一致。现有帧选择方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整查询相关上下文。

Method: 提出训练无关、模型无关的SeViCES框架，包含两个核心模块：SVCFS模块通过时间感知语义分支（利用LLM对字幕推理）和聚类引导视觉分支（通过互信息对齐嵌入与语义分数）选择帧；ACR模块通过融合证据和约束答案空间解决语义和视觉预测的不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面 consistently 优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对Video-LLMs至关重要，SeViCES框架证明了其在长视频理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D是一种用于3D医学影像的视觉语言模型，通过改进的3D tokenization方法，在报告生成和文本到CT合成任务上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列的3D医学影像时存在困难，包括对比预训练导致的视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，以及切片级tokenization模糊精细解剖结构的问题。

Method: 提出BTB3D，一种因果卷积编码器-解码器，采用三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼，能够从短切片片段学习并泛化到超过300个切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务上，FID降低75%，FVD减半，能生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积图像。

Conclusion: 精确的三维tokenization对于3D医学影像中的可扩展视觉语言建模至关重要，比单纯使用更大的语言骨干网络更为重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared

TL;DR: 本文提出了UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知后训练方法，解决了超高分辨率文本到图像生成中缺乏高质量数据集和精细细节合成训练策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率文本到图像生成面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量UHR T2I数据集，以及忽视针对UHR场景的精细细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1）构建UltraHR-100K数据集：包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像，基于细节丰富度、内容复杂度和美学质量严格筛选；2）提出频率感知后训练方法：包括细节导向时间步采样（DOTS）和软加权频率正则化（SWFR），通过离散傅里叶变换增强高频细节保留。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提高了UHR图像生成的精细细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的数据集和训练策略有效解决了UHR T2I生成的关键挑战，为超高分辨率图像生成提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架不仅技术先进，还通过精确自动化垃圾分类支持更高回收效率，减少可回收物污染，降低处理成本，符合联合国可持续发展目标

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

TL;DR: 提出EMQNet方法，通过权重偏差校正和位级核心集采样策略，大幅减少多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多比特量化网络需要为每个支持的位宽重复全数据集更新，训练成本随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外微调阶段来支持更多精度选项，训练负担较重。

Method: 1. 权重偏差校正：通过中和不同位宽间的量化诱导偏差和对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化，无需微调；2. 位级核心集采样策略：利用梯度重要性分数为每个子模型选择紧凑且信息丰富的训练子集，利用隐式知识转移现象。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。

Conclusion: EMQNet方法有效解决了多比特量化网络训练开销大的问题，通过创新的技术手段实现了训练效率的显著提升，同时不牺牲模型效用。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

TL;DR: MixKV提出了一种结合重要性和多样性的KV缓存压缩方法，针对多模态大语言模型中注意力头间语义冗余模式，显著提升压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中模态特定的语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV通过分析注意力头间的语义冗余差异，自适应地平衡重要性和多样性来选择保留的KV对，实现优化的缓存压缩。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV在五个多模态理解基准上平均提升基线方法5.1%，在GUI定位任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别提升8.0%和9.0%，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV有效解决了多模态大语言模型中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，该方法也可无缝扩展到纯语言模型中并获得可比性能提升。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是首个通用、传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损范围图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点数损失和完全几何精度保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用的需求。

Method: 通过自动反向工程推断旋转LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保存，所有点云中零点数丢失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变为需要完全几何保真的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和帧间插值，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的挑战，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在高分辨率图像生成时面临二次计算复杂度问题，训练成本极高

Method: 利用扩散过程的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现最先进的超高清图像生成性能，如使用FLUX生成1600万像素图像

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效的无训练方法，显著扩展了预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: MeanFlow作为few-step生成模型框架虽然强大，但其优化过程中存在轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性目标之间的负相关冲突，导致收敛缓慢，需要更好的优化策略。

Method: 提出了α-Flow统一框架，通过课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，解决了目标冲突问题。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow，α-Flow-XL/2+模型取得了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow成功解决了MeanFlow的优化冲突问题，为few-step生成模型提供了更有效的训练框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Conclusion: Cupid通过将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，在共享3D潜空间中统一表示相机姿态和3D形状，实现了卓越的重建性能

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖离散表示或语义提示输入任务特定解码器的局限性，这些方法限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，使分割完全依赖于MLLM的像素级理解；采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以降低推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过生成式方法成功实现了统一的多模态理解和像素级感知，为图像分割提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Result: 与现有潜在空间方法相比，该方法将物理准确预测的时间范围显著延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持相当性能。通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过简单、参数高效且可解释的方法进行基于注意力的视频时空建模提供了一个平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型相结合，解决信息密集型图像中密集文本和图形元素的多模态推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时表现不佳，这些图像密集交织着文本注释和细粒度图形元素，主要挑战在于精确定位关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，包含草稿阶段和裁决阶段：草稿阶段使用小型VLMs生成多样化的定位候选推理路径；裁决阶段使用强VLM合成这些路径产生最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制只转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准上取得一致性能提升，相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现了错误校正和成本效率。

Conclusion: SV框架通过合成多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，实现了错误校正和成本效率的平衡，为信息密集型图像的多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一种物理引导的自监督高光谱-多光谱图像融合框架，通过解混瓶颈实现可解释的高光谱超分辨率重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低导致边界模糊和混合像素效应，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且在MSI波段较少时性能下降

Method: 从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，通过多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，采用线性混合模型重建光谱，通过MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的非监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法竞争力相当

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供可解释的中间结果，训练时间短（不到1分钟），即使在单波段MSI情况下也保持鲁棒性

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在单模态生成方面表现出色，但跨模态转换仍面临挑战，现有方法依赖限制性假设（如共享维度、高斯先验等），限制了通用性和理论基础

Method: 基于潜变量扩展的Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models，在共享潜空间学习任意模态间的桥梁，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构，并提出预测损失指导训练

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线，支持任意模态对的翻译任务

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现多主体个性化图像生成，解决了现有方法缺乏空间组合控制和多主体扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且在多个主体场景下扩展性不佳，无法有效处理多主体遮挡和身份保持问题。

Method: 引入分层画布表示（每个主体位于独立层实现无遮挡组合）和锁定机制（保持选定层高保真度，其余层灵活适应上下文），无需架构修改，利用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优于现有技术的空间控制和身份保持效果。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的分层操作提供了类似专业图像编辑软件的用户体验，有效解决了多主体生成中的空间控制和身份保持挑战。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯、多镜头叙事方面的不足，填补"叙事鸿沟"，实现真正的故事讲述能力。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集但镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM和RAG技术在艺术史和数字人文研究中的巨大潜力，能够有效提升大规模视觉档案分析的准确性

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的图像去雾方法计算成本高、参数量大，不适合资源受限设备，需要更轻量、透明的替代方案。

Method: 结合物理模型（改进的暗通道先验）和绿色学习框架，采用U形架构进行无监督特征提取，使用RFT和LNT等特征工程技术保持模型紧凑，最后通过透明监督学习获得去雾图像。

Result: GUSL-Dehaze显著减少了参数数量，同时保持数学可解释性，性能与最先进的深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像去雾任务提供了绿色、轻量、透明的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，现有方法在处理这类数据时存在局限性。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构建随机特征，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算不可约分量，通过特征谱分析实现分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺科学领域取得最先进突破。

Conclusion: FINDER在特定条件下优于现有方法，但也存在失败模式和局限性，需要进一步讨论适用范围。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，通过分离原型和编码器的优化目标来消除原型收敛到相似表示的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的原型自监督学习方法普遍存在原型部分崩溃问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标指导编码器学习丰富表示的核心目的。现有方法通常通过过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化器来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下分别学习。具体地，将原型建模为高斯混合模型，采用在线EM风格的过程独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦方法无需显式正则化即可消除原型崩溃，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的原型自监督学习框架。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 随着生成模型和AI生成内容的激增，水印技术对确保内容真实性和归属至关重要。然而，当前研究主要关注水印的鲁棒性，而对水印伪造（即从真实内容中窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）的研究较少。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and

Conclusion: 结合梯度分析和选择性剪枝，可在无需微调的情况下快速适配LLM到新数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的循环变换器模型通过隐式记忆机制解决了长期依赖问题，为机器人连续空间感知和导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

TL;DR: Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP) 是一个结合视觉基础模型和扩散规划的领域无关自动驾驶停车系统，在分布偏移下实现了90%以上的停车成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶方法在领域偏移（如天气和光照变化）下的鲁棒性仍然是一个关键挑战，需要不依赖额外数据的解决方案。

Method: 集成视觉基础模型与基于扩散的规划，在CARLA中训练并在对抗性设置下进行零样本迁移，使用3D高斯泼溅环境进行真实世界测试。

Result: 在所有测试的分布外场景中停车成功率超过90%，消融研究证实网络结构和算法设计显著提升了跨领域性能。

Conclusion: DDP展示了有前景的模拟到真实世界迁移能力，为自动驾驶停车提供了鲁棒的跨领域解决方案。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Motivation: 开发能够在不使用真实机器人的情况下，通过仿真实现机器人操作策略的可重复评估和sim2real策略训练的系统。

Method: 提出GSDF（高斯场景描述文件）格式，将高斯网格表示与机器人URDF和物体结合，构建包含3种机器人配置和40多个物体的数据库，并与物理引擎集成。

Conclusion: GSWorld提供了一个真实感强、功能丰富的机器人操作模拟平台，为sim2real研究提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

*Adam Diamant*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 开发AI姿态估计管道，精确量化阻力训练中的运动学特征，比较部分范围运动(pROM)和全范围运动(fROM)训练的差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用AI技术改进阻力训练研究，精确量化不同训练方式(pROM vs fROM)的运动学差异，为训练处方提供科学依据

Method: 使用Wolf等人(2025)的视频数据，处理280个记录，提取关节角度轨迹，通过滤波平滑处理后计算ROM、节奏、向心/离心阶段持续时间等指标，应用随机效应元分析模型

Result: pROM训练具有更小的运动范围和更短的持续时间(特别是离心阶段)，参与者个体差异是变异的主要来源，部分范围运动比例(%ROM)在不同练习中相对一致

Conclusion: 部分范围运动与全范围运动不仅在运动范围上存在差异，在执行动态和一致性方面也不同，AI方法有潜力推进阻力训练研究和改进训练处方

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
