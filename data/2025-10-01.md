### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一种基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：1）时域路径使用轻量级MoCLIP模型提供语义监督；2）频域路径从低频DCT分量提取语义信息。通过时间调制机制自适应融合两种对齐信号。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别获得0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了语义对齐问题，实现了高效、可扩展的高保真文本到动作生成。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专门测试视觉语言模型在密集场景中的基本视觉理解能力。测试显示当前最先进模型在复杂场景中表现不佳，揭示了现有基准测试可能高估了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试通常关注全局图像理解，但可能高估了VLMs的真实能力。作者认为编码和推理细节对于当前模型来说仍然具有挑战性，特别是在密集场景中。

Method: 创建VisualOverload数据集，包含高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像具有密集的人物、动作和复杂背景。手动标注了六个任务类别的问题，测试模型对场景的深入理解。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最佳模型（o3）在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了模型在计数、OCR和逻辑一致性方面的多种失败模式。

Conclusion: VisualOverload暴露了当前视觉模型的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。密集场景中的基本视觉理解仍然是当前模型的挑战。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的方法来编辑视频中的生理信号（如心率），同时保持视觉保真度，以解决相机心率监测带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于相机的心率监测虽然方便无接触，但会泄露敏感的个人健康信息，存在严重的隐私风险。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化进行融合，在解码器中应用特征线性调制和微调输出层来避免生理信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可控的心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的认知诊断基准，重点关注视角转换挑战，通过细粒度诊断类别分析模型的系统性弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在系统性缺陷，需要专门的诊断工具来评估其视角转换、相对位置理解等核心认知能力。

Method: 设计围绕视角转换的细粒度诊断类别，包括平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化，从简单单物体任务逐步过渡到复杂多物体视角转换场景，评估37个先进VLMs。

Result: 发现VLMs存在强烈的自我中心偏差、旋转理解能力差、对称和语法重构下的不一致性等问题。人类准确率达91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench揭示了VLMs在空间推理方面的关键差距，为理解其物理空间推理能力提供了重要见解，且基准的难度与人类认知挑战一致。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息。

Method: 设计联合时空注意力机制，统一处理多模态特征，实现深度多模态融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，长程预测RMSE比基线方法（包括STGCN和STAEformer）降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构本身具备深度多模态融合能力是实现突破性性能的关键。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs通过文本交互解决视觉任务，但在3D理解上表现不佳。DepthLM方法通过视觉提示和相机内参增强，使VLMs在深度估计任务上达到专家级精度，且无需复杂架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的VLMs在从2D输入理解3D方面存在困难，而专家视觉模型在度量深度估计等3D任务上表现优异但需要特定架构。研究探索VLMs能否在不改变架构或损失的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机内参条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。无需密集预测头或复杂回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使用更小的模型，在精度上超过最先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然避免了过度平滑问题，在边界区域飞点更少。

Conclusion: DepthLM的简单性使单个VLM能够覆盖度量深度以外的各种3D任务，证明了VLMs在3D理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度（SIC）的高分辨率制图和不确定性量化，通过融合多源卫星数据来解决海冰特征提取、模型不确定性和数据异质性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛北极海冰的高分辨率制图和可靠的不确定性量化对于海冰业务化制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征微妙、模型不确定性和数据异质性等关键挑战，这一任务十分困难。

Method: 设计了具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改善特征提取；提出了贝叶斯扩展的Transformer模型，将参数视为随机变量以更好地捕捉不确定性；在决策级融合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2三种不同数据源以解决数据异质性问题。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试表明，与其他不确定性量化方法相比，所提模型能够同时实现高分辨率SIC制图和稳健的不确定性制图。

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯Transformer方法有效解决了海冰制图中的关键挑战，为泛北极海冰监测提供了高精度和可靠的不确定性量化工具。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器的多传感器融合框架，通过卡尔曼滤波后期融合策略显著提高车辆轨迹跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，在复杂交通环境中实现精确的车辆检测和定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施感知和实时轨迹生成在提高高风险路段（如施工区）安全性方面具有潜力，但实际部署受到透视失真、复杂几何形状、遮挡和成本等因素的限制。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展、成本效益高的车辆检测和定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略来增强轨迹一致性和准确性。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低高达70%，同时保持横向精度在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹与真实车辆路径高度匹配，即使在单传感器数据间歇或退化时也能保持稳定。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合能够可靠地补偿单个传感器的局限性，为复杂交通环境中的主动安全措施提供精确且鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，为基础设施支持的多传感器系统部署提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的AI生成图像检测范式“先观察后推理”，通过Forensic-Chat模型和ExplainFake-Bench基准测试，解决了多模态大语言模型在检测伪造图像时存在的视觉感知不足和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在检测AI生成图像时表现不佳，主要原因是：1）视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低层次伪造痕迹不敏感；2）微调数据格式与预训练分布差异大，导致模型依赖语言捷径而忘记预训练知识。

Method: 提出“先观察后推理”新范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知能力。开发了Forensic-Chat模型（具有多轮对话能力的可泛化、可解释检测助手）和ExplainFake-Bench基准测试（从五个关键方面评估MLLMs的可解释性）。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在泛化能力和真实可靠的可解释性方面表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 通过增强MLLMs的视觉感知能力，使其能够基于实际观察进行推理，可以有效提升AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视频通话中伪造视频的视线模式来识别深伪内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意攻击者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于视频通话允许访问深伪视频所“看到”的内容，可以利用视线追踪来检测无法模仿真实人类微妙非语言交流的深伪视频

Method: 基于对双向对话中视线模式研究的可解释特征构建模型，利用恶意攻击者流媒体视频中的估计视线来检测深伪内容

Result: 在自建的新型数据集上测试，达到82%的准确率

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线追踪技术进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时深伪检测提供了新的生物特征信息维度

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6-DoF物体姿态估计算法，专门针对火星样本返回任务中的机器人臂在硬件受限条件下进行物体定位的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机器人臂在低间隙拾取和插入操作时对多个目标物体进行精确定位的挑战，特别是在硬件资源严重受限的环境下。

Method: 利用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅使用低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入实现鲁棒的姿态估计。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性，特别适用于资源受限的太空任务环境。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，导致自然语言指称（如"右边那辆黑车"）难以准确解析。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以确定指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法有显著提升，消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步提高接地性能。

Conclusion: 研究证明了VLM和LLM在零样本设置下的互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称接地。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VISOR++方法，通过优化视觉输入实现对多模态视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开放和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，激活向量方法需要侵入式运行时模型访问。需要一种跨模型通用且部署友好的行为控制方法。

Method: VISOR++通过生成优化的视觉输入来模拟目标激活模式，实现对模型行为的控制。该方法可以针对单个模型或模型集合进行优化，支持多种行为方向控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上验证了有效性，在拒绝、谄媚和生存本能三个行为方向上达到与激活向量相当的性能。VISOR++图像在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种非侵入式的通用行为控制方法，适用于开放和闭源模型，具有良好的部署兼容性和性能保持能力。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过基于任意图像对的竞争性视觉游戏实现自我训练，在推理、图表问答等任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RL方法对人工标注数据的高度依赖问题，降低训练成本，促进视觉语言模型的实际部署。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，通过"谁是卧底"式游戏让模型在多角色间进行战略推理；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法，结合自玩和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上超越了其他基于标注的方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注的自玩训练框架的有效性，为视觉语言模型的自主改进提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于注意力U-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣有恶变为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测对提高生存率至关重要。现有AI诊断方法在眼底彩色图像分割上面临数据质量差、标注不一致等挑战，需要开发更精确、数据需求更少的诊断工具。

Method: 提出混合模型，将数学/聚类分割方法与U-Net的优势相结合，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖，同时提高分割精度。

Result: 在1024*1024高分辨率眼底图像上，混合模型达到89.7% Dice系数和80.01% IoU，明显优于注意力U-Net的51.3%和34.2%，并在外部数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统开发提供了有效基础，有望应用于自动化病灶标注，提升诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for

Motivation: 虽然ViG在图像识别中表现出色，但现有的图卷积方法（如Max-Relative、EdgeConv等）缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系且无需架构特定优化的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居。设计了AttentionViG架构，使用该聚合方案进行非局部消息传递。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在计算量相当的情况下提供了与现有视觉GNN架构竞争性的精度。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，现有少样本学习方法主要针对标准设定，而实际医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已有知识，这种广义少样本分类研究较少

Method: 构建包含479,215张胸部X光片的MetaChest数据集，设计标准少样本分类元集划分和多标签episode生成算法，评估迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法

Conclusion: MetaChest数据集为医学图像少样本学习提供重要基准，迁移学习方法在医学少样本多标签分类中表现出色，高效模型架构具有实际应用价值

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识（解剖先验、参考案例推理、实时交互）的灵活性形成鲜明对比。

Method: 提出双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过Mixture-of-Experts解码器动态路由，支持三种知识范式的灵活切换和联合训练。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，通过统一框架整合异构知识源，为医学图像分割提供了更接近实际临床需求的方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于锚框的跨视角物体地理定位方法受限于预定义锚框，为了消除这种依赖，作者提出了无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实框的四个方向偏移量，结合高斯位置编码建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并采用跨视角物体关联模块来关联不同视角下的相同物体及其周围环境。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式结合GPE和CVOAM，在跨视角物体地理定位任务中取得了优异效果，且参数开销最小。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Result: 在VISTA、CLIP、TinyCLIP等模型上，使用M-BEIR、MMEB、CoVR基准测试均显示性能提升

Conclusion: GCL是一种有效的多模态检索方法，能够在不增加数据负担的情况下提升模型性能

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，结合ConSinGAN数据增强技术解决金属板材图像不足问题，YOLOv9模型表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms，已集成到实际AOI系统中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工缺陷检测耗时耗力的问题，特别是金属板材表面和孔洞缺陷检测面临的图像数据不足挑战。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板材图像进行数据增强，比较YOLOv3、v4、v7、v9四个版本模型，最终选择YOLOv9与ConSinGAN结合的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了金属板材缺陷检测中的数据不足问题，建立的AOI系统具有实用价值，且易于推广到其他工业制造组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出OmniDFA框架，通过开放集、少样本源识别方法解决AI生成图像检测和溯源问题，构建大规模数据集OmniFake支持研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成图像检测方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，而溯源方法受限于缺乏大规模分类数据集，难以在实际中应用。

Method: 提出开放集、少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架实现图像真实性评估和合成源识别，构建包含117万张图像、45个生成模型的OmniFake数据集。

Result: 实验显示OmniDFA在开放集溯源方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和溯源提供了实用解决方案，数据集和代码将公开促进相关研究。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一种主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过三个协同组件解决现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但经验分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个组件：(1)上下文增强注意力图生成(CAG)缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；(2)主动视觉探测(AVP)基于信息理论主动选择最有助于回答问题的图像区域；(3)动态注意力转移触发(DAT)通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了扩散模型记忆训练数据的内在机制，发现早期去噪过程中的过度估计是导致记忆现象的核心原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然成功生成图像，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。先前研究主要关注检测和缓解记忆现象，但其根本原因和机制尚未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究训练样本在早期去噪阶段的过度估计如何导致记忆现象。

Result: 发现记忆现象不能仅用过拟合解释，而是由早期去噪中的过度估计驱动，这减少了多样性，使去噪轨迹收敛到记忆图像。无分类器引导会放大预测并诱导过度估计。

Conclusion: 早期过度估计是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，这为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来处理医学信息的多对多映射关系，在跨模态检索和分类任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医学信息的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，通过Hellinger距离的InfoNCE损失整合模态间分布，并引入概率合成采样损失来改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类方面优于现有Med-VLPMs，并实现了多模态的稳健整合。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率嵌入空间有效解决了医学多模态信息的多对多映射问题，提升了医学诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是首个通过Plackett-Luce模型在多模态DPO中整合多个语义多样负样本的框架，解决了现有方法依赖简化成对比较导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负样本，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器发现可解释因素中的语义偏差。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略提高训练效率。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在提升多模态对齐方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 验证了语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模，在视觉地点识别任务中取得了显著性能提升，仅使用4096D全局描述符即可实现优异结果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，特别是当地标条件与源图像差异较大时，传统方法将地标视为刚性几何约束会导致身份退化。

Method: 提出LaTo模型，包含三个关键创新：地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；位置映射位置编码集成面部和图像标记；地标预测器利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在实验中，LaTo在身份保持方面比现有最优方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标处理方法实现了更精确的人脸编辑控制，同时更好地保持了身份信息，并构建了HFL-150K数据集来解决数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects

real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term

remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final

Conclusion: 所提出的SO(3)扩散模型框架能够有效建模符合2D观察的准确姿态概率分布，为单目3D人体姿态恢复提供了更好的概率性解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Conclusion: GeoDrag方法能够实现连贯、高保真和结构一致的图像编辑，解决了传统拖拽方法在几何密集型场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: IPDRecon提出了一种基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建方法，通过减少对多视图几何约束的依赖，利用单视图内的丰富空间信息，显著提升了在视图受限场景下的重建稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视图像素反投影射线交点的弱几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: IPDRecon框架包含三个核心组件：像素级置信编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中编码的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅为0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中的视图受限场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了重建的视图不变性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效保持非试穿区域的身份和背景，消除边界伪影，提升视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿方法在保持非试穿区域（如身份和背景）方面存在挑战，常见的后处理策略直接替换原始内容会导致边界伪影和语义漂移问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器逐步增强测量一致性；提出基于残差先验的初始化方法减少训练-推理不匹配，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪的无伪影测量引导采样。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架解决了虚拟试穿中的非试穿区域保持问题，实现了更好的身份背景保持和伪影消除效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [41] [Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Preference Image Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25771)
*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Text Preference Optimization (TPO)框架，无需配对图像偏好数据即可实现文本到图像模型的对齐优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本-图像对齐方面仍存在挑战，传统RLHF方法依赖成本高昂的人工标注数据，存在可扩展性限制

Method: 通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来实现对齐，使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TPO方法在人类偏好评分和文本-图像对齐方面均优于原始方法

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了'免费午餐'式的对齐优化，无需配对图像偏好数据，具有更好的可扩展性

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了v-HUB基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉幽默理解能力，发现模型在仅依赖视觉线索时理解幽默存在困难，而音频的加入能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，以增强人机交互中的参与度。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准测试，包含精选的无声短视频，配以丰富的注释，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并进一步构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs在仅依赖视觉线索理解幽默时表现显著下降，而加入音频后性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 音频对视频幽默理解有帮助，强调了声音信息的重要性，以及整合更丰富模态对于复杂视频理解任务的潜力。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PCPO框架，通过比例信用分配解决T2I模型强化学习训练中的不稳定问题，显著提升收敛速度和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量。分析发现主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的信用分配不均衡。

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化（PCPO）框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重新加权来强制实施比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，实现了更快的收敛速度和更优的图像质量，在所有方面都大幅优于现有策略梯度基线，包括最先进的DanceGRPO。

Conclusion: 通过纠正信用分配不均衡问题，PCPO有效缓解了模型崩溃这一递归训练中的常见故障模式，为T2I模型的强化学习对齐提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了ENM Inversion方法，解决文本引导图像编辑中噪声映射的编辑性问题，实现更好的内容保持和编辑保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在图像编辑中存在限制，因为反演的噪声映射虽然能忠实重建源图像，但缺乏编辑灵活性，难以准确遵循目标文本提示

Method: ENM Inversion通过搜索最优噪声映射来确保内容保持和可编辑性，分析噪声映射特性，引入可编辑噪声细化来最小化重建和编辑噪声映射之间的差异

Result: 实验表明ENM Inversion在图像编辑任务中在保持度和编辑保真度方面优于现有方法，并能应用于视频编辑实现时间一致性和跨帧内容操作

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了文本引导图像编辑中的编辑性问题，为扩散模型在图像和视频编辑中的应用提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一种无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则和多数投票机制生成伪标签，使用GRPO方法迭代提升视觉语言模型在图像质量评估任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖于昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出EvoQuality框架，将自我一致性原则应用于基于排名的IQA任务，通过成对多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用GRPO进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明EvoQuality将基础VLM的零样本性能在PLCC指标上提升了31.8%，在7个IQA基准测试中有5个超越了最先进的监督VLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了完全自监督的方法在图像质量评估任务中可以达到甚至超越监督方法的性能，为VLM在感知任务中的自监督优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出EchoingECG模型，通过概率学生-教师框架将超声心动图知识蒸馏到心电图中，提升心电图对心脏功能的预测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图成本低且易获取，而超声心动图需要更多医院资源但临床价值高。希望通过心电图预测传统上需要超声心动图才能获得的测量指标

Method: 结合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP视觉语言预训练模型，构建不确定性感知的心电图嵌入，通过超声心动图监督进行知识蒸馏

Result: 在零样本、少样本和微调设置下，EchoingECG在基于心电图的超声心动图预测任务上优于最先进的心电图基础模型

Conclusion: 方差估计增强了模型性能的理解，能够识别心电图中的不确定性区域，为心电图作为更易获取的心脏功能评估工具提供了新途径

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统性评估。

Method: 设计PIO基准测试，包含三个层次：S1（参考对象定位）、S2（任务驱动指向）、S3（视觉轨迹预测），数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的测试显示，GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO等模型在S1和S2表现良好，但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准测试能有效评估VLMs的具身推理能力，揭示了不同模型在精确视觉定位任务上的差异性表现，为模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种动态相似性图适配模块（DSGA），结合LoRA技术，在极少量数据条件下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业场景中细小密集物体的精确分割，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战，需要开发能够在极端数据约束下保持高性能的适配方法。

Method: 提出DSGA模块，通过动态相似性图构建（使用可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制）和自适应局部特征聚合，结合LoRA技术，构建互补优化框架，仅需4.00M可训练参数（原SAM的4.26%）。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，相比基线SAM微调，Structure-measure提升17.31%，自适应F-measure提升62.36%，在10-120个豆荚的复杂田间图像中实现准确计数（调整R方0.8987）。

Conclusion: 该方法在极少量数据条件下实现了高效的SAM模型适配，为自动化农业监测应用提供了实用解决方案，通过Grad-CAM和t-SNE验证了特征判别有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过新的领域特定多模态推理范式，有效解决了商标识别中的泛化问题，为产品审核等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

### [52] [Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845)
*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励引导方法主要关注图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中如何平衡奖励最大化和源图像保真度仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种编辑任务中显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线方法，实现了奖励最大化和源图像保真度的更好平衡，且避免了奖励作弊。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案，在保持图像内容的同时成功实现了目标奖励的优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 多模态推理虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会导致视觉遗忘现象，即模型逐渐忽视视觉输入。作者提出VAPO方法来解决这一问题，并在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多模态推理在提升复杂任务表现的同时，可能会损害模型的感知基础能力，导致对基本视觉问题的识别失败。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础的轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，为视觉语言模型的可靠推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个多模态符号逻辑推理基准MuSLR，评估了当前视觉语言模型在形式逻辑推理方面的能力，并提出了LogiCAM框架来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，需要严格的确定性推理来防止严重后果。当前缺乏专门的基准来评估视觉语言模型的这种能力。

Method: 提出了MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域的35种原子符号逻辑和976种逻辑组合。同时提出了LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估了7个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现它们在多模态符号推理方面表现不佳，最好的GPT-4.1模型仅达到46.8%。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升了14.13%。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不一致。LogiCAM框架为未来改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

TL;DR: 提出统一的PatchEAD框架，通过视觉提示技术实现无需训练的异常检测，兼容多种基础模型，在少样本和零样本场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测研究主要关注文本提示调优，而视觉处理部分缺乏统一框架，针对不同基础模型需要特定处理步骤，限制了实际部署效率。

Method: 提出Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD)框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，专注于图像块相似性分析，无需训练即可适配多种基础模型。

Result: 实验显示PatchEAD在少样本和批量零样本检测中优于现有方法，即使不使用文本特征也能取得优异性能，同时分析了不同基础模型结构对检测鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的纯图像块框架能够实现快速、轻量级部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际工业视觉检测提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，实现了实时性能和可靠的低光照色彩化，成功恢复原本不可检测的场景细节

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成360度彩色点云，在低光照条件下表现优异，简化了系统设置流程

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉组织学实体的亚型特异性表型变异（如细胞核、腺体），这些变异对癌症诊断至关重要。

Method: 1. 利用大语言模型生成实体级和切片级提示；2. 提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块进行实体级特征对齐；3. 开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；4. 结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的实验结果表明，该方法在少样本病理诊断任务中具有有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过多尺度视觉语义的层次整合，显著提升了少样本WSI分类的性能，为癌症诊断提供了更精细的分析能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Motivation: 当前"图像思考"范式在VLMs中存在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的探索空间，需要推进多模态推理的发展。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思考"的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的灵活"图像思考"方法，为多模态推理提供了有效解决方案，展示了该范式的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的坐标数值。

Method: 提出了一种即插即用框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，通过两阶段训练策略实现精确定位而不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了一个有效且灵活的模式，用于构建具有感知能力的视觉语言模型，弥合了高层推理和细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了36种最先进的视觉模型，发现对抗鲁棒性遵循对数缩放定律：数据量增加10倍，攻击成功率平均降低3.2%；模型规模增加10倍，攻击成功率平均降低13.4%。数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对鲁棒性影响更大。

Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响不同视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36种最先进的视觉模型，包括监督学习、自监督学习和对比学习方法，训练数据规模从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 发现对抗鲁棒性遵循对数缩放定律，但某些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）表现优于在更大但质量较低数据集上训练的模型。对抗性微调能改善结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力无改善。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

TL;DR: UniMMAD是一个统一的多模态多类异常检测框架，通过混合专家驱动的特征解压缩机制实现自适应和分离的重建，在9个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化、内存开销大，且基于重建的多类方法依赖共享解码路径，难以处理跨域的大变化，造成正态边界扭曲、域干扰和高误报率。

Method: UniMMAD采用混合专家驱动的特征解压缩机制，编码阶段将多模态输入压缩为通用特征，解码阶段通过稀疏门控交叉MoE将通用特征解压缩为模态特定和类别特定的形式，设计了分组动态过滤机制和MoE-in-MoE结构以减少参数使用。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态多类异常检测中的碎片化和效率问题，证明了其在跨领域应用中的有效性和高效性。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: SS-ACL是一种无需专家标注的自监督解剖一致性学习框架，通过文本提示和分层解剖图实现医学报告的视觉基础生成，在准确性和临床效能上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学报告生成方法依赖独立训练的检测模块、需要大量专家标注、标注成本高且因病理分布偏差导致泛化性差的问题。

Method: 提出自监督解剖一致性学习(SS-ACL)，构建分层解剖图模拟人体解剖的包含结构，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，并引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: SS-ACL在无需专家标注的情况下，在词汇准确性上优于最先进方法10%，临床效能提升25%，在零样本视觉基础任务上超越当前领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架能够生成准确且视觉基础化的医学报告，为临床工作流程提供可解释的视觉证据，在多个下游视觉任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Motivation: 现有的交互式分割方法主要局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在处理稀疏的真实世界扫描时表现不佳，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了一个新的3D数据合成流水线来创建大规模、场景级数据集，并提出PinPoint3D交互框架，利用少量用户点点击进行细粒度分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下，每个对象部件的平均IoU达到约55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有最优方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更精细和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设缺乏充分理论依据，且Partial2Global的随机采样策略导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响全局排序质量

Method: 使用折刀式共形预测构建可靠替代集，结合覆盖设计采样方法确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖

Result: 大量实验表明RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现优异，优于Partial2Global方法

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过可靠替代集和覆盖设计采样，实现了更可靠和全面的视觉上下文学习示例选择

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的视频编辑模型在处理长时长和高分辨率视频时，由于传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度限制，难以适应实时视频处理等实际应用场景。

Method: 将RWKV变压器的双向加权键值循环机制集成到基于扩散的视频编辑模型中，构建线性时空聚合模块，在保持时间连贯性的同时捕获全局依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，速度提升高达3.7倍，内存使用降低60%，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在长视频编辑中表现出显著优势，随着视频序列长度增加，与传统自注意力架构的编辑速度差距更加明显，为实时视频处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Conclusion: 自然语言描述可作为有效的弱监督信号，显著降低手部物体分割任务的标注成本，推动相关应用发展

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: AgenticIQA是一个模块化代理框架，通过整合视觉语言模型和传统IQA工具，以动态、查询感知的方式解决图像质量评估问题，在评分准确性和解释对齐方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法依赖固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应多样化失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分和解释通常作为独立过程处理，忽略了它们之间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 提出AgenticIQA框架，将IQA分解为四个子任务：失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调完成。规划器制定任务特定策略，执行器通过工具调用收集感知证据，总结器整合证据生成准确分数和人类对齐的解释。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面一致优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，展示了基于VLM的IQA代理在规划和执行能力方面的优势，并为该领域提供了首个评估基准。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。针孔图像无畸变但视场小，鱼眼图像有畸变但视场大，两者结合可以互补优势。

Method: 1) 将2D特征显式提升到规范3D体积空间；2) 设计异构空间融合模块处理扭曲感知的体积特征；3) 将传统体素融合重新表述为3D高斯表示，使用可学习的高斯球动态适应局部纹理；4) 将融合的体积特征渲染为多视角深度图。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上达到了最先进的性能，超越了当前主流深度网络。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时会在去噪早期引入块状伪影，需要开发更高阶的模型来解决这个问题。

Method: 构建四阶非线性PDE模型，扩散过程由拉普拉斯算子和强度值共同指导，波动部分保持细节和纹理。模型可扩展到彩色图像处理。

Result: 使用PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标评估，在所有情况下都比现有模型产生更好的结果，在灰度图像和彩色图像上都表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶PDE模型在噪声抑制和细节保留方面优于传统的二阶各向异性扩散方法，适用于各种图像类型。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略和语义重排序来解决零样本组合图像检索中的背景干扰和细粒度语义匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法存在两个核心问题：基于联合的特征融合会携带无关背景细节稀释修改意图，以及全局余弦相似度缺乏解析细粒度语义关系的能力。

Method: SETR采用两阶段检索：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；细粒度重排序阶段使用预训练多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升高达15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为鲁棒且可移植的ZS-CIR建立了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据与OSM数据之间存在模态差距（数据结构、内容和空间粒度差异），现有遥感基础模型主要关注图像数据，缺乏有效的地理上下文整合。

Method: GeoLink利用OSM数据在预训练阶段提供多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互，并引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入。在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Motivation: 预训练视频生成模型在视频超分辨率方面潜力巨大，但现有方法采用全尺寸处理存在计算量大和输出分辨率固定的局限性。

Method: 提出PatchVSR方法，通过双流适配器进行条件引导，包括提取输入块特征的分支和提取全局上下文特征的分支，并注入位置信息以更好地在全局视频帧中定位块合成。

Conclusion: 基于分块的范式具有灵活性，能够以极高效率实现具有竞争力的4K视频超分辨率。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成软因果掩码，对输入图像注入空间变化的高斯噪声（背景区域强扰动，前景区域弱扰动）

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上取得优于现有OOD基线的一致性能提升

Conclusion: 因果扰动是实现可靠且可解释泛化的有效工具

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

### [78] [SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036)
*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge是一种轻量级方法，通过语义模态桥直接解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，将图像映射到文本模态并保持语义内容不变，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现优异，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于持续的模态间隙和仅关注模态间训练目标导致的，使得直接图像间比较不可靠。

Method: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法采用闭式解，可选通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2和4样本）下表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMMER模型的扩展，通过分割引导评分(SGS)管道处理全局场景不一致性，特别是前景-背景不匹配问题，无需重新训练即可提升多模态操纵检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现出色，但在处理全局场景不一致性（如前景背景不匹配）时存在局限，这源于标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐问题。

Method: 提出轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合。

Result: SGS仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略，显著提高了对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和token级解释能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理复杂场景不一致性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [80] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试多模态模型在全局和局部推理方面的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的快速发展使得制作可信的多模态虚假信息变得容易，但现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸替换、属性编辑和字幕更改），缺乏对全局不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配）的覆盖，而这类问题在现实世界的伪造内容中越来越普遍。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示词生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下。字幕在三种条件下生成：字面意义、文本属性和文本分割，产生三种新的操作类别：FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS。通过质量控制管道确保图像质量。

Result: 创建了包含5000个高质量样本的DGM4+数据集，涵盖了前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作的混合类型，为多模态模型检测提供了更全面的基准测试资源。

Conclusion: 通过引入全局操作，DGM4+扩展了现有数据集，创建了一个能够测试检测器在局部和全局推理方面能力的基准，有助于加强对多模态模型（如HAMMER）的评估，这些模型目前在前景-背景不一致性方面存在困难。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面理论的几何学习方法，用于处理计算机视觉和医学应用中常见的对称性问题，避免传统数据增强方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数计算机视觉和医学数据集都存在对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法依赖数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法效率较低且不够可持续。作者希望开发一种更直接、更几何化的方法来处理对称性问题。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来模除对称性，通过几何框架直接在对象空间上定义简单度量来衡量对称群作用下轨道之间的差异。特别提出了一个包含常速参数化在内的2参数曲线规范参数化族。

Result: 开发了可用于处理平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化等对称性的几何学习框架，并在物体轮廓数据集上进行了验证。提供了开源代码和教程笔记本。

Conclusion: 该方法为对称性处理提供了几何理论基础，避免了数据增强的局限性，具有广泛的应用前景。几何概念简单易懂，可推广到多种应用场景。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出利用基础模型生成3D伪标签，结合时序信息进行标签稠密化，显著提升语义占用预测性能，并设计了轻量级模型EasyOcc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法（如新视角合成、跨视图渲染等）计算成本高、内存占用大，且难以迁移到其他架构。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，并设计轻量级模型EasyOcc仅从伪标签学习。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型上mIoU提升45%（9.73→14.09）；EasyOcc达到13.86 mIoU；在全场景评估中EasyOcc达到7.71 mIoU，优于之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择对自监督学习的全面场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时多模态深度学习框架，能在足球点球中球接触前预测射门方向（左、中、右），准确率达89%，推理时间仅22毫秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判射门方向。

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN处理RGB帧的空间特征，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并引入注意力机制，使用距离阈值法分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上测试，准确率达89%，比仅使用视觉或姿态的基线方法提升14-22%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级可解释模型适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

TL;DR: Reason-3D是一个基于大型推理模型的文本到场景生成方法，通过物体检索和空间推理来解决复杂几何和物体变换的挑战，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和物体变换时表现不佳，对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱。

Method: Reason-3D整合了基于物理、功能和上下文属性的物体检索，根据隐式和显式布局约束放置物体，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资产检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff提出了一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理方法，通过优化条件熵来系统性地减少去噪过程中的不确定性，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理不一致的问题。现有梯度求解器如DPM-Solver缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，发现成功去噪的关键是减少反向转移的条件熵。基于此提出EVODiff方法，通过优化条件方差来最小化转移误差和重建误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重建误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78）；在ImageNet-256上，将高质量样本的NFE成本减少25%（从20降低到15）；同时改善了文本到图像生成并减少了伪影。

Conclusion: EVODiff通过信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论依据，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升了推理效率，优于现有最先进的梯度求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型的前馈式主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略解决现有方法在效率和质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的前馈架构，但推理速度慢。视觉自回归模型具有快速采样和强生成质量，但在此任务中未被充分探索。

Method: EchoGen采用双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题的高级语义身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入；内容编码器捕获精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成。这是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架。

Result: 定量和定性结果证实，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时显著降低采样延迟。

Conclusion: EchoGen成功地将主题驱动生成能力引入VAR模型，在保持高质量的同时大幅提升效率，为创意AI应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE（熵引导动态补丁编码器），一种基于信息论的时间序列动态分块方法，通过条件熵检测时间转折点来保持时间连贯性


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法使用时间无关的固定分块策略，破坏了时间连贯性和短期依赖关系

Method: 包含熵引导动态分块器（EDP）和自适应补丁编码器（APE）两个模块，前者用条件熵检测自然时间转折点确定分块边界，后者用池化和交叉注意力捕获块内依赖

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面均有提升

Conclusion: 熵引导动态分块为时间序列建模提供了一种有前景的新范式

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a

Result: 在17个最先进的MLLMs上进行了广泛实验，有效暴露了现有模型的局限性

Conclusion: Human-MME基准为指导未来MLLMs研究提供重要参考，推动更好的人类中心图像理解能力发展

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文首次对自动驾驶中行人检测的公平性进行了全面的姿态和遮挡感知评估，发现检测器对并行腿、直肘和侧向视图的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多检测模型致力于降低漏检率并处理遮挡和远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。本文旨在系统研究行人姿态变化（包括腿部状态、肘部状态和身体方向）以及单个关节遮挡如何影响检测性能。

Method: 在ECP-DP数据集上评估了五个行人专用检测器和三个通用模型，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现检测器对并行腿、直肘和侧向视图的行人存在偏见，下半身关节遮挡对检测率的负面影响比上半身和头部更大。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率，并在所有属性上表现出最小的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是自动驾驶中行人检测领域首次全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，为开发更公平的行人检测系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前细胞显微镜图像分析主要集中在细胞类型分类，而多属性分类研究相对不足，传统人工标注成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，使用PBC和WBCAtt两个互补数据集进行训练。

Result: 在细胞多属性分类任务上达到了94.62%的准确率，显著提升了模型可解释性，并大幅节省了时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen框架为计算机视觉分类任务建立了新的范式，能够有效自动化多属性标签的扩展，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data

showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码和解码成本。

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用于不同蒸馏流程且高度可扩展的方法，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了数据集蒸馏性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGCE框架解决广义类别发现中的多粒度概念挖掘和未知类别数量估计问题，通过动态概念对比学习和多粒度专家协作学习实现更好的类别发现性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要限制：1）未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息；2）假设未标记数据的类别数量已知，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE框架包含两个模块：1）动态概念对比学习（DCCL），交替进行概念挖掘和双级表示学习；2）多粒度专家协作学习（MECL），引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在9个细粒度视觉识别基准测试中达到最先进结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使不知道类别数量，MGCE也比需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标记数据中的类别数量，适用于实际的开放世界场景，在广义类别发现任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Motivation: 解决扩散生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法存在数据限制或图像质量受损的问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征进行重新生成，并制定可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的评估显示IMG优于现有对齐方法，并能作为即插即用适配器增强现有方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，无需额外数据或编辑操作即可提升对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Result: 提出的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强性能的同时，显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将模型压缩重新定义为电路发现，桥接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有Latent Action Models存在两个瓶颈：1)端到端训练的图像编码器空间理解能力差；2)输入帧距离较远时模型脆弱，时间感知有限。这些问题阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 1) Farsighted-LAM：具有几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模的潜在动作框架；2) SSM-VLA：基于Farsighted-LAM的端到端VLA框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块进行显式推理。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界设置的多个VLA任务中验证了SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理相结合的策略有效增强了具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 研究强调了将多模态推理基于视觉证据的重要性，可实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)方法，用于改善低比特后训练量化(PTQ)的精度损失问题，通过聚类特定的参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出，显著提升了低比特PTQ的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的后训练量化(PTQ)在低比特量化(如2-bit)下容易出现精度大幅下降，而普通的仿射变换方法在这种情况下反而会恶化结果。需要一种更精细的方法来减少量化误差。

Method: 提出Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT)框架，使用聚类特定的参数来对齐低比特量化输出与全精度输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需微调模型或量化参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，在W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18%的Top-1准确率，且作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT方法有效解决了低比特PTQ的精度损失问题，提供了一种轻量级且高效的误差减少方案，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected

generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点标注的旋转目标检测方法存在伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题，需要一种更有效的弱监督学习框架来替代昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在训练过程的不同阶段动态估计实例大小，实现标签分配方法的应用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合Voronoi分水岭算法和SAM模型的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能达到优秀性能，为弱监督旋转目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Conclusion: Flower成功地将流模型应用于逆问题求解，通过理论分析证明了其近似贝叶斯后验采样的能力，并在实践中展示了优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

### [104] [Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26325)
*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种连续时空视频超分辨率的新方法，使用3D视频傅里叶场（VFF）表示视频，实现了空间和时间维度的联合建模，在多个基准测试中达到了新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频表示分解为空间和时间组件，并依赖脆弱的显式帧变形进行运动补偿，这种方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发一种更鲁棒、统一的视频表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空一致的3D视频傅里叶场（VFF），使用神经网络编码器预测傅里叶基系数，支持任意时空位置的灵活采样，并包含高斯点扩散函数以确保无混叠重建。

Result: 在广泛的超分辨率因子范围内，该方法比现有基线提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时在计算上更高效，在多个基准测试中达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 3D视频傅里叶场表示通过联合建模空间和时间维度，显著改善了视频超分辨率的质量和效率，为连续时空视频处理提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本组合图像检索中准确捕捉用户意图的挑战，避免任务特定训练或标注数据的需求。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，展示了在零样本组合图像检索中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人类偏好数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型在自然语言指令编辑方面落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了包含20万+偏好对的大规模人类偏好数据集，训练\mname奖励模型，用于评估和选择高质量的图像编辑训练数据。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，显著优于VLM-as-judge模型，并能有效提升图像编辑模型的训练效果。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够有效扩展高质量训练数据，有望推动开源图像编辑模型的发展，具有强化学习后训练等应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ToTG（任务导向时序定位）新问题，旨在根据任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并开发TimeScope框架通过渐进推理解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理长视频时泛化能力有限，难以准确识别关键时刻，因此需要新的解决方案来应对任务导向的时序定位挑战。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：先识别粗粒度时间范围，再通过细粒度时刻划分进行精炼，并使用ToTG Pile数据集增强模型能力。

Result: 实验表明TimeScope在多种设置下均优于现有时序定位方法和主流MLLMs，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope框架成功解决了ToTG这一新挑战性问题，为长视频关键时刻定位提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专门为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过令牌熵和双级缩放机制显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖于频繁部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。

Method: 引入令牌熵作为视觉令牌生成的新信号，采用双级缩放机制：配置文件级融合内在和条件信号生成校准置信状态，策略级利用该状态自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型性能提升12.5%（GenEval）和15.2%（TIIF-Bench），视觉令牌消耗减少62.0%，在挑战性场景中性能下降缓解26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功解决了自回归图像生成中的测试时缩放挑战，证明了令牌熵和双级缩放机制的有效性，为高质量高效图像生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA是一个基于MLLMs的智能AI工程师系统，旨在实现无需训练数据或人工干预的通用视频异常检测，通过自适应场景感知策略规划、目标驱动启发式推理、工具增强自反思和自改进记忆链等能力，在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测面临复杂多样的现实场景挑战，传统方法依赖领域特定训练数据和手动调整，存在高劳动力成本和泛化能力有限的问题。因此需要开发能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型且无需训练数据或人工干预的通用VAD系统。

Method: 提出PANDA系统，包含四个核心能力：(1)自适应场景感知RAG机制检索异常相关知识进行策略规划；(2)潜在异常引导启发式提示策略增强推理精度；(3)渐进式反思机制和上下文感知工具集迭代优化决策；(4)记忆链机制利用历史经验持续改进性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中无需训练和人工干预即可实现最先进的性能，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测的目标，通过智能代理系统设计解决了传统方法的局限性，为无监督异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

TL;DR: MotionRAG是一个检索增强框架，通过从参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实感，具有模块化设计和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在动态真实性方面仍面临挑战，主要因为难以准确建模涉及物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态的复杂运动。

Method: 提出检索增强框架MotionRAG，包含三个关键技术：基于检索的管道提取高级运动特征、上下文学习的运动适应方法、基于注意力的运动注入适配器。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个领域和基础模型上取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，且能通过更新检索数据库实现新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，且某些模型在困难图像上会产生伪影，这些在平均分数中无法体现。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标（高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数）来预测测试图像中不同模型会产生显著视觉差异的情况，并设计了一种评估方法将这些视觉差异反映在客观指标上。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分视觉结果不同但平均性能接近的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更全面的超分辨率模型评估框架，能够更好地反映模型在实际应用中的真实性能表现。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: PRISM提出了一种渐进式三阶段图像去雨框架，通过多尺度特征聚合和混合域建模实现细粒度恢复和全局一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要更有效的去雨方法

Method: 渐进式三阶段框架：粗提取网络（CENet）、频率融合网络（SFNet）和精炼网络（RNet），采用混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行多尺度特征聚合

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果，优于近期去雨方法

Conclusion: PRISM能够有效学习高频雨特征，同时保持结构细节和全局上下文，提高图像质量

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但计算需求高，现有8位量化效果良好但4位量化仍具挑战性，因为大步长会放大低幅值激活的舍入误差导致纹理丢失

Method: QuaRTZ结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，通过前导零抑制压缩到4位保留最低有效位，平衡异常值保留和LSB精度

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上FID达到6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法

Conclusion: QuaRTZ方法能有效解决4位量化中的纹理损失问题，理论推导和实验验证均证明其在不同激活分布下的通用性

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an

that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，无需姿态预计算或逐场景优化，能够实现几何感知、视角一致的风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要预计算姿态、逐场景优化以及难以保持几何一致性的问题，提出一个能够处理从单张图像到多视角集合的通用框架。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，包含两条路径：几何路径使用自注意力保持几何保真度，风格路径通过全局交叉注意力注入风格信息；引入基于体素的3D风格损失来对齐场景特征与风格统计量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，验证了全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失以及框架从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的Transformer架构和3D风格损失，成功实现了无需优化的3D风格迁移，在保持几何一致性的同时实现了优秀的风格化效果。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景分类中物体间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战，特别是在敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类）中需要隐私保护和可解释性

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的稳健范式，具有隐私保护和可解释性优势

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出轻量级CBAM-CNN模型用于槟榔叶病害识别，仅2.13M参数，在10,185张图像数据集上达到95.58%准确率，优于传统预训练CNN模型。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoGuide模型，通过扩散后验采样器从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图），解决了传统方法因路径规划过程的不可逆和不可微特性导致的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式逆求解器在从移动轨迹重建空间布局时面临挑战，因为路径规划过程是非可逆、非可微的函数，导致基于似然得分优化的不稳定性。

Method: 采用对比学习训练嵌入空间，使兼容的平面图和轨迹彼此接近，不匹配的配对远离；在该嵌入空间中重新定义更平滑的似然得分形式，作为真实似然得分的有效近似，从而引导去噪过程朝向后验分布。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CoGuide模型从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，且比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入空间中的替代似然得分形式，CoGuide有效解决了路径规划非可微性带来的优化问题，实现了更稳定和一致的空间布局重建。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性后训练流程，通过课程式监督微调和离线策略知识蒸馏，显著提升十亿参数级小模型在边缘设备上的性能，实现资源受限环境下的高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在边缘设备上部署存在计算资源消耗高的问题，而单纯预训练的小模型性能不足，需要一种高效的后训练方法来提升小模型在复杂任务上的表现。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏相结合的系统性后训练流程，专门针对Ascend边缘设备优化。

Result: 所得到的指令调优模型在十亿参数级模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下展现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用且高效的解决方案，有效解决了资源受限环境下的部署挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

*Jijun Xiang,Longliang Liu,Xuan Zhu,Xianqi Wang,Min Lin,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DEPTHOR++框架，通过系统分析真实dToF传感器噪声特性，从三方面提升深度补全的鲁棒性：模拟训练数据生成、无参数异常检测机制、以及针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想dToF输入和完美dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了校准误差和异常值，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1）基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2）无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3）针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集使用低成本dToF数据超越高端设备22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升深度补全性能，使低成本传感器超越高端设备，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Stable Cinemetrics（SCINE），一个针对专业视频生成的结构化评估框架，通过四个解耦的层次化分类法（场景设置、事件、灯光、摄像机）来评估视频生成模型的专业性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立针对专业电影制作控制的结构化评估体系。

Method: 构建了包含76个细粒度控制节点的分类法体系，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注），并训练了自动评估器。

Result: 研究发现即使最强的现有模型在事件和摄像机相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练的自动评估器在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型领域的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类法和结构化评估管道为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型来自动化或优化电子显微镜图像中连接组的手动校对工作流程，显著降低人工成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜图像中连接组的重建需要大量人工校对工作，这是扩展连接组学的瓶颈，尤其是在制作更大规模的重建或进行比较连接组学研究时

Method: 利用已有的人工校对生成的地面真实数据来训练机器学习模型，开发了两种应用：一是指导校对工作流程，二是自动合并分割片段来校对神经元

Result: 方法能够在获得指导校对工作流程90%价值的同时减少80%的成本；自动合并了20万个分割片段（相当于4年人工工作量），将连接组的连接完成率提高了1.3个百分点

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效自动化连接组校对工作，显著提高效率并降低成本，为大规模连接组学研究提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新焦点和模糊级别对已创建图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当出现主体失焦等不良模糊效果时缺乏灵活的调整手段，需要开发能够对已拍摄图像进行重新对焦的技术。

Method: 提出扩散变换器框架进行重新对焦学习，通过模拟管道生成大规模不同焦点平面和散景级别的图像对数据，并引入基于摄影原理的堆叠约束来增强训练，确保精确的景深操作。

Result: 实验证明DiffCamera能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的扩散变换器框架和物理约束训练方法，成功实现了对已创建图像的灵活景深调整，为摄影后期处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制能力，无法优先处理特定对象，会产生不必要的背景声音或关注错误对象，限制了在专业Foley工作流中的应用。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知的音频生成任务，提出SAGANet多模态生成模型，利用视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成，并创建Segmented Music Solos基准数据集。

Result: SAGANet在可控性、高保真Foley合成方面显著优于当前最先进方法，为分割感知Foley研究设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对象级分割映射实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频生成控制，为专业音频制作提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Motivation: 面部表情分类面临高维度和复杂性的挑战，需要更有效的特征提取和降维方法

Method: 融合VGG19深度特征与SIFT、ORB手工特征，使用K-means聚类和UMAP降维

Result: 在FER数据集上达到83.3%的分类准确率

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组件

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像具有完整视场但数据稀缺，现有方法存在零样本泛化能力差和球面畸变处理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出数据增强引擎从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据（607K对），并设计SphereViT利用球面坐标增强几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，AbsRel指标比最强零样本基线平均提升38%，甚至优于领域内方法。

Conclusion: DA²展示了卓越的零样本泛化能力和高效性，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中重建完整的人体网格、对齐的SMPL-X身体模型和高斯泼溅表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际场景应用。HART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HART预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建来恢复完整几何，并与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，然后使用对齐的网格初始化高斯泼溅进行渲染。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：衣物网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS降低15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可以作为实际场景中鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计实现对相似变换群的等变性，解决了传统方法依赖预对齐导致泛化性能差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用位姿和尺度线索而非推断内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会严重下降。

Method: 设计SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范特征、在相似不变几何上推理并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI和OmniObject3D上分别降低最小匹配距离17%和Chamfer距离14%；在更严格协议下仍优于竞争对手的偏置设置。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，建立了新的跨领域性能记录。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专注于第一人称视角数据，通过城市中心记录的多模态数据，利用测绘工具获得厘米级精度的姿态标注，以评估现有SLAM系统在极端场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM基准测试无法反映第一人称视角设备面临的挑战，如运动多样性、动态视觉内容、长时间会话中的传感器校准变化等，且缺乏足够准确的地面真值姿态。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多小时、多公里轨迹，配备多种传感器，并利用测绘工具获得厘米级精度的间接姿态标注，设计不同难度级别的测试轨道。

Result: 发现现有最先进的学术SLAM系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别了导致问题的关键组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在第一人称视角极端场景下的性能提供了重要工具，有助于深入分析和评估不成熟的方法。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种新的统一多模态模型方法，通过多模态上下文连接视觉语言模型和扩散模型，将生成推理能力与高质量视觉合成解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进训练策略：1）通过多模态上下文连接VLM和轻量扩散头；2）扩展到预训练扩散模型增强细节；3）引入低级图像编码器提升保真度并进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强基线匹配，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制整合到多模态扩散变换器中，显著提高了文本到图像生成模型在空间关系准确性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系（如'上方'或'右侧'）方面存在持续挑战，而随着架构演进提升图像质量，传统的位置控制技术已与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 提出Stitch方法，通过自动生成边界框，在生成过程中利用特定注意力头捕获必要信息来隔离和裁剪单个对象，然后将它们在指定边界框内生成并无缝拼接在一起。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上提升了218%，在PosEval上提升了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了最先进的结果，比之前模型提高了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需额外训练，实现了空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，证明了该方法在提升文本到图像生成空间关系准确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中性能优越但长度泛化能力有限，当应用超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题，利用内存状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留和新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善长度泛化，全局姿态估计比基线提升2倍，在6GB GPU内存下以20FPS处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了测试时训练视角在3D重建中的有效性，提供了一种训练自由的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Conclusion: 该系统成功解决了高精地图制作的成本和维护难题，为自动驾驶在动态环境中的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: dVLA是一个基于扩散的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过多模态思维链统一视觉感知、语言推理和机器人控制，在单一扩散目标下联合优化感知、语言理解和动作，实现了更强的跨模态推理能力和对新指令及物体的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统VLA模型中感知、语言和动作模块分离的问题，通过统一框架实现更强的跨模态协同和泛化能力。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，结合多模态思维链，使用前缀注意力掩码和KV缓存技术加速推理，在单一扩散目标下联合优化所有模块。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.4%的平均成功率，超过离散和连续动作策略；在真实Franka机器人上成功完成包括需要多步规划的箱内拣选任务在内的多样化任务。

Conclusion: 统一的扩散框架为实用高性能VLA机器人技术提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM规划器存在规划范式固定、缺乏动作序列约束和错误不可知三个局限，需要更全面的具身任务规划方法

Method: 引入状态依赖图显式建模动作前提条件和效果，采用错误自适应重规划策略，包括错误回溯诊断和自适应动作子树生成

Result: 实验表明SDA-PLANNER在成功率和目标完成度上持续优于基线，特别是在多样化错误条件下表现更佳

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应规划范式和错误感知机制有效提升了具身任务规划的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

*Jian Guo Pan,Lin Wang,Xia Cai*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化SEM图像分割框架PerovSegNet，用于精确识别钙钛矿薄膜中的碘化铅、钙钛矿相和缺陷区域，实现了87.25%的平均精度，比基准模型提升4.08%，同时减少模型大小和计算量约25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SEM图像分析主要依赖人工操作，限制了处理效率和一致性。钙钛矿太阳能电池制造中，碘化铅残留和钙钛矿晶粒形态对结晶路径、缺陷形成以及载流子传输和器件稳定性具有重要影响，需要自动化、精确的微观结构表征方法。

Method: 基于改进的YOLOv8x架构，提出PerovSegNet模型，包含两个新模块：(1)自适应洗牌扩张卷积块，通过分组卷积和通道混合增强多尺度和细粒度特征提取；(2)可分离自适应下采样模块，联合保留细尺度纹理和大尺度结构以实现更鲁棒的边界识别。模型在10,994张增强SEM图像上训练。

Result: PerovSegNet达到87.25%的平均精度，计算量为265.4 GFLOPs，比基准YOLOv8x-seg模型提升4.08%的精度，同时模型大小和计算负载分别减少24.43%和25.22%。

Conclusion: PerovSegNet提供了一个可扩展的工具，用于钙钛矿薄膜制造的实时过程监控和数据驱动优化，能够提供晶粒级定量指标，如碘化铅/钙钛矿面积和数量，作为结晶效率和微观结构质量的可靠指标。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

*Simon Welker,Lorenz Kuger,Tim Roith,Berthy Feng,Martin Burger,Timo Gerkmann,Henry Chapman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出并研究了一种新颖的盲逆问题——位置盲ptychography，即在没有任何扫描位置知识的情况下进行ptychographic相位恢复，需要同时恢复图像和位置信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该问题源于单粒子衍射X射线成像，其中随机方向的粒子被照射并收集一组衍射图案。如果使用高度聚焦的X射线束，测量结果也会对每个粒子的光束位置敏感，因此变成ptychographic，但这些位置也是未知的。

Method: 使用变分推理结合现代数据驱动的图像先验（基于分数的扩散模型），在模拟的简化2-D变体中进行图像重建可行性研究。

Result: 研究发现，在正确的照明结构和强先验条件下，即使在测量噪声下，也能在所有评估的成像场景中（除了最困难的情况）实现可靠和成功的图像重建。

Conclusion: 位置盲ptychography问题在适当的条件下是可行的，现代扩散模型先验可以有效支持这种复杂的联合重建任务。

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个结合机械偏微分方程和可微分深度学习的数学框架，用于模拟肿瘤形态的时空演变，同时考虑周围解剖结构的变化，以实现数字孪生框架中的解剖结构到解剖结构的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注肿瘤生长而忽略了相邻解剖结构的伴随变化，而现实中肿瘤演变是高度非线性和异质性的，受到治疗干预、空间背景和邻近组织相互作用的共同影响。因此，需要同时建模肿瘤进展和周围解剖结构以获得全面且临床相关的疾病动态理解。

Method: 使用基于单纯形的多类概率场表示解剖结构，通过交叉扩散反应扩散系统演化，该系统强制执行类间竞争和排他性。采用可微分隐式-显式方案处理刚性扩散和非线性反应项，并通过投影回到单纯形。引入拓扑正则化器同时保持中心线并惩罚区域重叠。

Result: 在合成数据集和临床数据集上验证了该方法。在合成基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的准确性同时保持拓扑结构，在临床数据集上也表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过整合PDE动力学、拓扑感知正则化和可微分求解器，这项工作为数字孪生建立了一个原则性的解剖结构到解剖结构生成路径，实现了视觉真实、解剖排他和拓扑一致的生成。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

Motivation: 肝纤维化是肝脏损伤导致细胞外基质过度积累的病理过程，传统分期方法具有侵入性风险。需要开发非侵入性、自动化的评估方法。

Conclusion: 该管道为基于MRI的肝纤维化定量评估提供了快速、可重复的框架，支持早期诊断和临床决策。

Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our
proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI
modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.
This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative
MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. Code is available at

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变分级具有序数性和长尾分布特性，少数阶段样本稀缺但临床检测至关重要。传统方法使用各向同性高斯先验和对称损失函数，与任务的不对称性质不匹配

Method: 基于Wasserstein自编码器，采用非对称先验保持少数类的重尾和偏斜结构；使用MAOC损失确保等级有序可分性；引入方向感知序数损失，通过轻量级头预测非对称分散生成软标签，对低估分级施加更严重惩罚

Conclusion: 该方法将潜在流形重塑为紧凑、等级有序的簇，减少重叠，为糖尿病视网膜病变分级提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在双曲流形上的优化方法，扩展了双曲随机梯度下降为双曲Adam优化器，并展示了在扩散模型训练中的加速收敛效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，探索双曲流形上的优化方法，特别是针对Poincaré球上的学习问题，旨在利用双曲嵌入表示来加速训练初期的收敛速度。

Method: 将双曲随机梯度下降扩展为双曲Adam优化器，结合双曲时间离散化的Langevin动力学，在扩散模型中应用双曲优化方法进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，使用双曲优化方法训练扩散模型可以在某些数据集上实现更快的收敛速度，同时不牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法不仅适用于Poincaré球学习，在欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置中也能带来益处，特别是在参数远离最优解的早期训练阶段能加速收敛。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术来统一冲突指标。

Conclusion: 田口方法为CNN超参数优化提供了有效的系统化框架，能够识别关键参数并实现高性能，为深度学习优化提供了新的工程化思路。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态之间的协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值，这导致在关键任务中表现不佳

Method: 采用随机遮挡大部分模态特征的无限掩码策略，通过互信息最大化将未掩码融合表示与掩码表示对齐，以编码全面的协同信息

Result: 在控制实验中证明InfMasking有效增强模态间协同信息，在大型真实数据集上七个基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Motivation: 现有的主动测试时适应方法使用启发式不确定性度量，数据选择效率低，浪费人工标注预算。需要一种有理论保证的不确定性度量方法来提高效率。

Method: 使用平滑保形分数和top-K确定性度量，基于伪覆盖率的在线权重更新算法，域偏移检测器来调整人工监督，以及平衡人工标注和模型标注数据的分阶段更新方案。

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了UOT-RFM框架，通过无标签的逆重加权策略解决长尾分布下流匹配的多数类偏差问题，在不使用类别标签的情况下提升尾部类别的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布中存在多数类偏差问题，导致少数类模式生成质量低且无法匹配真实类别比例。现有方法通常需要类别标签信息，限制了应用范围。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优运输构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的无标签多数分数进行逆重加权，理论上实现一阶校正，经验上通过高阶校正进一步提升尾部类别生成。

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，同时在平衡数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM为无标签的长尾分布生成建模提供了有效解决方案，通过几何结构数据驱动的重加权策略成功缓解了多数类偏差问题。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Motivation: 解决现有TDG方法因仅预测分类器层而无法调整其他模型组件的问题，以及全模型预测计算成本过高的问题

Method: 首先通过约束权重变化在单个时域上微调域无关基础模型来创建功能多样但参数相似的专家模型；其次通过在主成分子空间中建模时域权重轨迹来优化偏差-方差权衡，使用自适应平均系数

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2个TDG设置上的广泛实验显示，TEA比现有TDG方法性能提升高达69%，效率提升高达60倍

Conclusion: TEA框架在时域泛化任务中实现了更好的性能和更高的效率，为大规模模型的时域适应提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述通常缺少推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是因为推理能力不足，而是因为缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习（AC-RL），通过训练过程中的澄清请求来识别信息缺口，并惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，从而促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL相比预训练基线平均准确率提高了4.4个百分点，并且能够减少最多39%的澄清请求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习就能有效改进视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，为视觉推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Conclusion: 这项工作为从语言预训练中刻意培养视觉先验提供了新方法，为下一代多模态LLMs的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

Method: 开发了包含1,309个精心策划查询的基准，涵盖自然图像、图表和视觉谜题等多样化多模态数据，支持包含多个图像的复杂查询和文档。

Result: 当前最先进模型在MR^2-Bench上表现不佳，例如Seed1.6-Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，但在MR^2-Bench上仅为9.91，显示出显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: MR^2-Bench提出了更高的挑战，凸显了在推理密集型多模态检索领域进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

### [156] [Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25219)
*Md. Atiqur Rahman,MM Fazle Rabbi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一个数学框架，将压缩比、编码时间和解码时间整合为统一性能评分，用于客观比较不同无损压缩算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩算法在不同性能维度上存在权衡，难以选择同时满足多种关键指标的应用场景（如医疗影像需要紧凑存储和快速检索）

Method: 通过数学建模将压缩比、编码时间、解码时间归一化并加权平衡，建立统一性能评分框架

Result: 实验验证该框架能可靠识别不同优先级设置下的最优压缩器，发现现代学习型编解码器压缩比优越，但传统算法在速度要求高时仍有优势

Conclusion: 该框架为选择最优无损压缩技术提供了稳健且适应性强的决策支持工具，连接理论指标与实际应用需求

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RADAR框架，通过多智能体协作辩论机制重构风险概念空间，显著提升大语言模型安全评估的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，通过四个专业互补角色的多轮辩论机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，有效解决了现有安全评估方法的局限性，为大语言模型安全评估提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器方法，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答需要比较不同时间点的配对研究，回答关于临床有意义变化的问题。在这种情况下，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量。

Method: 方法包括轻量级仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后执行两步骤循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM获得疾病聚焦显著性；第二步将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。骨干网络和解码器使用通用领域预训练，无需放射学特定预训练。

Conclusion: 结果表明，带有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可转移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: IRIS框架通过最大化自不确定性来改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需外部奖励或人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF在语言推理中成功，但在自回归T2I生成中受限于人工偏好数据的稀缺性。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励（最大化自不确定性）进行强化学习，改进自回归T2I模型。

Result: IRIS在自回归T2I模型上达到与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性能够改善图像生成质量，与人类偏好更一致。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，用于分析视觉语言模型中哪些层可以被跳过以提高推理效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能强大，但推理成本高昂。现有研究表明选择性跳过某些层可以提高效率，但缺乏对何时跳过层有益的理论理解。

Method: 开发了一个信息论和学习理论框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化过程，识别具有较大冗余的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过框架识别的冗余层可以加速推理并保持性能，而在不适用的条件下跳过层会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论基础，证明了基于信息论的层跳过策略的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理（分解和重组概念解决新问题）方面存在困难。现有的神经符号方法受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune采用混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，结合命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。该框架以无需训练的方式运行，具有模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，同时支持可微操作进行微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域的评估中，NePTune相比强大的基础模型有显著改进，并在对抗性测试中表现出有效的组合泛化和在新环境中的适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架成功克服了传统神经符号方法的局限性，通过软逻辑操作和动态程序生成，显著提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN判别器的离散瓶颈来破坏后门触发器，同时保持语义内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适合实际训练流程。需要开发更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用Vector-Quantized VAE结合GAN判别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN判别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%的中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。相比扩散模型防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了计算效率，适合实际训练流程部署。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与NAS结合的方法存在架构无效性、计算效率低和性能不如传统NAS等关键限制，需要改进。

Method: 提出协作LLM-NAS框架，包含导航器LLM指导搜索方向，生成器LLM合成高质量候选，协调器模块管理两者交互，结合LLM的结构化知识和迭代反馈。

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过协作LLM框架有效解决了NAS中的关键问题，展示了卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间跨度的具身规划面临挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体的行动而改变，外生过程（如水的加热、多米诺骨牌的连锁反应）也会与智能体行动同时发生。现有方法难以有效处理这种并发变化。

Method: 提出一个框架，联合学习（i）符号状态表示和（ii）内生行动和外生机制的因果过程。每个因果过程建模一个随机因果效应关系的时间进程。通过变分贝叶斯推断结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习这些世界模型。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并能推广到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务中，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理具身规划中的并发变化问题，通过学习抽象世界模型实现了在复杂环境中的泛化规划能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Motivation: 现有的联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和对中心服务器的依赖，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化的框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的端到端自动生成方法，用于创建矢量草图动画。通过引入可微分运动轨迹（DMT）表示来解决闪烁问题，该方法使用基于多项式的轨迹描述笔画控制点的逐帧运动，显著提高了语义一致性和时间连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于图像的草图绘制已经得到充分研究，但基于视频的草图动画生成由于时间连贯性要求仍然非常具有挑战性。现有方法在处理闪烁问题和保持时间一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出可微分运动轨迹（DMT）表示，使用可微分多项式轨迹描述笔画控制点的逐帧运动。采用伯恩斯坦基函数平衡多项式参数的敏感性，实现更稳定的优化。引入稀疏跟踪点进行显式空间建模，提高效率并支持长视频处理。

Conclusion: DMT表示通过全局语义梯度传播显著改善了语义一致性和时间连贯性，能够生成高帧率输出，为矢量草图动画生成提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Method: 通过结合丰富的作者档案数据和相关元数据，在多模态大语言模型上进行个性化图表标题生成的实验研究

Result: 实验表明作者档案数据能显著提升个性化性能，但揭示了风格匹配与标题质量之间的基本权衡关系

Conclusion: 为开发平衡风格匹配和质量的实用标题自动化系统提供了有价值的见解和未来方向

Abstract: We study personalized figure caption generation using author profile data
from scientific papers. Our experiments demonstrate that rich author profile
data, combined with relevant metadata, can significantly improve the
personalization performance of multimodal large language models. However, we
also reveal a fundamental trade-off between matching author style and
maintaining caption quality. Our findings offer valuable insights and future
directions for developing practical caption automation systems that balance
both objectives. This work was conducted as part of the 3rd SciCap challenge.

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.
