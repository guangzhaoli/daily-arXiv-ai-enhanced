### [1] [A Real-Time Diminished Reality Approach to Privacy in MR Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10466)
*Christian Fane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 实时减实系统通过语义分割和实时修复技术，在混合现实会议中实现隐私保护，能够以20+ fps的速度选择性移除敏感物体


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决共享空间混合现实会议中的隐私问题，让主要用户能够选择性移除环境中的个人或敏感物品，防止其他参与者看到这些对象

Method: 使用YOLOv11进行物体检测和语义分割，采用改进的解耦时空变换器(DSTT)模型进行高质量视频修复，通过移动ZED 2i深度相机实现实时处理，无需固定视角或预先3D扫描

Result: 在720p分辨率下，系统能够维持超过20 fps的帧率，实现了实时减实效果，验证了实用隐私保护MR应用的可行性

Conclusion: 该系统展示了实时减实技术在混合现实隐私保护应用中的可行性，为便携且鲁棒的隐私控制方案提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

### [2] [SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555)
*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi是当前最大最丰富的手术视觉语言数据集，包含24万视频片段-字幕对，覆盖200多种手术程序，提供分层标注。通过自动化流水线生成高质量注释，并发布开源版本SurgLaVi-β。基于此数据集开发的SurgCLIP模型在多项手术任务中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手术视觉语言预训练数据集存在规模小、程序多样性不足、语义质量差和缺乏层次结构等问题，限制了手术VLP的发展。

Method: 开发了SurgLaVi数据集，采用全自动流水线系统生成细粒度手术视频转录，通过双模态过滤去除噪声样本，提供阶段、步骤和任务三个层次的分层标注。基于此构建了SurgCLIP模型，采用CLIP风格的双编码器视频-文本对比学习框架。

Result: SurgCLIP在阶段识别、步骤识别、动作识别和工具识别等任务中 consistently 取得改进，大幅超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 大规模、语义丰富且具有层次结构的数据集能够直接转化为更强和更可泛化的表示，SurgLaVi成为开发手术基础模型的关键资源。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

### [3] [Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620)
*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于SimCLR的自监督学习基础模型，用于3D脑结构MRI分析，在多个下游任务中表现优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D MRI深度学习模型多为特定任务设计，缺乏泛化能力，且现有的3D脑MRI基础模型在分辨率、范围或可访问性方面存在限制。

Method: 采用SimCLR自监督学习方法，在11个公开数据集的18,759名患者（44,958次扫描）上进行预训练，构建高分辨率3D脑MRI基础模型。

Result: 模型在四个不同的下游预测任务中均优于掩码自编码器(MAE)和两个监督基线，即使仅使用20%的标注样本进行微调，在阿尔茨海默病预测中仍表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个广泛适用且易于获取的临床脑MRI分析基础模型，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

### [4] [USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)
*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出USCTNet方法，通过物理约束和可学习低秩子空间解决RGB到高光谱图像重建问题，在重建精度上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像重建高光谱图像是一个不适定问题，当相机光谱敏感性和场景光照参数不准确时会导致物理不一致性

Method: 将RGB-to-HSI重建构建为基于物理的逆问题，使用可学习变换域中的核范数正则化，显式估计CSS和光照参数，并引入数据自适应的低秩子空间SVT算子

Result: 在标准基准测试中，相比最先进的RGB-based方法在重建精度上取得了一致性提升

Conclusion: USCTNet通过物理约束和深度展开求解器有效解决了RGB到高光谱图像的重建问题，确保了色度一致性并提高了计算稳定性

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

### [5] [A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683)
*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型在医学影像任务中的表现，发现其在胶质瘤分类和分割任务中表现不如传统CNN，特别是在空间理解能力方面存在明显局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在基于图像的医疗应用中的有效性，特别是在医学影像任务中的表现，与传统的卷积神经网络进行比较。

Method: 使用BraTS 2020多模态脑部MRI数据集，评估通用视觉-语言大语言模型（LLaMA 3.2 Instruct）在微调前后的性能，并与定制的3D CNN进行基准测试。

Result: CNN在胶质瘤分类中达到80%准确率，而通用LLM为76%但特异性仅18%。微调后特异性提升至55%但整体性能下降。在分割任务中，LLM始终将预测集中在图像中心，无法区分肿瘤大小和位置。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM不适合基于图像的任务，需要更严格的微调或替代训练策略才能在医疗领域实现更好的性能、鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

### [6] [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687)
*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D是一个从单目输入生成配对RGB和运动学部件视频的框架，通过双分支扩散模型联合合成RGB帧和部件分割图，能够生成跨视角和时间一致的动态部件结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的部件分割方法依赖外观语义线索，无法产生与物体运动结构一致的动态部件。需要一种能够生成运动学部件的方法，这些部件与物体运动对齐并在不同视角和时间上保持一致。

Method: 采用双分支扩散模型，引入空间颜色编码方案将部件掩码映射为连续RGB图像，共享RGB分支的潜在VAE。使用双向扩散融合模块增强跨分支一致性，并通过对比部件一致性损失促进空间和时间对齐。

Result: SP4D能够泛化到多样化场景，包括真实世界视频、新生成物体和罕见运动姿态，产生适合下游动画和运动相关任务的运动感知输出。生成的2D部件图可提升到3D以推导骨骼结构和皮肤权重。

Conclusion: SP4D提供了一个有效的框架，能够从单目输入生成高质量的运动学部件视频，为动画和运动相关应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

### [7] [SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10710)
*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR结合RGB和姿态信息，通过可提示零样本视频分割技术，专注于手语者的手部和身体部位，在ISLR任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ISLR方法主要依赖RGB数据或姿态信息，但结合这些模态时往往会丢失关键细节（如手形和方向），因为不精确的表示（如边界框）。

Method: 提出SegSLR系统，通过姿态信息粗略定位手部和身体，然后使用可提示零样本视频分割技术分割相应部位，保持所有相关形状信息，并聚焦RGB数据处理于最相关的身体部位。

Result: 在复杂的ChaLearn249 IsoGD数据集上评估显示，SegSLR优于最先进的方法。消融研究表明，专注于手语者的身体和手部带来了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: SegSLR通过有效结合RGB和姿态信息，专注于关键身体部位，在手语识别任务中取得了更好的性能，验证了设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

### [8] [SCOPE: Speech-guided COllaborative PErception Framework for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10748)
*Jecia Z. Y. Mao,Francis X Creighton,Russell H Taylor,Manish Sahu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE框架结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型，通过语音指导实现手术场景的实时分割、标注和跟踪，无需手动提示或标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前手术场景分割方法依赖标注数据和领域特定模型的限制，开发能够在术中环境下实时适应新场景的开放集分割系统

Method: 集成LLM的推理能力和开放集VFM的感知能力，通过语音反馈指导分割，使用手术器械作为交互指针标注其他场景元素

Result: 在Cataract1k数据集和内部颅底数据集上验证了实时分割和跟踪能力，通过活体模拟实验展示了动态性能

Conclusion: 这种人机协作范式展示了开发适应性强、免提、以外科医生为中心的手术室工具的潜力

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

### [9] [Every Camera Effect, Every Time, All at Once: 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Physics-based Camera Effect Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10759)
*Yi-Ruei Liu,You-Zhe Xie,Yu-Hsiang Hsu,I-Sheng Fang,Yu-Lun Liu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT是一种新的两阶段流水线，结合4D高斯泼溅和基于物理的光线追踪，用于模拟相机效果，解决真实世界相机效应在计算机视觉系统中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉系统假设理想针孔相机，但在面对鱼眼畸变、滚动快门等真实相机效应时表现不佳，主要缺乏带有相机效应的训练数据。现有数据生成方法成本高、存在模拟到现实的差距或无法准确建模相机效应。

Method: 提出4D高斯光线追踪（4D-GRT）两阶段流水线：首先使用4D高斯泼溅重建动态场景，然后应用光线追踪生成具有可控、物理准确的相机效果的视频。

Result: 4D-GRT实现了最快的渲染速度，同时渲染质量优于或与现有基线相当。构建了8个合成动态场景作为基准测试集，涵盖4种相机效果。

Conclusion: 4D-GRT为解决计算机视觉系统中真实相机效应问题提供了高效准确的解决方案，通过物理准确的光线追踪模拟实现了高质量的相机效果生成。

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

*Marcelo Sandoval-Castaneda,Bryan Russell,Josef Sivic,Gregory Shakhnarovich,Fabian Caba Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于多智能体的视频编辑自动化系统，通过编辑器和评论家智能体的协作，使用自然语言指令完成视频编辑任务，在覆盖范围、时间约束满足和人类偏好方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频编辑工具主要关注检索或用户界面，将实际编辑工作留给用户，而本文旨在自动化视频编辑的核心任务

Method: 采用多智能体方法，设计编辑器智能体（使用视频编辑工具处理输入视频和自然语言指令）和评论家智能体（提供自然语言反馈或渲染满意结果），并引入基于学习的方法实现专业智能体间的有效通信

Result: 通过用户研究对输出视频序列进行定性和定量评估，显示系统在覆盖范围、时间约束满足和人类偏好方面大幅超越现有方法

Conclusion: 多智能体方法能够有效解决语言驱动的视频编辑任务，LLM作为评判指标的评估方法与人类偏好高度一致

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出稳定性感知框架，通过机器学习从非对比MRI预测胶质瘤对比增强，减少对钆基对比剂的依赖，在多中心验证中达到平均0.93的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂存在安全性、成本和可及性问题，而对比增强反映肿瘤侵袭性且对治疗规划很重要，需要开发可靠的替代方案。

Method: 使用来自四个TCIA数据集的1,446例胶质瘤病例，提取108个影像组学特征，结合48种降维方法和25个分类器构建1,200个pipeline，采用旋转验证方法进行多中心测试。

Result: 交叉验证准确率0.91-0.96，外部测试准确率平均0.93（范围0.87-0.98），F1、精确率和召回率稳定（0.87-0.96），MI+ETr pipeline表现最佳。

Conclusion: 稳定性感知模型选择能够实现从非对比MRI可靠预测对比增强，提高跨中心泛化能力，为神经肿瘤学及其他领域提供可复现的机器学习模板。

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

*Yilun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测器无关的后处理框架，通过重叠切片恢复低置信度候选目标，结合空间和语义聚类验证群体证据，并进行置信度重加权，显著提高了无人机图像中小目标的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机图像中由于远距离视角、遮挡和杂乱背景导致密集小目标漏检的问题。

Method: 采用重叠切片技术恢复低置信度候选目标，使用基于DBSCAN的空间聚类（框中心点）和语义聚类（ResNet-18嵌入）验证群体证据，然后进行置信度重加权和类别感知NMS融合。

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上，召回率从0.685提升至0.778（+0.093），精确度从0.801调整至0.595，F1分数达到0.669，后处理延迟平均为0.095秒每图像。

Conclusion: 该框架无需重新训练即可与现代检测器集成，在召回敏感应用中表现出色，未来将降低语义门控成本并引入时序线索。

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

Motivation: 现有3D场景数据集存在数据规模或多样性不足、布局过于简化缺乏小物件、以及严重物体碰撞等问题，限制了具身AI的发展。

Method: 整合三种场景来源（真实扫描、程序生成、设计师创建），通过综合数据处理流程确保可模拟性，包括创建真实到模拟的副本、添加交互对象和通过物理模拟解决碰撞问题。

Result: 创建了包含40,000个场景、196万个对象的数据集，平均每个区域41.5个对象，具有复杂真实的布局。在场景布局生成和点目标导航两个基准应用中展示了新挑战。

Conclusion: InternScenes为复杂场景中的生成和导航任务提供了大规模训练数据，推动了模型训练的规模化，并将开源数据、模型和基准以惠及整个研究社区。

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

Conclusion: 该框架能够量化不确定性，使临床医生能够在任何未来时间里程碑评估肿瘤进展风险，提高了预测模型的稳定性和准确性

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过点平面投影有效学习2D表示特征，仅使用LiDAR数据就能在有限数据场景下实现优异性能，为3D环境理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D为3D城市场景理解提供了一个灵活且可扩展的解决方案，能够处理任意文本查询的零样本分割任务。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: AutoOEP是一个有效且资源高效的自动监考解决方案，能够增强在线评估的完整性

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

Method: 建立端到端SD-CASSI数学模型，引入TV亚梯度理论和动态正则化策略，利用RGB/全色参考图像的归一化梯度约束构建严格凸优化保证的相似性函数，设计自适应参考生成更新机制提供亚梯度指导。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效保持了空间-光谱结构一致性，在不同重建场景下均表现出鲁棒性能，为计算光谱成像建立了可解释的数学理论基础。

Conclusion: 所提出的双相机CASSI重建框架成功解决了传统方法的局限性，通过TV亚梯度理论和自适应参考机制实现了性能与可解释性的平衡，为计算光谱成像提供了坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前地球观测领域的大型基础模型计算成本高昂，限制了其在下游任务中的可访问性和重用性，需要探索更紧凑的架构。

Method: 使用Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder架构，结合图像数据与经纬度坐标、季节/日循环编码等元数据，在BigEarthNet-Landsat数据集上进行预训练。

Result: 尽管模型规模很小，但在线性探测评估中与大型架构竞争，元数据感知预训练提高了迁移和标签效率，在缺乏显式元数据的EuroSAT-Landsat数据集上也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 紧凑的元数据感知MoE-MAE模型是迈向未来地球观测基础模型的高效且可扩展的一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

Motivation: 解决HR-pQCT中刚性运动伪影（如皮质骨条纹和小梁骨模糊）对骨微结构评估的阻碍，缺乏标准化退化模型和运动校正方法

Method: 优化基于正弦图的运动伪影模拟方法创建配对数据集，提出ESWGAN-GP网络，包含边缘增强跳跃连接、自注意力机制和VGG感知损失

Result: 在模拟数据集上SNR=26.78, SSIM=0.81, VIF=0.76；在真实数据集上SNR=29.31, SSIM=0.87, VIF=0.81

Conclusion: 该方法虽然是对真实运动复杂性的简化表示，但为解决HR-pQCT运动伪影这一关键挑战提供了重要初步步骤

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

Motivation: 当前皮肤色调识别和生成任务面临数据集缺乏和方法论不足的挑战，大型多模态模型和图像生成模型在此方面表现不佳，存在显著偏差。

Method: 构建TrueSkin数据集，系统收集不同光照条件、相机角度和拍摄设置的图像，并基于该数据集对现有识别和生成方法进行基准测试。

Result: 发现现有模型存在明显偏差：LMMs倾向于将中间肤色误分类为较浅肤色，生成模型受提示词中无关属性影响难以准确生成指定肤色。使用TrueSkin训练的识别模型比LMMs和传统方法准确率提高20%以上，微调后显著提升图像生成模型的肤色保真度。

Conclusion: TrueSkin数据集不仅可作为评估现有模型的基准，还能作为有价值的训练资源，提升皮肤色调识别和生成任务的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

Conclusion: 该方法通过动作典型性和独特性学习，有效解锁了骨架数据在零样本视频异常检测中的潜力，实现了跨场景的强泛化能力

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal
microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited
to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable
pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we
developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed
with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract
detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the
cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid
Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of
spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst
formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating
comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework,
Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating
research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The
platform is publicly available as open-source software at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态融合的行星漫游车可通行性成本地图预测框架，融合相机和LiDAR数据，通过自监督IMU标签训练，具有高度鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够准确预测行星表面可通行性成本地图的系统，为行星漫游车的自主导航提供可靠支持，解决传统方法依赖人工标注和缺乏鲁棒性的问题。

Method: 使用DINOv3图像编码器和FiLM传感器融合技术，结合相机和LiDAR数据生成鸟瞰图成本地图，采用自监督学习方式利用IMU数据生成训练标签，优化损失函数结合Huber和平滑项。

Result: 模型表现出高度鲁棒性，在去除图像颜色、遮挡输入和添加噪声等消融实验中，MAE/MSE仅出现微小变化（如LiDAR稀疏化时MAE从0.0775升至0.0915），表明几何信息主导学习成本。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了多模态可通行性预测，主要贡献包括高保真仿真环境、自监督IMU标注流程和强大的多模态BEV成本地图预测模型，未来工作将关注领域泛化和数据集扩展。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

Conclusion: 控制辅助注意力机制能有效提升端到端自动驾驶系统的性能，使注意力关注引发动作输出高方差的视觉特征，而非仅仅最小化训练损失

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

Conclusion: LoRA适配方法为全景视频生成提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，仅需少量训练数据即可实现优异性能

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Conclusion: SMILE方法提供了渐进式理论支持，设计了超分辨率指导下的解混新框架，解决了任务亲和性和收敛性保证问题

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our
smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码剪枝方法（如MaskGS）的全局均值正则化与决定图像质量的逐像素重建损失不匹配，需要更精确的稀疏化方法。

Method: 引入空间变体正则化器SVR-GS，从每个高斯沿射线的有效贡献渲染逐像素空间掩码，在低重要性高斯上施加稀疏压力。探索三种空间掩码聚合策略，CUDA实现并进行梯度分析。

Result: 在Tanks&Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF360数据集上，平均减少高斯数量1.79倍（vs MaskGS）和5.63倍（vs 3DGS），PSNR仅下降0.50dB和0.40dB。

Conclusion: SVR-GS产生更小、更快、内存效率更高的模型，适用于机器人、AR/VR和移动感知等实时应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了Multispectral-NeRF，一种基于NeRF的增强神经网络架构，能够有效整合多光谱信息进行3D重建，解决了现有方法无法处理多波段信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建技术主要依赖RGB光谱信息，现有多光谱重建方法存在成本高、精度低、几何特征差等问题。虽然NeRF能有效解决多光谱3D重建的各种问题，但当前NeRF及其改进模型只能处理三波段数据，无法充分利用多波段信息。

Method: 对NeRF架构进行三方面改进：扩展隐藏层维度以容纳6波段光谱输入；重新设计残差函数以优化重建图像与参考图像之间的光谱差异计算；调整数据压缩模块以适应多光谱图像增加的位深要求。

Result: 实验结果表明，Multispectral-NeRF成功处理了多波段光谱特征，同时准确保留了原始场景的光谱特性。

Conclusion: 所提出的Multispectral-NeRF架构能够有效整合多光谱信息，为多光谱3D重建提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Conclusion: SPHERE成功解决了现有方法在物理规律捕捉和计算效率方面的局限性，为自动驾驶场景的3D语义感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

Conclusion: StegOT通过最优传输理论有效解决了模式崩溃问题，在图像隐写领域取得了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI皮肤病变分类模型易受肤色偏见影响，FST量表因对浅肤色有更细粒度分类而受到批评，需要研究FST量表粒度对模型性能和偏见的影响。

Method: 训练多个AI模型使用不同粒度的FST特定数据进行良恶性病变分类，比较三组分类(FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6)与一般平衡数据集的性能差异。

Result: 使用三组FST特定数据训练的模型性能普遍优于平衡数据集模型；降低FST信息粒度(从1/2和3/4到1/2/3/4)会对性能产生不利影响。

Conclusion: FST分组粒度对病变分类模型训练至关重要，鉴于FST量表可能存在人为偏见，应转向能更好代表人类肤色多样性的替代量表进行公平AI研究。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

Conclusion: 概率化的分量式空间变换网络为细粒度视觉分类提供了有效的几何规范化解决方案，具有灵活性、主干网络无关性和无架构约束的优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of
modality-specific discrete encoding.

Conclusion: CMLReID框架成功解决了LReID-Hybrid任务，能够在持续学习设置下同时实现同服装和服装变化场景的行人重识别

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

Conclusion: 通过属性建模和跨域对齐，无需排练即可有效减少知识遗忘同时缓解域偏移

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

TL;DR: ROSGS是一种基于高斯泼溅表示的两阶段管道，用于高效重建可重光照的户外场景，通过混合光照模型实现高精度重光照和渲染效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外图像数据通常包含无界场景和变化的照明条件，现有方法如NeRF计算开销大，而3DGS使用低频光照表示导致重光照精度不足

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段利用单目法线先验和2D高斯泼溅重建场景几何；第二阶段通过混合光照模型分解纹理和光照，使用球面高斯函数捕捉高频阳光分量，球谐系数建模低频天光

Result: 定量指标和定性比较表明，ROSGS在户外场景重光照方面达到最先进性能，具有优越的重光照精度和渲染效率

Conclusion: ROSGS通过高效的几何重建和混合光照表示，成功解决了户外场景重光照的挑战，在精度和效率方面均优于现有方法

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

TL;DR: APASI是一种无需外部依赖的自主偏好对齐方法，通过自注入幻觉来缓解大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉缓解方法主要基于偏好对齐，需要外部人工标注或辅助模型来收集偏好数据，这增加了成本并限制了持续改进。

Method: APASI利用目标LVLM自注入幻觉到生成的响应中，创建具有不同偏好水平的响应对。通过三个关键幻觉观察生成不受偏好的响应，并采用迭代对齐训练策略结合课程学习。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，APASI不仅有效缓解了三个基线模型的幻觉问题，而且取得了与依赖外部资源的方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: APASI展示了一种无需外部依赖的有效幻觉缓解方法，具有很好的泛化能力，为LVLM的持续改进提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用几何基础模型的几何先验来解决未对齐场景变化检测中的核心挑战，包括可靠识别视觉重叠、鲁棒对应关系建立和显式遮挡检测，无需训练即可实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅依赖2D视觉线索建立跨图像对应关系，但大视角变化会导致外观匹配漂移或失败，且小规模SCD数据集的2D变化掩码监督限制了通用多视图知识的学习，缺乏显式几何推理是一个关键但被忽视的局限性。

Method: 提出一个无需训练的框架，利用几何基础模型的几何先验，并与视觉基础模型的强大表示相结合，实现可靠的视角未对齐变化检测。

Result: 在PSCD、ChangeSim和PASLCD数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法实现了优越且鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何先验和视觉基础模型的结合，有效解决了未对齐场景变化检测中的几何推理缺失问题，为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

TL;DR: UnLoc是一种基于数据驱动的序列相机定位方法，利用现成预训练的单目深度模型，通过概率建模和不确定性估计，在floorplan中实现高效定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在深度预测中缺乏不确定性建模，以及需要为每个环境定制训练深度网络的问题。floorplan数据易获取、持久性强且对视觉变化鲁棒。

Method: 提出新颖的概率模型，将深度预测建模为显式概率分布，利用现成预训练的单目深度模型，无需为每个环境训练定制网络。

Result: 在大规模合成和真实数据集上评估，相比现有方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著提升。在LaMAR HGE数据集上，长序列(100帧)定位召回率提高2.7倍，短序列(15帧)提高16.7倍。

Conclusion: UnLoc通过不确定性建模和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了序列相机在floorplan中的定位性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SIKNet的语义独立卡尔曼网络，用于多目标跟踪中的运动估计，通过语义独立编码器处理状态向量，在非平稳运动场景下优于传统卡尔曼滤波和其他学习辅助滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于线性恒定速度模型的卡尔曼滤波器在参数不匹配和物体非平稳运动时效果不佳，需要更鲁棒的学习辅助滤波方法来提升多目标跟踪的运动估计性能。

Method: 使用语义独立编码器(SIE)分两步编码状态向量：首先用1D卷积处理同质语义元素，然后用全连接层和非线性激活层处理异质语义元素之间的非线性关系和交叉依赖信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SIKNet在构建的大规模半模拟数据集上优于传统卡尔曼滤波，并在鲁棒性和准确性方面超越了现有的学习辅助滤波器。

Conclusion: SIKNet通过语义独立的编码策略有效提升了多目标跟踪中运动估计的性能，特别是在非平稳运动场景下表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

*Mingyuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该博士研究探索了在医学图像计算中建模长距离视觉依赖的有效方法，比较了transformer和MLP在捕捉细粒度全局上下文方面的性能，发现MLP在处理高分辨率医学图像特征方面优于transformer和CNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析需要同时捕捉全局长距离上下文和局部细微视觉特征，但现有方法如CNN受限于局部性，transformer计算开销大难以处理高分辨率特征，需要寻找更有效的长距离依赖建模方法。

Method: 研究首先创新性地使用transformer处理像素级和图像级医学视觉任务，然后重点开发基于MLP的视觉模型来捕捉医学图像中的细粒度长距离视觉依赖关系。

Result: 大量实验证实了长距离依赖建模在医学图像计算中的关键作用，并发现MLP能够在包含丰富解剖/病理细节的高分辨率医学特征中建模更细粒度的长距离依赖。

Conclusion: MLP在建模细粒度长距离依赖方面优于transformer和CNN，能够持续提升各种医学视觉任务的性能，为下一代医学视觉骨干网络奠定了基础。

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用双波段热成像相机分离反射和发射光成分的方法，能够估计表面发射率和时变温度，同时隔离动态背景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在近环境温度条件下，热成像中的反射光和发射光成分通常大小相当且随时间变化，传统方法假设单一成分主导或第二成分恒定的做法不适用，需要新的分离方法。

Method: 使用两个不同光谱灵敏度的热成像相机，推导双波段热成像图像形成模型，开发算法估计表面发射率和时变温度，同时隔离动态背景。

Result: 通过精确校准多种材料的发射率进行定量评估，并在复杂日常场景（如装有热液体的玻璃杯和移动人物背景）上展示定性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了热成像视频中反射和发射光成分的有效分离，为理解物体属性（发射率、温度、反射率和形状）提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL在实例一致性不保证的情况下仍能学习有意义的表示，适度的视图多样性可以提升性能，但过度多样性会降低效果。使用EMD测量视图间互信息发现中等EMD值与改进的SSL学习相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自监督学习依赖于实例一致性假设，但对于非标志性数据，这一假设不成立，因为不同视图可能包含不同的对象或语义信息。本文旨在研究当实例一致性无法保证时SSL的有效性。

Method: 通过广泛的消融研究，分析SSL在缺乏严格实例一致性的正样本对上的表现。采用Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)作为估计器来测量视图间的互信息，并探索不同视图多样性设置的影响。

Result: 研究发现SSL即使在没有严格实例一致性的情况下仍能学习有意义的表示。增加视图多样性（通过强制零重叠或使用更小的裁剪尺度）可以提升分类和密集预测任务的下游性能，但过度多样性会降低效果。中等EMD值与改进的SSL学习相关。

Conclusion: 适度的视图多样性对SSL性能有积极影响，但需要控制在最优范围内。EMD可以作为有效的互信息测量工具，为未来SSL框架设计提供重要见解。研究结果在不同设置和数据源上都表现出鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

TL;DR: 提出两种正则化策略来增强CNN对图像损坏的鲁棒性：通过低频滤波一致性损失减少对高频纹理的依赖，以及使用监督对比学习构建基于形状的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN过度依赖局部纹理特征而非全局形状信息，导致对常见图像损坏的鲁棒性较差，而人类视觉系统更注重形状信息。

Method: 1) 辅助损失函数：强制原始图像与低频滤波图像的特征一致性，减少对高频纹理的依赖；2) 监督对比学习：构建以类别一致性和形状相关性为中心的特征空间结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C基准测试中，两种方法都提高了对图像损坏的鲁棒性，同时保持了原始准确率。

Conclusion: 损失级别的正则化可以有效地引导CNN学习更具形状感知和鲁棒性的特征表示。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

Conclusion: GLaVE-Cap通过全局-局部对齐和视觉专家集成，有效解决了视频详细描述中的细节缺失和上下文不一致问题，为视频理解社区提供了新的基准和数据集资源。

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 现有状态空间模型（如Mamba）虽然通过输入依赖性选择性在三个关键参数上表现出潜力，但控制时间记忆的关键遗忘门（A矩阵）仍然是静态的，这限制了模型的表达能力

Method: 引入专家混合方法，基于输入特征动态选择上下文相关的A矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时增强表示能力

Result: 在50Salads、Breakfast和Assembly101数据集上的广泛实验表明，MixANT在所有评估设置中始终优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了输入依赖性遗忘门机制对于在不同现实场景中可靠预测人类行为的重要性

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出基于超网络的动态模型生成方法，解决多模态医学影像数据中部分缺失的问题，相比现有方法在数据不完整情况下准确率提升最高8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实临床环境中多模态医学影像数据常存在部分缺失，传统方法要么丢弃缺失样本、需要数据填补，要么重新设计dropout学习方案，限制了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用超网络方法，根据可用模态集合动态生成任务特定的分类模型参数，而不是训练固定模型，从而能够在所有样本上进行训练和推理，无论数据完整性如何。

Result: 在仅有25%完整度的数据集上训练时，该方法相比最先进的通道dropout方法和填补方法，准确率绝对提升最高达8%，表现出卓越的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过使单一模型能够泛化到所有模态配置，该方法为现实世界多模态医学数据分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射方法虽然解决了神经辐射场渲染慢和反向映射的问题，但线性混合蒙皮无法正确处理高斯分布的非线性旋转特性，导致伪影。

Method: 使用加权旋转混合方法，通过四元数平均来正确旋转高斯分布的非线性属性，只需修改线性混合蒙皮技术即可实现。

Result: 该方法能够有效消除伪影，创建更简单基于顶点的高斯分布，可以高效动画化并集成到任何引擎中。

Conclusion: 提出的四元数平均加权旋转混合方法为高斯溅射提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，无需复杂的网格属性或训练校正模型。

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过潜在空间旋转解耦生物和技术因素的方法，用于医学影像数据中的生物标志物发现，在多中心临床数据上显著提升了聚类一致性和生存预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据中存在由不同成像技术、设备和参数导致的域偏移问题，这阻碍了生物上有意义的聚类发现和数据表示学习。需要解耦生物因素和技术因素来改善多中心数据的分析。

Method: 通过后验旋转数据潜在空间来主动学习域偏移，实现生物因素和技术因素的有效解耦，从而获得稳定的跨域组织类型聚类表示。

Result: 在真实临床数据上，解耦表示相比纠缠表示将聚类一致性提升了19.01%(ARI)、16.85%(NMI)和12.39%(Dice)，优于四种最先进的协调方法，并增强了特发性肺纤维化患者的生存预测能力。

Conclusion: 该无标签框架能够促进多中心常规影像数据中的生物标志物发现，为诊断和预后评估提供支持，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on
GitHub https://github.com/cirmuw/latent-space-rotation-disentanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据中经常存在缺失的输入序列，这对依赖完整输入数据的深度学习模型构成挑战。

Method: 将每个MRI序列视为独立输入模态，使用晚期融合风格的transformer编码器整合多序列信息，并为每个模态设计单独的解码器流进行多任务重建。

Result: 在下游分割和分类任务中，相比MAE-ViT基线，在缺失输入序列情况下实现了10.1的绝对Dice分数提升和0.46的MCC改进。

Conclusion: 该预训练策略能够学习丰富的模态表示，并具备处理缺失输入的能力，为脑部MRI提供了一个灵活且可泛化的编码器框架。

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Motivation: 解决现有两帧方法缺乏长期时间上下文容易在稀疏或遮挡场景中失败，而序列方法计算成本过高的问题

Method: 提出轨迹基范式，首先生成快速显式运动提议，然后使用隐式运动建模模块预测未来轨迹来优化初始提议

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中达到新SOTA性能，跟踪精度提升4.48%，运行速度56 FPS，且在不同基础跟踪器上表现出强泛化性

Conclusion: 轨迹基范式有效平衡了跟踪精度和计算效率，为3D单目标跟踪提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外和可见光图像融合需要整合不同光谱域的互补结构纹理信息，现有方法缺乏对模态间交互的显式建模和任务关键区域的增强。

Method: 提出模态感知注意力机制动态调整特征贡献，像素级alpha混合模块学习空间变化的融合权重，目标感知损失利用弱ROI监督保持语义一致性。

Result: 在M3FD数据集上实验表明，FusionNet生成的融合图像具有增强的语义保持能力、高感知质量和清晰的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义感知的多模态图像融合提供了通用可扩展的解决方案，有利于目标检测和场景理解等下游任务。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

Conclusion: 提出的硬实例挖掘方法有效解决了MIL中的实例选择偏差问题，为计算病理学提供了更准确和高效的解决方案

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary

ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在GUI定位任务中表现不佳，尽管它们具有潜在的空间理解能力，但缺乏明确的坐标输出能力，且微调方法成本高昂。

Method: 提出三种零样本辅助推理方法：1）坐标轴方法，2）网格方法，3）标记交点方法，通过在输入图像中添加空间提示来引导模型表达其隐含的空间理解能力。

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间提示增强，可以有效激发视觉语言模型的潜在空间理解能力，实现零样本的GUI定位性能提升，避免了昂贵的数据标注和微调成本。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

Motivation: 解决基于高斯方法的SLAM系统计算性能瓶颈问题（<20 fps），显著落后于几何中心方法（数百fps）的现状

Method: 提出高斯-SDF混合表示：使用彩色SDF处理平滑几何和外观，3D高斯捕获细节；SDF通过RGB-D融合高效构建，高斯进行迭代优化

Result: 在真实Azure Kinect序列上实现超过150 fps的实时重建，高斯数量减少50%，优化迭代减少75%，速度提升一个数量级

Conclusion: 混合表示方法有效解决了高斯SLAM的计算瓶颈，在保持质量的同时实现了实时性能，为未来研究提供了新方向

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 所提出的HIL框架通过分层身份学习和多中心表示，有效解决了无监督跨模态行人重识别中的细粒度差异问题，取得了state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: BiCDO提供了一种有效的数据中心化方法，能够通过优化类别分布来提升多类别分类模型的性能和可靠性，特别适用于需要优先处理特定类别的应用场景

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data
distribution.

Conclusion: MVQA-68K数据集通过多维度评估和详细推理标注，为视频质量评估提供了更全面和可解释的解决方案，有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于softmax的帧分配策略，构建了图像和视频双基准测试，在UCF-Crime数据集上验证了异常聚焦采样方法的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频异常检测基准仅限于帧级或视频级任务，限制了模型泛化能力的全面评估，需要构建更全面的评测体系

Method: 提出softmax帧分配策略，优先选择异常密集片段同时保持全视频覆盖；构建图像基准（帧级推理）和视频基准（时序定位和异常评分）

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上，帧级和视频级检测性能均有提升；消融实验证实异常聚焦采样优于均匀和随机基线方法

Conclusion: 提出的双基准测试框架和异常优先采样策略为视频异常检测提供了更全面的评估标准，有助于提升模型性能

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D深度伪造方法存在几何不一致性和新视角泛化能力有限的问题，需要开发能够保持身份特征并支持完全可控3D空间操作的解决方案

Method: 结合参数化头部模型与动态高斯表示，显式分离头部和背景高斯，使用预训练2D指导优化面部区域，并引入修复模块增强极端姿态下的视觉一致性

Result: 在身份保持、姿态和表情一致性方面达到与最先进2D方法相当的性能，在多视角渲染质量和3D一致性方面显著优于2D方法

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了3D建模与深度伪造合成之间的差距，为场景感知、可控和沉浸式视觉伪造开辟了新方向，同时揭示了3D高斯泼溅技术可能被用于操纵攻击的潜在威胁

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

TL;DR: IS-Diff是一种无需训练的扩散模型修复方法，通过从非掩码区域采样初始化种子来避免语义不匹配问题，实现更和谐一致的图像修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在修复时使用随机噪声初始化，容易在掩码区域引入不匹配的语义信息，导致修复结果与未掩码区域不一致、不协调的问题。

Method: 提出IS-Diff方法：1）使用从非掩码区域采样的分布和谐种子作为初始化；2）设计动态选择性精炼机制，检测中间潜在空间中的不和谐修复并动态调整初始化先验强度。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ、ImageNet和Places2数据集的标准和大掩码修复任务中，该方法在所有指标上都优于最先进的修复方法。

Conclusion: IS-Diff通过分布和谐的初始化种子和改进的采样机制，有效解决了扩散模型修复中的语义不匹配问题，实现了更高质量的图像修复效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Motivation: 现有多天气图像修复方法主要使用混合单天气合成数据集进行训练和评估，但这些数据集在分辨率、风格和域特征上存在显著差异，导致严重的域差距问题，阻碍了统一模型的开发和公平评估。

Method: 构建了一个真实世界的多天气图像修复基准数据集，包含在各种天气条件（雨、雪、雾）以及不同户外场景和光照设置下捕获的图像对，提供精确对齐的退化图像和干净图像。

Result: 数据集支持监督学习和严格评估，通过基准测试验证了多种任务特定、任务通用和多合一修复方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集为推进真实场景中鲁棒且实用的多合一图像修复提供了宝贵的基础，并已公开发布。

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

Abstract: OCTA is a crucial non-invasive imaging technique for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
degeneration, and glaucoma. Current 2D-based methods for retinal vessel (RV)
segmentation offer insufficient accuracy. To address this, we propose RVMamba,
a novel architecture integrating multiple feature extraction modules with the
Mamba state-space model. Moreover, existing joint segmentation models for OCTA
data exhibit performance imbalance between different tasks. To simultaneously
improve the segmentation of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and mitigate this
imbalance, we introduce FAZMamba and a unified Joint-OCTAMamba framework.
Experimental results on the OCTA-500 dataset demonstrate that Joint-OCTAMamba
outperforms existing models across evaluation metrics.The code is available at

Motivation: 智能餐具清洁在食品安全和智能家居中至关重要，但现有方法受限于粗粒度分类和少样本数据稀缺，难以满足工业化需求。

Method: 提出DTGen方案：使用LoRA实现高效领域特化，通过结构化提示生成多样化脏污图像，采用CLIP跨模态过滤确保生成数据质量。

Result: 在极有限的真实少样本条件下，DTGen能合成几乎无限的高质量样本，显著改善分类器性能，支持细粒度脏餐具识别。

Conclusion: DTGen不仅验证了生成式AI在少样本工业视觉中的价值，还为自动化餐具清洁和食品安全监控提供了可行的部署路径，可与嵌入式洗碗机集成，智能调节能耗和洗涤剂使用。

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindVL是基于昇腾NPU训练的多模态大语言模型，采用原生分辨率视觉变换器处理变分辨率图像，避免固定分辨率分块导致的细节损失，在数据量仅为Qwen2.5-VL 1/10的情况下达到同等性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统固定分辨率图像处理导致的细节丢失问题，特别是在处理复杂图表和文档等视觉密集内容时，同时针对昇腾NPU平台优化多模态训练效率。

Method: 采用三阶段训练流程（预热阶段、多任务训练阶段、监督指令调优阶段），开发Mindspeed-MLLM分布式训练框架，实现算子等效替换，使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术，并引入测试时分辨率搜索和模型权重平均。

Result: MindVL在通用多模态理解和文档/表格理解评估中与Qwen2.5-VL性能相当，在OCR评估中表现领先，同时训练速度显著提升。

Conclusion: MindVL证明了在昇腾NPU上高效训练高性能多模态模型的可行性，原生分辨率处理能力和优化的训练框架使其在减少数据需求的同时保持优异性能。

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

segmentation, graph construction, and an iterative refinement procedure using a
routing engine. We evaluate the full end-to-end pipeline as well as individual
components, showing that the approach can robustly recover trail networks from
diverse map styles and generate GPS routes suitable for practical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计基准主要使用纹理丰富、低反射率的日常物品，限制了模型在工业场景中的泛化能力，因为工业物品通常是金属、无纹理且高反射的。

Method: 创建了IMD数据集，包含45个真实比例的工业组件，使用RGB-D相机在自然室内光照和不同物体排列下采集数据，评估了XMem、SAM2、BundleTrack和BundleSDF等先进模型。

Conclusion: IMD数据集填补了工业6D姿态估计的空白，为研究和开发更适合工业机器人应用的算法提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation
and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics
scenarios.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and
reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal
vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

Motivation: 扩展"主密钥滤波器假设"，探究深度可分离卷积网络中是否存在更基本的通用滤波器集合，以理解其内在收敛特性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过系统性的无监督搜索方法，在不同架构和数据集上提取通用滤波器模式，并使用这些冻结的通用滤波器初始化网络进行性能评估。

Result: 仅使用8个固定通用滤波器的网络在ImageNet上达到80%以上准确率，在小数据集上甚至优于拥有数千可训练参数的模型，这些滤波器与经典图像处理算子高度匹配。

Conclusion: 深度卷积层天然趋向于这组基础空间算子，与任务或架构无关，为理解泛化和迁移学习提供了新的视角和通用语言。

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

several state-of-the-art object detectors based on the RT-DETR, RT-DETRv2 and
DFINE architectures on a heterogeneous corpus of 150,000 documents (both openly

detections to make them more applicable to the document conversion task. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the layout analysis on various document
benchmarks using different methodologies while also measuring the runtime
performance across different environments (CPU, Nvidia and Apple GPUs). We
introduce five new document layout models achieving 20.6% - 23.9% mAP
improvement over Docling's previous baseline, with comparable or better
runtime. Our best model, "heron-101", attains 78% mAP with 28 ms/image
inference time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments establish best practices for training, evaluating, and
deploying document-layout detectors, providing actionable guidance for the

that MISRA achieves competitive performance, improving the mean class IoU by

instrument contacts and overlaps. These results position MISRA as a promising
step toward reliable scene parsing for computer-assisted and robotic

Conclusion: DGMap通过全局上下文感知有效提高了关键点检测精度，减少了稀疏轨迹区域的道路碎片化，并在密集轨迹区域抑制了错误连接

Abstract: Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to
its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven
trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and
redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing
methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework
with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding,
Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation
Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric
features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road
fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global
Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in
dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on
trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床环境中标注数据稀缺和任务特定模型泛化能力有限的问题，开发通用临床AI模型用于超声应用

Method: 使用自监督学习在包含450万张超声图像的EchoCareData数据集上训练，引入分层分类器实现像素级和表示级特征的联合学习

Result: 在10个代表性超声基准测试中（疾病诊断、病变分割、器官检测等）表现优于最先进模型

Conclusion: EchoCare提供了一个完全开放和可泛化的基础模型，可促进多样化临床超声应用AI技术的发展

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of
task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI
models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel
ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via
self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale
dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images,
sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse
range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are
multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt
off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a
hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,
quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code
and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for
fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional
applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model
to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSMA框架，通过多尺度特征融合和多属性学习，从单张无约束图像实现精确3D人脸重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大量3D人脸数据且难以捕捉多尺度细节特征，导致重建不完整或不准确

Method: 多尺度特征融合结合多属性学习，使用大核注意力模块增强跨尺度特征提取精度

Result: 在MICC Florence、Facewarehouse等数据集上达到与当前SOTA相当甚至更好的性能

Conclusion: MSMA框架有效解决了无约束环境下3D人脸重建的挑战，提升了重建精度和细节捕捉能力

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg2Track-SAM2是一个无需微调、检测器无关的多目标跟踪分割框架，通过结合预训练检测器、SAM2和新颖的Seg2Track模块，在KITTI基准测试中实现SOTA性能，内存使用减少75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基础模型在MOTS任务中身份管理和内存效率不足的问题，为自主系统在动态环境中提供更可靠的多目标跟踪分割能力。

Method: 集成预训练对象检测器与SAM2，引入Seg2Track模块处理轨迹初始化、管理和强化，采用滑动窗口内存策略优化内存使用。

Result: 在KITTI MOT和MOTS基准测试中达到SOTA性能，MOTS排名第四，关联精度创新高，内存使用减少75%且性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: Seg2Track-SAM2通过零样本跟踪、增强身份保持和高效内存利用，显著推进了MOTS技术的发展，适合资源受限环境部署。

Abstract: Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

Motivation: 解决SA-UNet在跳跃连接中注意力机制利用不足以及前景-背景类别不平衡的问题，同时提高模型在资源受限环境中的部署能力。

Method: 在SA-UNet基础上，向所有跳跃连接注入跨尺度空间注意力以增强多尺度特征融合，并采用加权BCE加MCC损失函数来处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在DRIVE和STARE数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，模型仅需1.2MB内存和0.26M参数（比SA-UNet减少50%以上），在CPU上1秒内完成592x592x3图像推理。

Conclusion: SA-UNetv2在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，特别适合在资源受限的CPU-only环境中部署，为视网膜疾病早期诊断提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,
demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained,
CPU-only settings.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
shown potential in general video understanding but faces significant challenges
when applied to the inherently complex domain of sports videos. In this work,
we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages
dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for
straightforward sports queries and ii) Deliberative Reasoning for more complex
ones. To bridge the knowledge gap between general-purpose models and
domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a
multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes
both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA
and Diving-QA, derived from the FineGym and FineDiving datasets, enabling
diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FineQuest achieves state-of-the-art
performance on these benchmarks as well as the existing SPORTU dataset, while
maintains strong general VideoQA capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络训练动态的不确定性感知标签增强框架，用于医学图像诊断中的不确定性建模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像诊断系统使用过于简化的one-hot标签，忽略了诊断不确定性，导致模型在面对噪声、模糊或冲突图像时做出过度自信的预测

Method: 利用神经网络训练动态评估每个训练样本的内在难度，通过聚合和校准训练过程中的模型预测来生成反映学习过程中歧义的不确定性感知伪标签

Result: 在心超分类基准测试中表现出色，在校准、选择性分类和多视图融合方面优于专门基线方法

Conclusion: 该架构无关的标签增强方法可应用于任何监督学习管道，显著提升不确定性估计和模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜血管分割对早期诊断视力威胁性疾病和系统性疾病至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在提取微小血管和计算成本方面仍面临挑战，特别是在计算资源有限的临床环境中。

Method: 提出LFRA-Net网络，在编码器-解码器瓶颈处集成焦点调制注意力机制，在选择性跳跃连接中使用区域感知注意力，有效捕获局部和全局依赖关系，增强特征表示和区域聚焦能力。

Result: 在DRIVE、STARE和CHASE_DB三个公开数据集上，LFRA-Net的Dice分数分别为84.28%、88.44%、85.50%，Jaccard指数分别为72.86%、79.31%、74.70%，参数量仅0.17M，内存占用0.66MB，计算量10.50 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: LFRA-Net在分割精度和计算成本之间提供了理想的比例，优于现有深度学习方法，适合在资源有限地区的实时临床应用。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视觉语言模型的推测解码系统，通过在线知识蒸馏和弹性视觉压缩技术，在保持输出质量的同时实现2.5-2.9倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接将推测解码技术应用于视觉语言模型面临系统约束问题：预填充阶段受视觉token数量影响，计算和内存开销大，特别是KV缓存。

Method: 建立EAGLE-2风格的基线EagleVLM，引入弹性视觉压缩器（支持剪枝、池化、卷积和重采样），提出在线logit蒸馏协议使用教师logits和倒数第二层特征训练草稿模型。

Result: 在LLaVA和MMMU数据集上，SpecVLM在5个epoch内实现2.5-2.9倍端到端加速，在不同分辨率和任务难度下保持一致性，且保持目标模型的输出分布（无损解码）。

Conclusion: SpecVLM成功解决了VLM推测解码的系统约束问题，通过在线训练和自适应压缩实现了显著加速，同时保持了模型质量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available
at https://github.com/haiduo/SpecVLM.

Method: 采用并行结构包含融合子网络和分割子网络，设计异构特征融合策略、多阶段Transformer解码器，引入基于最大最小公平分配原则的动态因子进行多任务权重分配

Result: 在广泛实验中取得与最先进方法相比具有竞争力的结果

Conclusion: MAFS框架有效实现了图像融合与语义分割任务的相互促进，为多模态视觉任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有概率验证方法难以处理现代分割任务的高维复杂性，往往产生过于保守的保证结果，缺乏实用性

Method: 结合基于采样的可达性分析和保形推理(CI)，提出新策略减少高维设置下的保守性，同时保持严谨性

Result: 在多个大规模分割数据集上验证，相比现有技术显著收紧边界，提供可靠的安全保证

Conclusion: 该方法为高维语义分割网络提供了既可靠又实用的概率验证框架，并提供了开源工具箱

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

Method: 使用生成式视觉语言模型生成合成描述来密集对齐图像与文本，利用合成描述的廉价、可扩展和易于生成的特点

Result: 在标准零样本开放词汇分割基准测试中超越了先前工作，同时具有更高的数据效率

Conclusion: 合成描述是密集对齐方法获取高层次语义理解的优秀来源，能够有效桥接生成式视觉语言模型和密集表示学习两个研究方向

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Motivation: 解决稀疏视图合成中现有方法依赖SfM相机姿态估计困难，以及MVS方法生成过多高斯点导致内存成本高的问题

Method: 利用区域分割识别结构重要区域，对密集点云进行选择性下采样，仅保留关键区域的高斯点

Conclusion: SDI-GS提高了3D高斯溅射在受限视图场景中的实用性，实现了效率和质量的双重提升

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在视频问答中往往依赖浅层相关性，导致时间定位能力弱和可解释性有限，需要更好的中间表示来增强推理能力。

Method: 提出SG-VLM模块化框架，通过提示和视觉定位将冻结的视觉语言模型与场景图基础相结合，利用符号场景图作为中间基础信号。

Result: 在三个基准测试(NExT-QA、iVQA、ActivityNet-QA)和多个VLM模型上，SG-VLM在因果推理和时间推理方面表现优异，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 符号基础在视频理解中具有潜力但当前仍有局限性，为未来混合VLM-符号方法提供了指导方向。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise
and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future
hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance

hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,
temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained

10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched
with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in

TL;DR: MOT方法在长期多动物跟踪方面优于传统MAT工具，特别是在猪只跟踪场景中，能提高牲畜自动化跟踪的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准畜牧业需要先进的监控工具来满足行业日益增长的管理需求。现有的多动物跟踪(MAT)工具虽然用户友好且广泛应用，但在性能上不如最先进的多目标跟踪(MOT)方法，导致下游任务如行为分析和健康状态估计不准确。

Method: 本研究对MAT和MOT方法进行了基准测试，比较了DeepLabCut、idTracker等MAT工具与ByteTrack、DeepSORT、cross-input consistency、Track-Anything和PromptTrack等MOT方法在10分钟猪只跟踪数据集上的表现。

Result: 结果显示，总体而言MOT方法优于传统MAT工具，即使在长期跟踪场景中也是如此。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了近期MOT技术在提高自动化牲畜跟踪准确性和可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诗歌作为表达性艺术形式具有多重解读性，读者常带入个人情感和文化背景。需要一种方法能让观众根据自己的需求修改诗歌图像

Method: 引入新颖的WPM技术，系统修改扩散模型中的注意力权重和文本嵌入，动态调整特定词汇的重要性，结合GPT等大语言模型和现有诗歌数据集

Result: 能够增强或抑制特定词汇在最终生成图像中的影响，产生语义更丰富、上下文更准确的诗歌视觉化效果

Conclusion: 这是首次将加权提示操作技术集成用于增强诗歌语言意象的尝试，为零样本诗歌图像生成提供了全面的结构化方法

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

TL;DR: SAM-TTT模型通过反向参数配置和测试时训练增强SAM在伪装目标检测中的性能，抑制不利参数同时强化有利参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM-based COD模型主要关注提取有利特征和增强有利参数，但忽视了不利参数对语义理解的负面影响

Method: 提出反向SAM参数配置模块（训练免费方式抑制不利参数）和T-Visioner模块（集成测试时训练层强化有利参数）

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中达到最先进性能，为该领域设定了新基准

Conclusion: 同时抑制不利参数和强化有利参数能显著提升SAM在COD任务中的语义理解能力

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度基础模型在支气管镜场景中缺乏解剖意识，过度拟合局部纹理而非捕捉全局气道结构，特别是在深度线索模糊和光照不良的情况下

Method: 使用深度感知CycleGAN来精炼真实支气管镜图像与解剖数据中气道几何之间的转换，并引入气道结构意识损失来强制深度一致性

Result: 在收集的离体人肺数据集和开放支气管镜数据集上验证，在解剖深度保持方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: Brea-Depth通过整合解剖先验增强了模型泛化能力，产生了更鲁棒准确的3D气道重建

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在logit空间进行线性插值的方法，混合in-distribution和out-of-distribution数据，通过平滑logits来提升OOD检测性能，特别是对于接近in-distribution的OOD数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Outlier Exposure和Mixture Outlier Exposure在训练时暴露异常数据，但模型仍难以有效学习类别间关系和清晰区分in-distribution与out-of-distribution数据。

Method: 在logit空间进行线性插值混合数据，并强制logit空间混合与输入空间混合的logits一致性，以减少决策边界附近的输出波动。

Result: 实验表明该方法减少了模型输出在决策边界附近的突变波动，实现了更平滑可靠的in-distribution与out-of-distribution数据分离，并在细粒度OOD检测任务中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: logit空间混合技术能有效提升OOD检测性能，特别是对接近in-distribution的异常数据，通过平滑logits实现更好的分类边界。

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的异构图模型用于增量式3D语义场景图预测，通过整合多模态信息（如语义嵌入和先验观察）到消息传递过程中，无需完整场景重建即可实现可扩展的实时环境理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义场景图方法主要依赖传感器数据，缺乏对语义丰富环境的进一步信息整合，且大多假设完整场景重建，限制了在真实世界增量设置中的适用性

Method: 采用异构图模型，在消息传递过程中整合多模态信息（如CLIP语义嵌入和先验观察），通过多层架构灵活结合全局和局部场景表示，无需专门模块或完整场景重建

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上的评估表明，通过多模态信息（如语义嵌入和先验观察）增强的图神经网络为复杂真实世界环境提供了可扩展和可泛化的解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人和具身AI应用提供了一种无需完整场景重建的增量式3D语义场景图预测方案，具有更好的实时应用潜力

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于像素的FER模型难以跨数据集泛化，因为面部外观是情感的间接且有偏代理。需要利用脑电信号中的深层情感信息来提升模型鲁棒性

Method: 使用EEG地形图训练的教师模型生成5x5 V/A原型网格，学生模型（ResNet-18/50）通过Proto-KD和D-Geo正则化器对齐特征和几何结构，无需部署时的非视觉信号

Result: 方法在域内和跨数据集评估中均获得一致性能提升，原型和D-Geo正则化器均贡献显著增益，5x5网格比更密集网格更稳定

Conclusion: 该框架简单、可部署，在不增加架构复杂度的前提下提高了FER模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用放射科医生的领域知识，提升对未标注3D MRI图像的诊断准确性，为颈动脉斑块易损性自动化诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合图论和优化理论，提供了一种参数效率高且性能优越的图像插值解决方案，避免了传统深度神经网络的局部最优问题

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and

powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed

a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative

conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately

Conclusion: CLAIRE方法有效解决了土地覆盖分类中的挑战，在多个基准测试中表现出竞争性性能、强泛化能力和云遮挡鲁棒性，同时通过语言模型增强了模型透明度和可解释性

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data
augmentation.

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉语言模型中连接器组件导致的信息损失问题，发现投影过程会显著扭曲视觉表示的局部几何结构，导致最近邻关系变化40-60%，并影响模型在视觉问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型通过连接器将视觉输入投影到语言模型嵌入空间，但这种投影步骤可能导致信息损失，且这种损失对模型能力的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）通过分析投影前后图像表示的k最近邻关系变化来评估语义信息保存；2）通过从投影表示重建视觉嵌入来直接测量信息损失，并在图像块级别定位损失。

Result: 实验显示连接器显著扭曲了视觉表示的局部几何结构，投影后最近邻关系变化达40-60%，与检索性能下降相关。高信息损失区域能可靠预测模型在视觉问答任务中表现不佳的实例。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型中的连接器投影过程存在显著信息损失，这种损失会影响模型性能，特别是在需要精确视觉理解的场景中。研究结果为理解和改进多模态融合提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

Conclusion: SCORE通过理论保证的对抗独立性方法，为扩散模型的安全和鲁棒概念擦除设立了新标准

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

TL;DR: RAM++是一个两阶段图像修复框架，通过自适应掩码实现内容导向的鲁棒修复，解决了现有方法在极端场景下的局限性，并在各种退化条件下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有退化导向方法在极端场景（如退化与图像结构强耦合）中的局限性，以及跨任务性能不平衡、对已见退化过拟合、对未见退化泛化能力弱等常见挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) AdaSAM预训练策略，在语义丰富和纹理区域应用像素级掩码；2) MAC选择性微调策略，调整贡献度高的层；3) RFR策略，利用DINOv2的语义一致性和退化不变表示进行特征融合。

Conclusion: RAM++通过集成高级语义理解和低级纹理生成，成功实现了内容导向的鲁棒图像修复，为图像恢复领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

TL;DR: SMARLI提出了一种基于自回归模型的布局到图像生成框架，通过结构化掩码策略和GRPO后训练方案，有效解决了布局条件稀疏和特征纠缠问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在布局条件生成中存在挑战，包括布局条件稀疏性和特征纠缠风险，需要新的方法来整合空间布局约束

Method: 采用结构化掩码策略控制注意力计算，管理全局提示、布局和图像token之间的交互；结合GRPO后训练方案和专门的布局奖励函数来提升生成质量和布局准确性

Result: 实验结果表明SMARLI能够无缝整合布局token与文本和图像token，在不影响生成质量的情况下实现优越的布局感知控制，同时保持自回归模型的结构简单性和生成效率

Conclusion: SMARLI框架成功解决了布局条件图像生成的挑战，为自回归模型在布局控制生成任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous

TL;DR: AvatarSync是一个基于音素表示的自回归框架，通过两阶段生成策略从单张参考图像生成真实可控的说话头部动画，解决了现有方法存在的帧间闪烁、身份漂移和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GAN或扩散模型的说话头部动画方法存在帧间闪烁、身份漂移和推理速度慢等固有限制，限制了其在实际应用中的适用性。

Method: 采用两阶段生成策略：第一阶段Facial Keyframe Generation通过音素-视觉映射和文本-帧因果注意力掩码生成关键帧；第二阶段基于选择性状态空间模型进行时间感知自适应插值，实现高效双向上下文推理。

Result: 大量实验表明，AvatarSync在视觉保真度、时间一致性和计算效率方面优于现有的说话头部动画方法。

Conclusion: AvatarSync提供了一个可扩展且可控的解决方案，通过解耦语义建模和视觉动态，实现了高质量、高效率的说话头部动画生成。

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

Method: 开发了胎儿特异性增强策略，模拟早期孕周特有的宫内环境和胎儿位置，通过跨群体数据增强提升模型泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过实现整个孕期内更可靠的运动姿态估计，该工作有助于在具有挑战性的4D胎儿成像设置中进行早期临床检测和干预

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state

Result: 在仿真和真实数据上实现了比现有最先进方法更好的重建质量和效率

Conclusion: 轨迹可控的展开框架能够提供平滑连续的重建路径，显著提升CASSI系统的重建性能

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

Abstract: Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

TL;DR: Reflection-V模型通过视觉中心数据构建和基于视觉注意力的奖励设计，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉反思能力，在多个视觉推理基准上取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理模型在生成长回答时对视觉信息的关注度迅速下降，缺乏有效的视觉反思能力，需要解决这一关键挑战

Method: 1) 利用VLMs和推理LLMs之间的代理交互构建视觉中心推理数据，实现冷启动学习；2) 在强化学习中使用基于视觉注意力的奖励模型来鼓励基于视觉信息的推理

Result: Reflection-V在多个视觉推理基准上表现出显著改进，并在视觉推理过程中保持对视觉信息更强、更一致的依赖

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功增强了视觉反思能力，证明通过精心设计的数据构建和奖励机制可以有效提升视觉语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出结合Vision Transformer和GNN的统一框架，用于从sMRI数据检测重度抑郁症，最佳模型达到78.98%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症检测方法主要使用体素级特征或预定义脑图谱的手工区域表示，无法捕捉复杂的大脑模式，需要更先进的深度学习方法

Method: 开发统一流水线：使用ViT从sMRI提取3D区域嵌入，使用GNN进行分类；探索两种区域定义策略（基于图谱和基于立方体），生成余弦相似度图建模区域间关系

Result: 在REST-meta-MDD数据集上，最佳模型获得78.98%准确率、76.54%灵敏度、81.58%特异度和精确度、78.98% F1分数；基于图谱的方法优于立方体方法

Conclusion: 基于图谱的模型表现更优，表明使用领域特定的解剖先验知识对抑郁症检测具有重要意义

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

Conclusion: LoRA是一种高效的大型视觉模型微调方法，在医学影像诊断任务中具有实用价值，平衡了性能与计算效率

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for
fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose
Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of
this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and
training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的训练范式成功弥合了真实数据和合成数据之间的领域差距，为真实世界服装的新视角合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉在动物行为研究中具有重要价值，但大规模视频数据标注成本高昂，需要数据高效的学习方法来解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用预训练的V-JEPA模型，采用域自适应预训练（DAP）方法，即在领域内数据上继续预训练，无需标注样本。

Result: 在两个大型猿类行为数据集（PanAf和ChimpACT）上，分别比现有最佳方法提升6.1%准确率和6.3% mAP，大部分性能提升来自DAP。

Conclusion: 该方法在动物行为识别方面具有巨大潜力，因为DAP不需要标注样本，能够有效解决大规模数据标注成本高的问题。

Abstract: Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in
ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps
allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a
bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient
learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised
learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two
datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published
state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.
mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and
applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining
with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the
DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of
animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples. Code is available at

Method: 引入OmniWorld数据集，包括新收集的OmniWorld-Game数据集和多个精选的公共数据集，涵盖多样化领域，提供更丰富的模态覆盖、更大规模和更真实的动态交互。

Result: 基于该数据集建立的基准测试暴露了当前最先进方法在复杂4D环境建模中的局限性，在OmniWorld上微调现有SOTA方法在4D重建和视频生成任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: OmniWorld作为训练和评估的强大资源，有望加速通用4D世界模型的发展，推进机器对物理世界的整体理解。

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的编辑方法依赖隐式点匹配的注意力机制，导致反演强度减弱和测试时优化成本高昂，限制了扩散模型的生成能力。

Method: 通过用户拖拽输入生成显式对应映射作为可靠参考来增强注意力控制，实现稳定的全强度反演过程，无需测试时优化。

Conclusion: LazyDrag不仅实现了最先进的性能，还为编辑范式开辟了新途径，统一了几何精确控制与文本引导，支持复杂编辑任务。

Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

Conclusion: 音频-视觉多模态方法能有效解决动画角色识别难题，为视障和听障人群提供更好的动画内容访问体验

Abstract: Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

Conclusion: DSRAG框架通过多模态知识图谱的构建和结构化检索机制，有效解决了领域特定问答中的知识准确性和上下文建模问题，为领域特定应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出WINNER初始化方法，通过根据目标信号的谱中心调整高斯噪声比例，解决隐式神经表示中的谱颈颈问题，提高高频主导信号的重构精度和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络存在谱学习偏已，低频组件先学习，高频组件后出现。当目标信号缺乏低频内容且以宽带高频主导时，会出现"谱颈颈"问题，网络无法有效重构包括其表示能力范围内的频率组件。

Method: 提出WINNER初始化方法：对均匀初始化的权重添加高斯噪声，噪声比例根据目标信号的谱中心进行自适应调整。该方法能够控制网络激活谱和神经切线内核的特征基。

Result: WINNER方法不仅解决了谱颈颈问题，还实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的表示精度。在音频重构任务中超过了现有最优方法，在图像重构和去噪任务中也获得了显著收益。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机视觉和科学机器学习领域的自适应权重初始化策略开启了新方向，能够有效处理任意频率内容的目标信号。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein
low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency
modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal
lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,
training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to
reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie
within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in
the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal
representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting
high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To
effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we
propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -
weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network
initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian
noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral
centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide
control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the
empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral
bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation
accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and
achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal
reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight
initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.

recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and
atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology.
However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging
due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and
hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose
a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized
classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure
phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is
specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner
variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively
mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation
pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and
generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent
performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it
achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505
+/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary
leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/-
0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable
solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By
addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the
potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and
improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FireGNN是一种可解释的图神经网络框架，通过集成可训练的模糊规则来增强医学图像分类的透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分类不仅需要高预测性能，还需要可解释性以确保临床信任和采用。标准GNN通常作为黑盒运行，限制了在临床环境中的透明度和可用性。

Method: 将可训练的模糊规则集成到GNN中，使用可学习的阈值和锐度参数嵌入拓扑描述符（节点度、聚类系数和标签一致性），实现内在符号推理。同时探索辅助自监督任务来评估拓扑学习的贡献。

Result: 在五个MedMNIST基准测试和合成数据集MorphoMNIST上实现了强大的性能，同时生成可解释的基于规则的解释。

Conclusion: 这是首次在GNN中集成可训练模糊规则的工作，为医学图像分类提供了高性能和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance
but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures
within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting
transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we
present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that
integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification.
These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering
coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness
parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore
auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity
entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning.
Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST
benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating
interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first
integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

Motivation: 宫颈癌筛查存在障碍，特别是在资源匮乏地区。无窥器设备需要可靠的视觉引导来改善筛查可及性

Method: 比较了五种编码器-解码器架构，使用IARC宫颈图像数据集的913帧图像，采用十折交叉验证评估性能指标

Result: EndoViT/DPT（基于Vision Transformer）获得最高DICE分数（0.50±0.31）和检测率（0.87±0.33），在21.5 FPS下实现实时分割

Conclusion: 研究为将自动化宫颈口识别集成到无窥器筛查设备奠定了基础，支持非专业人员在各种资源环境下使用

Abstract: Cervical cancer is highly preventable, yet persistent barriers to screening
limit progress toward elimination goals. Speculum-free devices that integrate
imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource
settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep
learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal
endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913
frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by
gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and
distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision
transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm
0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches.
External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under
variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These
results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into
speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both
high- and low-resource contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 医学视觉基础模型在自适应下游评估（特别是分割任务）中性能有限，需要设计高效微调方法来最大化目标域性能，同时避免随机样本选择的信息冗余

Method: 采用主动学习策略，设计DKD和ASD两个查询指标来选择信息量最大的目标域样本，并结合选择性半监督微调方法

Result: 提出的ASFDA方法能够以最小样本预算实现医学视觉基础模型在目标域上的最优性能

Conclusion: 该方法为医学视觉基础模型的高效域适应提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于医学图像分割任务

Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of
interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised
pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on
adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from
target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks
works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal
performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to
design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative
samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve
this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to
efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image
segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select
the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs
without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their
performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an
Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target
domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD)
and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the
source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the
knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and
semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate
the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive
entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method
employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and
efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from
unqueried ones.

TL;DR: 利用Sentinel-2卫星影像和时间序列分析，开发了一种检测番茄田中寄生植物分枝列当的端到端管道，通过LSTM网络实现了87%的测试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分枝列当是一种叶绿素缺乏的寄生植物，可从番茄宿主中提取养分，导致产量损失高达80%。其主要地下生命周期和大量种子生产（每株超过20万粒种子，可存活20年）使得早期检测至关重要。

Method: 使用Sentinel-2影像处理12个光谱波段和太阳-传感器几何数据，计算20个植被指数（如NDVI、NDMI），并通过神经网络推导5种植被性状。利用长短期记忆（LSTM）网络对18,874个像素在48个生长度日时间点进行训练。

Result: 模型达到88%的训练准确率和87%的测试准确率，精确率0.86，召回率0.92，F1分数0.89。排列特征重要性显示NDMI、冠层叶绿素含量、FAPAR和叶绿素红边指数最具信息量。

Conclusion: 结果表明卫星驱动的时间序列建模在番茄农场寄生胁迫的可扩展检测方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient
parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from
the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean
life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant,
viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an
end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to
identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest
were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10
percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and
sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and
derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy
Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,
and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with
ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content
delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using
growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day
time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent
test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation
feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a
chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the
physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of
satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic
stress in tomato farms.

Conclusion: 该系统为微笑设计提供了自动化解决方案，收集的数据可用于美学偏好分析，有助于提升牙科实践中微笑设计的知识水平

Abstract: A healthy smile plays a significant role in functional as well as esthetic
considerations, improving confidence. It is difficult for dental professionals
to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements.
Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used
plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for
patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows
photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication
among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and
big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of
personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however,
susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be
suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a
comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to
automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced
dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial
Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse
practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future
research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality
for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic
preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental
practice.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They
can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize
patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing
spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals
for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm
feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio
classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be
clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and
rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks
using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE能够有效提升联邦目标检测的跨域性能，且不会给客户端带来额外计算负担，具有很好的实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.

Method: 采用神经科学启发的潜在重放方法，仅存储模型内部架构提取的紧凑高级特征表示，而非完整图像，减少内存使用同时保留关键信息

Conclusion: 潜在重放方法为生成式AI模型实现了高效的持续学习，为能够随用户需求演化而无需过高计算成本的个性化文本到图像模型开辟了道路

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

Result: 在Crunchbase初创公司成功预测任务上达到超过80%的准确率，显著优于传统分类器和基线LLM，并提供可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过领域感知微调和结构化-非结构化数据融合，可以显著提升创业结果预测建模能力，为风险投资和创新政策提供方法论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于去噪扩散模型的随机平滑方法会因噪声估计错误引入协变量偏移，从而降低分类器性能

Method: 设计了一个专注于去噪扩散模型添加噪声的对抗目标函数，训练基础分类器使其对去噪器引入的协变量偏移具有鲁棒性

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet三个标准分类基准上显著提高了认证精度，实现了l2对抗扰动的最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过针对去噪扩散模型噪声估计问题的对抗训练，有效解决了协变量偏移问题，提升了随机平滑方法的性能

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly
available at

TL;DR: 本文研究数据选择策略对自回归扩散模型在天气预测中的影响，发现时间分层采样方法仅使用20%训练数据就能达到或超越全数据训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习扩散模型在集合天气预报中显示出潜力，但这些自回归模型计算成本高昂，而气候科学中数据往往有限、昂贵或难以处理，因此需要探索高效的数据选择方法

Method: 评估多种数据采样策略，特别是时间分层采样方法，在自回归扩散模型上进行实验比较

Result: 简单的时间分层采样方法使用仅20%训练数据就能实现与全数据训练相似或更好的性能，在某些指标上甚至超越全数据模型

Conclusion: 研究证明了扩散模型数据高效训练的可行性，特别是在天气预报领域，并激励未来开发超越随机或纯时间采样的自适应或模型感知采样方法

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SelectMix是一个针对噪声标签的置信度引导混合框架，通过K折交叉验证识别噪声样本，并选择性地与置信样本混合，使用软标签确保监督信号与混合输入对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易记忆噪声标签，严重影响泛化性能。现有的Mixup方法缺乏样本选择和混合策略的指导，无意中传播了噪声监督。

Method: 使用K折交叉验证进行置信度不匹配分析识别噪声样本，选择性地将不确定样本与置信预测的同类样本混合，并采用基于混合比例的软标签。

Result: 在多个合成和真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，SelectMix始终优于强基线方法，验证了其在噪声标签学习中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SelectMix通过置信度引导的混合策略有效解决了噪声标签问题，提高了模型的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: 提出了PersonaX多模态数据集，包含名人(CelebPersona)和运动员(AthlePersona)的行为特征评估、面部图像和传记信息，用于研究行为特征与多模态数据的关系，并提出了因果表示学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源很少提供结合行为描述符与面部属性和传记信息的多模态数据集，无法全面分析人类行为特征。

Method: 构建了两个多模态数据集，使用三个高性能大语言模型推断行为特征评估，采用统计独立性检验和新的因果表示学习(CRL)框架来分析多模态数据关系。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验证明了方法的有效性，能够统一结构化和非结构化分析。

Conclusion: PersonaX为研究LLM推断的行为特征与视觉和传记属性的结合提供了基础，推动了多模态特征分析和因果推理的发展。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpeCa是一个基于推测采样的扩散模型加速框架，通过预测-验证机制实现6-7倍加速，质量损失极小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型计算需求大，存在严格时间依赖无法并行化，每个去噪步骤都需要大量计算，限制了实时应用

Method: 引入推测采样到扩散模型，预测后续时间步特征，使用参数无关验证机制评估预测可靠性，动态分配计算资源

Result: FLUX加速6.34倍(质量下降5.5%)，DiT加速7.3倍(保真度不变)，HunyuanVideo加速6.1倍(VBench得分79.84%)

Conclusion: SpeCa为高效扩散模型推理建立了新范式，在激进加速比下仍能保持生成质量，验证开销极小(1.67%-3.5%)

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型基础模型的兴起，分割推理成为流行部署范式，但现有数据重建攻击主要针对小型CNN分类模型，大型基础模型在分割推理中的隐私风险尚未充分探索

Method: 基于引导扩散的数据重建攻击，利用在大规模数据集上预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）中嵌入的先验知识，在LDM学习到的图像先验上进行迭代重建

Result: 在视觉基础模型的深层中间表示重建方面，该方法在定性和定量上都显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在分割推理场景中为大型模型开发更强大隐私保护机制的紧迫性

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: FedDAF是一种联邦域自适应方法，通过计算模型功能距离来解决域偏移和目标数据稀缺问题，在目标数据上计算平均梯度场角度并使用Gompertz函数归一化，实现基于目标目标的模型聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FDA方法主要关注域偏移问题，假设目标数据充足，往往忽视了域偏移和数据稀缺的双重挑战，且未能根据目标目标优先共享源客户端的相关信息。

Method: FedDAF使用相似性聚合全局源模型和目标模型，通过计算在目标数据上的平均梯度场来计算模型功能距离，计算两个模型平均梯度场之间的角度并用Gompertz函数归一化，通过简单平均聚合所有本地源模型构建全局源模型。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FedDAF在测试准确率方面优于现有的FL、PFL和FDA方法。

Conclusion: FedDAF有效解决了联邦域自适应中的域偏移和目标数据稀缺双重挑战，通过基于目标目标的模型聚合实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

TL;DR: 利用叶片光谱反射率和集成机器学习方法，在番茄生长早期阶段（585 GDD）实现了89%准确率的支列列当感染检测，但在后期阶段准确率下降至69%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支列列当是一种缺乏叶绿素的寄生杂草，通过从宿主提取养分威胁番茄生产，需要开发早期检测方法来支持针对性干预和减少产量损失。

Method: 在田间实验中跟踪300株番茄植株，使用便携式光谱仪获取叶片反射率（400-2500 nm），进行预处理（波段去噪、1 nm插值、Savitzky-Golay平滑、基于相关的波段缩减），并采用集成学习方法（随机森林、XGBoost、SVM with RBF kernel、朴素贝叶斯）。

Result: 在585 GDD时达到89%的检测准确率，感染植株召回率0.86，非感染植株召回率0.93；但在1568 GDD时准确率降至69%。在1500 nm和2000 nm水吸收特征附近观察到明显的类别差异。

Conclusion: 尽管感染植株数量少且存在环境干扰因素，近端传感与集成学习能够在冠层症状可见之前及时检测支列列当感染，支持针对性干预措施。

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为多模态检索建立信息理论基础，解决"每个查询需要多少比特才能实现高质量检索"这一根本问题，并为对比学习目标、持续学习检索器和检索增强生成器提供设计指导。

Method: 将排序建模为有损源编码问题，推导出单字母率失真函数R(D)；构建显式的熵加权随机量化器，采用自适应模态温度解码器；使用Blahut-Arimoto算法证明方案性能；进行VC类型分析得到有限样本风险界。

Result: 理论证明量化器在n个训练三元组下能达到与R(D)相差O(n^{-1})的失真；实验在控制高斯混合和Flickr30k数据集上显示自适应编码器距离理论前沿仅差2个百分点，显著优于固定温度和朴素CLIP基线。

Conclusion: 提出了多模态检索的首个信息理论极限框架，证明了熵不平衡和跨模态冗余的影响，为实际系统设计提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval.
Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter
rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a
converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty
$\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We
then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an
adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows
this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training
triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound
whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the
entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm
that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical
frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly.
Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per
query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design
guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning
retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Chameleon攻击框架，针对LVLM驱动的GUI代理在动态网页环境中的安全漏洞，通过LLM驱动的环境模拟和注意力黑洞机制，显著提升了在现实威胁模型下的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对GUI代理的环境注入攻击假设过于理想化，未能充分考虑现实网页的动态性和触发图像的小尺寸特征，导致攻击方法在真实场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出Chameleon攻击框架，包含两个核心创新：1）LLM驱动的环境模拟，自动生成多样化高保真网页模拟；2）注意力黑洞机制，将注意力权重转化为显式监督信号引导代理关注触发区域。

Result: 在6个真实网站和4个代表性LVLM GUI代理上的评估显示，Chameleon显著优于现有方法，消融研究证实两个创新点对性能都至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代GUI代理中未被充分探索的漏洞，为开放世界GUI代理系统的防御研究奠定了坚实基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites.
However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to
Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage
elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can
only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier
assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still
fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context
remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the
dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an
unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To
better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model
where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and
embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing
attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.
  To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an
attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment
Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage
simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention
weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward
the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4
representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms
existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to
performance. Our findings reveal underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI
agents and establish a robust foundation for future research on defense in
open-world GUI agent systems. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂3D环境中推理轨迹不连贯、不稳定，以及难以平衡长时程语义推理和低延迟实时导航控制的问题

Method: 构建Nav-CoT-110K大规模CoT数据集，设计基于GRPO的强化学习框架（包含格式、理解和导航三种奖励），引入快速-慢速推理范式分离语义推理和反应控制

Result: 在具身AI基准测试中持续超越强基线，推理和导航性能平均提升超过8%，在移动机器人上的真实部署验证了其在有限资源下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: Nav-R1成功统一了具身环境中的推理，通过结构化推理初始化、多奖励强化学习和解耦推理范式，实现了高效且连贯的导航性能

Abstract: Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and
action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches
often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder
generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing
long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time
navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied
foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first
construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought
(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with
structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based
reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,
understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic
grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow
reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency
reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations
on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms
strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation
performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its
robustness under limited onboard resources. Code:

Motivation: 真实世界机器人操作中，固定视角训练的视觉RL策略在相机位置变化时容易失败，现有方法依赖精确相机标定或难以处理大视角变化。

Method: 采用ViewNet模块自动将任意视角的点云观测对齐到统一空间坐标系，无需外部标定；开发高效GPU加速批量渲染模块，每秒处理超过5000帧。

Conclusion: 学习几何一致表示对于非结构化环境中可扩展机器人操作非常有效，系统展现出强大的仿真到真实性能。

Abstract: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world
manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained
from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an
unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to
manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration
or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we
propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic
manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through
self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates
ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point
cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate
system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an
efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over
5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at
unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world
tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than
state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer
parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong
sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically
consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured
environments. Our project website can be found in

TL;DR: DreamNav是一个零样本视觉语言导航方法，通过视角对齐、轨迹级规划和主动想象来解决现有方法成本高、语义不对齐和短视规划的问题，在VLN-CE和真实世界测试中达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本VLN方法依赖昂贵的感知和被动场景理解，只能进行点级选择，导致部署成本高、动作语义不对齐且规划短视。

Method: 提出DreamNav方法，包含三个核心组件：EgoView Corrector对齐视角稳定感知；Trajectory Predictor进行全局轨迹级规划；Imagination Predictor赋予主动想象能力实现前瞻性规划。

Result: 在VLN-CE和真实世界测试中，DreamNav相比最强基线在SR和SPL指标上分别提升7.49%和18.15%，成为首个统一轨迹级规划和主动想象的零样本VLN方法。

Conclusion: DreamNav通过创新的视角对齐、轨迹级规划和主动想象机制，成功解决了零样本视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种保护预训练特征的视觉-语言-动作模型微调框架，通过双编码器设计、字符串动作标记化和协同训练策略，提高了机器人操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从视觉语言模型微调VLA模型往往会破坏预训练表征并限制泛化能力，需要更好地保留预训练特征同时适应机器人操作任务

Method: 采用三个核心组件：(i)双编码器设计（一个冻结视觉编码器保留特征，一个可训练编码器适应任务）(ii)字符串动作标记化将连续动作转为字符序列(iii)协同训练策略结合机器人演示数据和强调空间推理的视觉语言数据集

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上的评估表明，该方法相比基线提高了对视觉扰动的鲁棒性、对新指令和环境的泛化能力以及整体任务成功率

Conclusion: 该框架有效保留了预训练特征，同时成功适应机器人操作任务，为构建通用机器人系统提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models
(VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build
generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct
fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits
generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained
features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces
three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to
retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a
string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character
sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training
strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets
emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on
real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations,
generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success
compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了并行异步问答问题(EQsA)和ParaEQsA框架，通过优先级规划和共享记忆模块实现多问题并行处理，在PAEQs基准测试中表现优于传统顺序方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EQA只能处理单个问题，而实际部署中需要处理多个异步到达且具有不同紧急程度的问题，需要更高效的并行调度机制

Method: 提出ParaEQsA框架，包含共享记忆模块减少冗余探索，优先级规划模块动态调度问题，支持并行异步问答处理

Result: 在包含200个问题的PAEQs基准上，ParaEQsA在DAR和NUWL指标上均优于顺序基线方法，减少了探索和延迟

Conclusion: 紧急程度感知的并行调度是实现具身智能体在现实多问题工作负载下高效响应的关键

Abstract: This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,
introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the
problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as
answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real
deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive
asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as
Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for
parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group
memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a
priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this
setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)
benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in
total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We
further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and
Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency
and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong
sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing
exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative
contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,
and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results
demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied
agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

TL;DR: 提出了KORR框架，结合Koopman算子理论进行全局动力学建模，指导残差策略学习，在长时程精细机器人装配任务中显著提升性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习在长时程任务和高精度控制中存在累积误差问题，现有残差策略学习方法缺乏对状态演化的全局理解，限制了在未见场景中的鲁棒性和泛化性

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论在学习潜在空间中施加线性时不变结构，通过Koopman预测的潜在状态来条件化残差修正，提出KORR框架实现全局信息指导的动作精炼

Result: 在多种扰动下的长时程精细机器人家具装配任务中，相比强基线方法取得了持续的性能提升、鲁棒性增强和泛化能力改善

Conclusion: Koopman-based建模有潜力将现代学习方法与经典控制理论相结合，KORR框架为残差策略学习提供了简单有效的全局动力学指导方案

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please

TL;DR: 使用U-Net深度学习和几何分析管道定量研究Bi:YIG薄膜中迷宫状磁条纹图案的演化，识别出两种不同的演化模式并与磁场极性相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迷宫状条纹图案在物理系统中常见但缺乏长程有序性，定量表征具有挑战性，需要开发新方法来研究其几何和拓扑特性

Method: 采用U-Net深度学习模型进行图像分割，结合骨架化、图映射和样条拟合的几何分析管道，对444张图像进行局部条纹传播的长度和曲率测量

Result: 成功量化了从"淬火"态到"退火"态的转变过程，识别出与磁场极性相关的两种不同演化模式（A型和B型）

Conclusion: 建立了分析复杂迷宫系统的通用工具，为磁性条纹图案的几何和拓扑特性提供了定量分析，并揭示了其局部结构演化的新见解

Abstract: Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their
lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We
investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet
(Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep
learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white
Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental
magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this
segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on
skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local
stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this
framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the
transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed"
state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to
field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and
topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into
their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing
complex labyrinthine systems.

for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based
program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through
an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the
framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training
data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform
GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting
interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The
end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature
extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular
architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while
supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several
unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework
demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary
tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a
CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and
clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized
medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个自演化的文本到图像生成系统，通过多模态LLM代理进行自我批判和演化，无需人工干预即可自动改进生成图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型对人工干预的高度依赖问题，减少手动提示工程的需求，提高用户体验

Method: 采用两个关键技术：1) 自我批判机制 - 使用多模态LLM作为评论家识别图像弱点并提供编辑信号；2) 自我演化机制 - 使用MLLM作为裁判进行图像比较，淘汰问题图像并演化创意提示

Result: 在复杂文本到图像任务上的广泛实验表明，Maestro显著优于初始提示和最先进的自动化方法，且效果随MLLM组件的高级程度而提升

Conclusion: 这项工作为自改进的文本到图像生成提供了一个强大、可解释且有效的途径

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

TL;DR: 对5种VLA模型在边缘和数据中心GPU平台上的性能评估，发现架构选择对吞吐量和内存影响显著，边缘设备在功率限制下表现出非线性性能下降，某些配置甚至优于旧数据中心GPU


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型作为机器人控制的通用策略虽然强大，但其在不同模型架构和硬件平台上的性能扩展以及相关功耗预算仍缺乏深入理解

Method: 使用LIBERO基准测试，在变化的边缘功率约束和高性能数据中心GPU配置下，测量五个代表性VLA模型的准确性和系统级指标（延迟、吞吐量、峰值内存使用）

Result: 识别出三个显著的扩展趋势：架构选择强烈影响吞吐量和内存占用；功率受限的边缘设备表现出非线性性能下降；某些配置匹配或超过旧数据中心GPU；高吞吐量变体可以在不显著损失准确性的情况下实现

Conclusion: 这些发现为在不同部署约束下选择和优化VLA模型提供了可行的见解，挑战了当前关于数据中心硬件在机器人推理中优越性的假设

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

TL;DR: LLMs在复杂文本鉴别诊断方面超越医生表现，能有效模拟专家医学演示，但在图像解读和文献检索方面仍有不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI在医学诊断中的多方面推理和演示能力，超越仅关注最终诊断的传统评估方法

Method: 使用7102个临床病理会议案例和1021个图像挑战创建CPC-Bench基准，评估领先LLMs，并开发Dr. CaBot AI讨论系统

Result: o3模型在60%案例中排名第一诊断，84%进入前十；在图像挑战中准确率达67%；CaBot生成的内容在74%试验中被医生误认为人类专家所写

Conclusion: LLMs在文本诊断方面表现优异，但在图像和文献任务上仍需改进；CPC-Bench和CaBot有助于透明追踪医学AI进展

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: AD-GS是一种交替密度化框架，通过高低密度化阶段交替来改善3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图下的表现，减少伪影并提高几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图设置下容易出现浮动物体、几何不准确和过拟合等问题，主要原因是无控制的密度化过程。

Method: 提出交替密度化框架AD-GS，包含高密度化阶段（积极添加高斯基元）和低密度化阶段（积极修剪不透明度并正则化几何），通过伪视图一致性和边缘感知深度平滑进行正则化。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，AD-GS相比现有方法显著提高了渲染质量和几何一致性。

Conclusion: 交替密度化方法通过精心控制模型容量增长，逐步细化场景表示，有效减少了过拟合问题，提升了稀疏视图下的3D重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel
view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,
producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and
overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor
is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without
guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel
alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification
phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed
by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low
densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians
followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and
edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting
by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the
scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate
that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency
compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: SH-SAS是一种新颖的隐式神经表示方法，使用球谐系数表示复杂声学散射场，直接从一维飞行时间信号训练，无需中间波束形成图像监督，在3D重建质量和几何指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时域反投影算法无法建模方向性，存在采样限制、混叠和遮挡问题；现有神经体积方法将每个体素视为各向同性散射密度，无法捕捉各向异性返回。

Method: 提出SH-SAS隐式神经表示，将复杂声学散射场表示为球谐系数集合，使用多分辨率哈希编码器和轻量级MLP输出复数SH系数，零阶系数作为各向同性散射场和密度项，高阶系数紧凑捕获方向性散射。

Result: 在合成和真实SAS（空气中和水下）基准测试中，SH-SAS在3D重建质量和几何指标方面表现优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SH-SAS成功解决了传统方法的方向性建模问题，通过球谐表示和隐式神经网络的结合，实现了更高质量的3D合成孔径声纳重建。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the
spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent
response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction
algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling
limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied
to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering
density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit
neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a
set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder
feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified
degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,
which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture
directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model
predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is
performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform
intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air
and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms
of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.
