While\nexisting methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with\nlong-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video\ncontent, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly\nused. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of\ncrucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar\nframes. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions\naccurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video\nsegments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model\nto guide the frame sampling process. We propose \"moment sampling\", a novel,\nmodel-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant\nframes according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a\nlightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing\non the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances\nlong-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on\nfour long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cmoment sampling\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e27\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u5e38\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6216\u5305\u542b\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201cmoment sampling\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201cmoment sampling\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

This contrast is\nprimarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition\ntime, which are stored in the DICOM metadata.

Data pruning\noffers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing\nmethods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while\nmodel-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally\nprohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid\nframework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with\nmodel-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions\ndata and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy\nmodel to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by\ncomparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal\nadaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more\naggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in\ninformative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection\nbenchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster\nR-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms\nprominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over\n54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model\nperformance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing\ndata efficiency for large-scale model training.

However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts\nits adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks\nare often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive\nLoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or\nselectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on\ncomputationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,\nor additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable\nRank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the\nstable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise\nrank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic\ndimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient\nredistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring\nadditional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with\nsignificant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent\nadaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and\nefficiency.

Handling the\nlow-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, \"black-box\" backbones\nleads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of\nmultiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we\nintroduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the \"MIV-head\",\nakin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and\ncomputationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when\ntrained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong\nperformance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without\nfine-tuning the backbone, and within the \"meta-testing\" phase. Experimenting\nunder various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for\ncross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf\nconvolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on\nImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when\ncompared to state-of-the-art \"adapter\" (or partially fine-tuning) methods\napplied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation\ncost.

Moreover, the perceptual\ndefects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential\nsecurity issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an\ninitial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots\nin current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new\nconcept, {\\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting\nuncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,\nwe delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named\nVPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12\ndistortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies.

This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in\ngeneralizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use\ntwo-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories\nusing cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text\nfeatures, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text\nalignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is\nhindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed\nskeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective\nskeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and\nunseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided\nfeature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,\ntermed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive\ntraining framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient\ndiscrimination for skeleton features.

To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel\ndataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140\nstudents in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,\nlaboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual\nstudy. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators\nusing two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,\nenhancing annotation consistency and reliability.

Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification\naccuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per\nvehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields\nthe best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an\naccuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True\nPositive Rate).

Previous wireframe-alignment-based method\nLoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.\nHowever, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the\nmajority of available models and those many countries plan to construct\nnationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD\ncity models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To\naddress these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization\nover low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc\nv2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.\nThen, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by\nuniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose\nprobability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of\nalignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose\nwith maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a\nparticle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used\nto efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose\nestimation.

However, its quadratic complexity limits its\napplicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar\nformulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling\nefficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers\nfrom a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax\nAttention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based\non the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,\nLinear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.\nThis prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the\nQuery scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax\nAttention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score\ndistribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear\nAttention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully\nincorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an\nattention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while\nexhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of\nMALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,\ninstance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,\nspeech recognition, and image generation.

Project page: https://zifuwan.github.io/ONLY/", "summary": "Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm\nfor understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.\nAlthough they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of\nmulti-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which\nintroduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable\ndeployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive\ndecoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original\nLVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,\nthese methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response\ngeneration, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that\nrequires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,\nenabling efficient real-time deployment.

When predictions\nare ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by\ngenerating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions\nand incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This\nhierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts\nwithout the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our\napproach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent\nimprovements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness\nof combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiMo-GUI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GUI\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u591a\u6837\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06GUI\u5206\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u6807\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7126\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6GUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DiMo-GUI\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GUI\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u3002"}}

While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate\nperformance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically\nfail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at\n100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms.

Furthermore, they overlook the\nimpact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading\nto safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In\nthis paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)\nas new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time\nand physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for\nreal-time 3D object detection.

The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining\nraw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases\nand supported understanding across skill levels.

However, clinical methods\nfor FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to\napply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are\nbased on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial\ninformation, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the\nfirst method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach\nintegrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic\nsample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses\nmulti-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel\nattention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates\nsynthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from\ndifferent fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nperformance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean\nabsolute percentage error of $5.1\\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and\napproaching the accuracy of a senior doctor.

Accepted by MICCAI 2025", "summary": "Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an\noptimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,\nrecent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic\nthis process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed\nnumber of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient\niterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence\nguarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have\na practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with\nthe unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both\ntheoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration\nframework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration\nas an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between\nclassical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods.

Brain, artery, vein, and\ncavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible\nFPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)\nvein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more\nthan artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79\nfalse-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were\ncommonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;\n3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular\n(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing\nCPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without\nreducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from\n1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable\npost-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance.

Given a language\ncommand and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential\ndemonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters\nout results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts\nobject trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the\nrobot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world\nevaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real\ndemonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also\nshow that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives\nsuch as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking\noutperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point\ntracking.

Once trained, the tokenizer can be\nseamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,\nfrom short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning.

To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated\nenvironments and on real robotic platforms.
